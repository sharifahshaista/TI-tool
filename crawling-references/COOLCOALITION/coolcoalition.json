    "content": "Cooling demand in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is surging as countries work to prevent further warming and phase down HFCs under the Kigali Amendment. This project supports MENA nations in developing National Cooling Action Plans (NCAPs) to accelerate climate-friendly cooling, reduce emissions, and build resilience against rising heat.\nWHY NCAPS IN MENA?\nThe MENA region faces rapidly increasing demand for cooling, driven by its hot climate, urbanization, and economic growth. At the same time, MENA countries are working to meet their commitments under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol the Paris Agreement, phasing down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) while transitioning to climate-friendly cooling technologies.\nNCAPs provide a vital framework to address this challenge, helping countries develop targeted policies, market incentives, and strategies to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency in the cooling sector. By adopting NCAPs, MENA countries can unlock the potential to:\n  * Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 210–460 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalent globally over the next four decades.\n  * Build the political will for cross-economy cooling strategies that align with international climate goals.\n  * Implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and any other national development strategies.\n  * Mitigate their vulnerability to rising heat.\n  * Adapt and build their resilience to extreme heat.\n\n\nThis initiative is particularly critical as the region faces growing climate risks and the urgent need to balance rising cooling demand with sustainable solutions. NCAPs will not only accelerate the transition to climate-friendly cooling but also contribute to limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C while ensuring public health and safety in a warming world.\nPROJECT OBJECTIVES\nThis project aims to catalyze a policy transformation across the MENA region to accelerate the shift to climate-friendly cooling. By developing NCAPs, the initiative will enable countries to meet their Kigali Amendment commitments while addressing the region’s growing demand for cooling sustainably.\nKey objectives include:\n  * Building capacity among MENA region countries to develop and implement NCAPs in line with the Kigali Amendment by the end of the project.\n  * Developing actionable NCAPs that can be adopted by at least two countries as models for broader regional adoption.\n  * Enhancing awareness and skills among national governments to create policies that support climate-friendly cooling technologies and the phase-down of HFC emissions.\n\n\nThrough these efforts, the project seeks to empower MENA countries to become leaders in sustainable cooling, reducing greenhouse gas emissions while safeguarding populations from the impacts of rising temperatures.\nWHAT WILL THE PROJECT DO\nThe project will work across three components:\n#### Component 1: Adapting NCAP Methodology for the MENA Region\n  * Tailor the Cool Coalition’s NCAP framework to meet MENA-specific needs.\n  * Develop regionally adapted guidelines and training materials.\n  * Create outreach materials for capacity building in the region.\n\n\n#### Component 2: Pilot Implementation in Two Countries\n  * Select two pilot countries through government consultation.\n  * Map cooling demand and recommend sector-specific solutions.\n  * Draft customized NCAPs for the pilot countries.\n\n\n#### Component 3: Regional Knowledge Exchange and Capacity Building\n  * Facilitate national workshops and stakeholder coordination.\n  * Share NCAP best practices through briefings and infographics.\n  * Organize regional workshops for collaboration and knowledge-sharing.\n\n\nFUNDING AND PARTNERS\n**Funding Partner** Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC)\n**Implementation Partners** UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Regional Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (RCREEE)"

    "content": "India experienced severe heat waves in 2024, with temperatures in northwest India soaring close to 50°C. Authorities reported over 40,000 heatstroke cases across 17 states. As extreme heat events intensify, the need for robust Heat Action Plans (HAPs) has never been more urgent.\nThe India Cooling Action Plan (ICAP) highlights urgent needs for development of HAPs on priority. Such HAPs address short-term risks and propose cross-departmental emergency actions during heatwaves. Additionally, many Indian cities are developing HAPs that begin to integrate long-term heat mitigation including sustainable cooling measures such as urban greening and cool roofs.\nGlobally this is also seen in leading cities using HAPs to mobilize urgent cross-departmental actions during heatwaves, but also to mitigate future heat risks through the redesign of the built environment. In 2024, the \nHowever, where and when to prioritise heatwave mitigation in a city and how to finance such interventions are critical knowledge gaps, both in India and globally.\nTo help address this, UNEP Cool Coalition supported India’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to co-host an International Workshop on Heat Waves on 13-14 February 2025 in New Delhi. Over 15 Cool Coalition partners were present including from within India and around the world. Centered on the theme “Advancing City-Level Heat Action Plans: Multi-Sectoral Adaptation for Resilient Communities,” the workshop brought together national and international experts, policymakers, practitioners, and senior officials from heat-prone Indian states.\nThis marked a significant evolution of past national editions of the workshop, with Cool Coalition members and champion cities globally introducing global perspectives. The workshop also created a platform for cross-country learning, enabling representatives from other nations to adapt several of India’s leading strategies to their own contexts.\nDr. Balakrishna Pisupati, UNEP India Country Head, addressed the inaugural session, commending India’s proactive efforts in tackling extreme heat. He emphasized the need for a multidisciplinary approach, stating, “Technical solutions for many heat-related challenges exist, but they must be reinforced by strong policies at global, regional, national, and sub-national levels.” He also underscored the importance of breaking silos and fostering deeper coordination across governance levels and sectors.\nAcross various sessions in the workshop, the importance of Urban Heat Island Effect (UHIE) mapping in supporting effective heat mitigation strategies was strongly emphasized. UNEP and CEPT University presented a National Methodology for UHIE assessment which collects and overlaps data on land and air temperature, land-use cover, building form, surface materials and nature of green cover. This methodology has been tested in Tamil Nadu and UNEP Cool Coalition will partner with NDMA to ensure its further testing in the country.\nUNEP Cool Coalition partners also presented the City Chief Heat Officer model, with Jane Gilbert, Chief Heat Officer of Miami-Dade County, showcasing various mapping and community activities led under the Climate & Heat Health Task Force, which she chairs. Dr. Eleni Myrivili emphasized the critical role of Chief Heat Officers for cities in driving both short-term preparedness and long-term urban redesign to mitigate extreme heat. NDMA highlighted that a key takeaway from the workshop was the need to replicate the City Heat Officer model as part of effective heat governance.\n### **Workshop Outcomes**\nThe workshop focused on key strategies to strengthen and expand heat adaptation efforts:\n  * Strengthening and scaling up city-level heat action plans and including long-term “redesign” of cities to mitigate extreme heat\n  * Innovative financing of HAPs and cities’ efforts to redesign and promote sustainable cooling\n  * Enhancing vertical and horizontal coordination across central ministries, state departments and with Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) for implementation of heat action plans, including roll-out of Heat Officers in India’s ULBs.\n  * Scaling up of innovative cooling solutions for the most vulnerable including passive cooling\n  * Further development of early warning systems.\n\n\nUnder the India Cooling Action Plan, India aims to reduce cooling demand by up to 25%, refrigerant demand by 25-30% and cooling energy requirements by up to 40% by 2038 while ensuring affordability and protecting citizens from high temperatures. UNEP is working with Government of India to support ICAP implementation under the framework of the Cool Coalition, including embedding heat resilience and sustainable cooling into urban planning, food system designs, governance frameworks, and climate strategies.\nThe NDMA Heatwave Workshop Proceedings are available [here](https://coolcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/International-Workshop-on-Heatwaves-2025.pdf)."

    "content": "Equitable access to sustainable cooling has become an urgent global development priority. As heatwaves intensify and energy inequality persists, cooling is increasingly the difference between safety and vulnerability, between development gains and humanitarian setbacks. On 24 July 2025, Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) launched the seventh edition of the \nModerator Rosa Garcia, Energy Efficiency and Cooling Officer at SEforALL, opened the session referencing striking findings from the \nBen Hartley, SEforALL Programme Manager for Cooling, presented these findings and their implications, warning that under current trends, the number of high-risk individuals could rise to 1.05 billion by 2030. “Cooling underpins the ability of millions to escape poverty, to keep classrooms cool, vaccines stable, food nutritious, and economies productive,” he emphasized. Hartley outlined diverging global trends, pointing to China’s rapid progress in shifting populations toward lower risk categories, while noting increased vulnerability in Sub-Saharan African nations such as Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, and Sudan, primarily due to persistent energy access challenges and rapid urbanisation.\nEchoing the call for systemic responses, Minni Sastry, Extreme Heat and Sustainable Cooling Advisor at the UNEP Cool Coalition, stressed the importance of integrating cooling strategies into long-term urban planning. India, she explained, is experiencing increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves, with certain regions surpassing 50°C. In response, UNEP collaborated with India’s National Disaster Management Authority to evolve heat action plans from short-term emergency measures to comprehensive frameworks that now include urban heat island mapping, along with long term strategies for passive cooling, including nature-based solutions. “The success of cooling action plans depends on their integration with master planning processes, zoning policies, and local infrastructure upgrades,” Sastry explained, referencing pilot initiatives in New Delhi’s bus terminals and Chennai’s suggested revisions for city master plan, where heat-mitigation measures are being embedded into urban frameworks.\nKeeping the discussion grounded in local realities, Felix Akello, Chief Heat Officer and Energy Planning Lead for the County Government of Kisumu, Kenya, shared his experience of translating global pledges into county-level implementation. Kisumu is one of eight Kenyan counties to have submitted targets under the [Global Cooling Pledge](https://coolcoalition.org/global-cooling-pledge/), which now includes over 70 countries and 80 non-state actors committed to slashing cooling-related emissions by 68% by 2050 while also expanding equitable access. Akello is working to operationalize Kisumu’s heat action plan by linking it to renewable energy adoption, appliance efficiency standards, and the development of agricultural cold chains, among other demand and supply dynamics within the county. “Kisumu has aligned its efforts with a county-wide 100% renewable energy roadmap running to 2050, with the aim to embed sustainable cooling into public investment decisions,” he stated.\nShifting to the question of finance, Rusmir Musić, Global Cooling Lead and Climate Finance Expert at the International Finance Corporation (IFC), addressed the challenge of building viable business cases in an underdeveloped investment landscape. He noted that cooling is not a standalone sector, but it’s embedded in housing, food systems, and health infrastructure, which is both a barrier and an opportunity. Musić went on to emphasise that bridging the finance gap requires translating the need for cooling into sector-specific investment strategies that resonate with private actors. “Unless we can make this about return on investment, showing that a developer, a logistics company, or a hospital system benefits financially, we won’t see the scale of finance that’s needed.” Musić highlighted IFC’s green housing work in India, where $340 million has already been deployed, and \nZonibel Woods, Senior Social Development Specialist at the Asian Development Bank, called on development leaders to take gender equality into account when tackling rising heat and increasing access to cooling, warning that climate solutions must work for everyone if they are to succeed. Women in informal work, agriculture, and caregiving roles are disproportionately affected by extreme heat, yet often overlooked in mainstream planning. Woods called for stronger data collection, intersectional analysis, and the adaptation of indigenous knowledge systems. “Some of the most effective strategies are low-cost, culturally rooted solutions that communities have used for generations,” she said. She also underscored the importance of Chief Heat Officers in bringing fragmented city departments into coordinated cross-sectoral responses.\nFrom a policy and technology standpoint, Guntram Glasbrenner, Programme Manager at GIZ Proklima, warned of the long-term risks of locking in inefficient, high-emissions cooling infrastructure. “We cannot afford another generation of cooling equipment with high global warming potential. R-32 is not the future,” he argued. Glasbrenner stressed the need to leapfrog to energy-efficient appliances using natural refrigerants, such as hydrocarbons, that already command over a third of the market. However, policy gaps remain. Regulatory enforcement, and cross-sector cooperation must all improve to accelerate the uptake of climate-friendly technologies. When working with hydrocarbons, continuous training of technicians is key. On this matter, Glasbrenner pointed to the \nThe Q&A session that followed reflected deep interest in the practical aspects of implementation. Participants raised questions about demand-side management strategies for ice machines in hospitality, how to disaggregate comfort cooling from cold chains, and the feasibility of integrating passive and active systems in underserved communities. Hartley responded that while data segmentation is possible, it would require a much higher level of granularity than is currently available. Sastry highlighted India’s current efforts to combine heat and cooling data into unified planning tools. Both Musić and Glasbrenner reinforced the importance of demonstrating financial returns through localized case studies as a way to convince both policymakers and investors.\nIn her closing reflections, Rosa Garcia emphasized the need to break down silos and build coherence across cooling, climate, and development strategies. “We’ve made progress in policy and technology,” she observed, “but the real test is whether we’re designing for the realities of the most vulnerable.”\nFind out more about the Chilling Prospects 2025 launch event, download the presentation, and watch the recording [here](https://coolcoalition.org/events/8548/)."

    "content": "Southeast Asian cities face unprecedented challenges from rising temperatures and intensifying urban heat island effects. In central Viet Nam, Tam Ky City, the administrative centre of Quang Nam Province, exemplifies the threat of extreme heat, with projections indicating the city’s cooling demand will rise by more than 30% by 2050, and heatwaves are expected to last more than seven times longer by the end of the century. Tam Ky is facing increasing pressure on public health, economic productivity and urban liveability. Against this backdrop, a vital workshop was convened to chart a transformative course for Tam Ky’s future.\nOn May 28, the Viet Nam Department for Climate Change (DCC) and the Quang Nam Department of Agriculture and Environment, supported by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in collaboration with the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) under the framework of the Cool Coalition, held a key consultation workshop. The gathering brought together 35 stakeholders from the DCC, local agencies, academia, and the private sector. As part of the “Sustainable Urban Cooling in Viet Nam Cities” project, this workshop aimed to finalise the Urban Cooling Action Plan (UCAP) for Tam Ky, prioritising key cooling initiatives. The event marked a critical milestone in the City’s journey toward sustainable urban development.\nThe UCAP, developed through collaboration between international and national experts from UNEP and GGGI, provides a comprehensive framework for addressing the city’s escalating urban heat challenges. The plan integrates innovative strategies at urban and building levels, including a heat-considerate urban geometry, cool roofs, urban ventilation, nature-based solutions, and climate-adaptive building design with optimal shading, high insulation, high performance windows, natural ventilation, passive cooling, and efficient cooling equipment. These tailored interventions reflect the unique urban structure and socio-economic realities of Tam Ky City and the Quang Nam Province, ensuring both immediate impact and long-term sustainability.\nThis workshop went beyond technical training, building capabilities and fostering collaboration. Participants actively discussed how to weave urban cooling solutions into local policies and city planning, underscoring the need for Tam Ky City’s efforts to align with Viet Nam’s national climate goals and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). By strengthening local knowledge and applying global best practices, the event showed the power of collective action.\nThe workshop delivered highly impactful and promising outcomes. Stakeholders reached consensus on the UCAP recommendations, setting the stage for formal approval by Quang Nam’s Department of Agriculture and Environment. Technical solutions and governance pathways were refined to ensure their feasibility and scalability, not just in Tam Ky City but also nationwide. Local insights, particularly from the Tam Ky City People’s Committee leadership, enriched the strategies, making them relevant to the city’s specific conditions.\nThe workshop is an excellent example of urban resilience to extreme heat in Viet Nam and across Asia. The experience of the city of Tam Ky, along with that of the city of Can Tho, will act as a model for other cities within the UNEP Cool Coalition’s regional initiative, demonstrating how sustainable cooling can reduce urban heat, while advancing national climate goals. Through bold collaboration and innovative thinking, the UNEP Cool Coalition and GGGI are supporting Tam Ky pioneer a cooler, greener, and more sustainable future. Tam Ky’s progress is therefore a crucial step not only for its own smart city ambitions, but also for climate resilience in urban centres around the world."

International collaboration remains the linchpin for moving from research and demonstration to mass-market deployment of solutions.\nAgainst this backdrop, the UNEP Cool Coalition participated in the \nThe Cool Coalition co-organized the high-level event [Cooling Commitments in Action – A High-Level Convening for Scalable Impact](https://coolcoalition.org/events/cooling-commitments-in-action-a-high-level-convening-for-scalable-impact-2/) together with the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), the International Energy Agency (IEA), and the Super-Efficient Equipment and Appliance Deployment (SEAD) initiative. The discussion examined how countries, industry, and international organizations can translate global commitments into results on the ground, with a focus on three themes: equity and affordability, the role of policy in creating predictable markets, and partnerships that de-risk investment and accelerate scale.\nModerator Jon Creyts, CEO of RMI, opened by framing the urgency of the cooling–climate feedback loop and the need to move from ambition to delivery. Rosalinde van der Vlies, Director for Just Transition, Consumers, Energy Efficiency and Innovation at the European Commission, stressed the importance of embedding cooling within efficiency frameworks and just-transition strategies to send clear signals to markets and consumers. Brian Dean, Director of Energy Transition at Sustainable Energy for All, emphasized that equity must remain central, with solutions designed to reach low-income households and vulnerable communities.\nFrom the Government of the United Kingdom, International Innovation Lead Melanie Jans-Singh underlined the role of pilots and cross-border collaboration in speeding the path from demonstration to deployment. National perspectives were reinforced by Arijit Sengupta, Director of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency at India’s Ministry of Power, who detailed how standards, codes, and programmatic interventions are being scaled to manage cooling demand sustainably.\nIndustry was represented by Takahiro Asahi, Manager of External Relations at Daikin Industries, who highlighted the responsibility and opportunity of manufacturers to bring high-efficiency HVAC solutions to market and avoid locking in emissions for decades.\nChloé Rosset, Partnerships Engagement Lead for the UNEP Cool Coalition, tied these strands together, underscoring that only through the convergence of policy, finance, and technology can pilots evolve into systemic impact.\nClosing reflections from Sungjin Oh, Policy Analyst at SEAD and IEA, echoed the urgency of collaboration, noting that solutions already exist, momentum is building, and collective effort can make sustainable cooling a shared global right.\nBeyond the high-level event, the Cool Coalition advanced its agenda through bilateral meetings with governments and partners. These discussions reinforced commitment to the [Global Cooling Pledge](https://coolcoalition.org/global-cooling-pledge/), the world’s first collective commitment to reducing cooling-related emissions by 68% by 2050, while also expanding equitable access to cooling. They also advanced coordination on [Beat the Heat in Cities](https://coolcoalition.org/pilot-projects/beat-the-heat-in-cities/), a new initiative co-developed with Brazil’s COP30 Presidency to mobilize urban action on extreme heat, and explored next steps for the Enabling Pledge Implementation for Cooling (EPIC) Facility, designed to provide targeted technical assistance and de-risk investment in Pledge signatory countries.\nThe Cool Coalition’s presence in Busan underscored that sustainable cooling is no longer a marginal issue but a development and resilience priority. With cooling demand expected to triple by mid-century and risks of extreme heat escalating, the path forward depends on aligning policy frameworks, finance, and technology to deliver solutions at scale. CEM16 showed that momentum is building and that through collaboration, sustainable cooling can become a global right rather than a privilege."

With cooling demand projected to rise by 34% by 2030 and heatwaves predicted to last six times longer by the end of the century, the stakes for climate resilience have never been higher. These escalating pressures threaten public health, economic productivity, and the very fabric of urban life. Against this backdrop, a vital workshop was convened to chart a transformative course for Can Tho’s future.\nOn 9 January 2025, the UNEP Cool Coalition and the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) hosted a landmark consultation workshop at the Muong Thanh Luxury Can Tho Hotel. The gathering brought together 38 stakeholders from the Viet Nam Department of Climate Change, local agencies, academia, and the private sector. As part of the “Sustainable Urban Cooling in Viet Nam Cities” project, this workshop aimed to finalize the Urban Cooling Action Plan (UCAP) for Can Tho and review a Pre-Feasibility Study for priority cooling initiatives. The event marked a critical milestone in Can Tho’s journey toward sustainable urban development.\nThe UCAP, developed through collaboration between international and local experts, provides a comprehensive framework for addressing the city’s pressing urban heat challenges. It combines cutting-edge strategies like increasing shaded areas by urban vegetation and geometry, optimizing urban natural ventilation, and adopting passive cooling and energy-efficient designs at both urban and building levels, such as reflective roofs, heat-proof building envelopes, well-ventilated floor plans, and spatial layouts. These tailored interventions consider the unique urban structure and socio-economic realities of Can Tho, ensuring both immediate impact and long-term sustainability.\nThe Pre-Feasibility Study, another of the workshop, evaluated key projects such as the New Urban Area and Centralized IT Park, emphasizing innovative solutions like shaded streets and passive building designs. These efforts are designed not only to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also to lower energy consumption, creating a cooler and more urban environment.\nMore than a technical exercise, the workshop was a platform for capacity-building and collaboration. Participants engaged in dynamic discussions on integrating urban cooling solutions into local policies and urban planning frameworks. These exchanges highlighted the importance of aligning Can Tho’s efforts with Viet Nam’s broader climate commitments and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 11 on sustainable cities and Goal 13 on climate action. By fostering local expertise and harnessing global best practices, the event underscored the transformative potential of collective action.\nThe outcomes of the workshop were as significant as they were promising. Stakeholders reached consensus on the recommendations outlined in the UCAP, paving the way for formal approval by Can Tho’s Department of Natural Resources and Environment. Technical solutions and governance pathways were refined to ensure their feasibility and scalability, not just in Can Tho but across other cities in Viet Nam. Local insights, particularly from Can Tho University and community leaders, enriched the proposed strategies, grounding them in the realities of the city’s unique context.\nThis workshop represents a model for urban resilience across Viet Nam and Asia as a whole. As part of the UNEP Cool Coalition’s broader initiative in the region, Can Tho’s experience will serve as a blueprint for other cities, including Tam Ky, demonstrating how sustainable cooling can mitigate urban heat while advancing national climate goals. The lessons learned here offer invaluable insights into how cities can address the urgent challenges of rising temperatures and growing energy demands, paving the way for scalable solutions that benefit communities far beyond Viet Nam.\nThrough bold collaboration and innovative thinking, the UNEP Cool Coalition and GGGI are helping Can Tho lead the charge toward a cooler, greener, and more sustainable future. That way, a step forward for one city, is a leap toward climate resilience for urban worldwide.\nFor further details, visit:"

    "content": "As global temperatures continue to rise and extreme heat events intensify, the demand for space cooling in homes, offices, schools, and healthcare facilities is soaring. Without a transition to sustainable solutions, this growing demand risks escalating emissions and overloading already strained energy systems.\nOn 20 March 2025, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (GlobalABC), and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Cool Coalition co-hosted [Cooler Finance: Sustainable Space Cooling for All](https://coolcoalition.org/events/cooler-finance-sustainable-space-cooling-for-all/), a webinar focused on the findings from the joint IFC–UNEP Cool Coalition report \n##### **Finance Meets Climate Action**\nCool Coalition Global Coordinator Lily Riahi welcomed participants and set the stage by framing cooling as a critical lever for both climate mitigation and adaptation. She emphasized that improved financing mechanisms are integral to the [Global Cooling Pledge](https://coolcoalition.org/global-cooling-pledge/), reminding attendees that “Cooler finance is a defining issue, as each year brings higher greenhouse gas emissions and more extreme heat, leaving vulnerable communities struggling to survive.”\nThe Global Cooling Pledge, launched at the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28), and co-chaired by the United Arab Emirates and Brazil, now counts over 70 government Signatories and 80 non-state supporters committed to cutting cooling-related emissions by over 60% by 2050. Anchored in the science-based date provided in the \nIn his opening remarks, Jonathan Duwyn, Programme Management Officer at GlobalABC, noted how sustainable cooling intersects with the buildings and construction agenda, particularly in terms of “passive-first” design approaches. “We must come back to solutions rooted in local climates—construction techniques, technologies, and design that can limit the need for mechanical cooling,” he said. Duwyn highlighted the \nPassive cooling principles include thoughtful building orientation, natural ventilation, shading, improved insulation, and nature-based approaches to mitigating urban heat. These strategies prove particularly vital in lower-income contexts, where high upfront costs for mechanical cooling can be prohibitive.\nOpening the webinar from the finance perspective, Diep Nguyen-Van Houtte, Senior Manager for Innovation and Business Development at the IFC, underscored how building-focused interventions can drive large-scale impact, given that most human activity takes place indoors. “Almost everything we humans do happens in buildings,” she said. “That’s why cooling for green buildings is one of the five pillars of \n##### **From Passive Strategies to Real-World Innovation**\nMoving to presentations, Gennai Kamata, Associate Programme Officer at UNEP, drew from the Cooler Finance and Global Cooling Watch reports to highlight how passive solutions can cut cooling demand by up to 24% by 2050, saving an estimated $3 trillion in equipment costs and avoiding 1.3 billion tons of CO₂ emissions. “Passive cooling is not new—it’s cost-effective, low-tech, and already available. What’s missing is awareness and integration into design,” he noted. Kamata stressed that although active cooling currently dominates the market, passive approaches represent a cost-effective, low-hanging opportunity, particularly in low-income settings where affordability and resilience are key. He showcased the Cool Coalition’s work in Cambodia to demonstrate cool roof technologies and the development of a Passive Cooling Companion Guide to support national policy integration. He also emphasized the value of tools like IFC’s EDGE platform in helping architects and developers assess return on investment and long-term energy savings.\nFor the second presentation of the session, Bolivar Monroy, Technical Director at ACAIRE, showcased real-world applications in space cooling from recent high-performance building projects across Latin America and beyond. Monroy revealed that while inefficient cooling systems account for massive energy losses globally, solutions already exist to enable market transformation—particularly through advanced Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, smart building automation, thermal energy storage, and low Global Warming Potential (GWP) refrigerants. “The good news is that we have the technology to make this transformation possible,” he said, pointing to examples from Singapore and New York that integrated artificial intelligence and retrofit strategies to drastically cut emissions and operational costs. He also highlighted the role of magnetic bearing chillers, hybrid passive-active designs, and smart controls in achieving up to 65% energy savings. Monroy closed with a call to action: assess current building performance, leverage financial incentives, and adopt future-ready cooling technologies to ensure long-term sustainability.\n##### **Collaboration for Implementation**\nThe Q&A session was moderated by Rusmir Musić, Global Cooling Lead at IFC, who also showcased IFC EDGE tool’s capacity for measuring both capital expenses and operational cost savings—ultimately strengthening the business case for green buildings. “Implementing efficiency at the design stage is cheaper than retrofitting later,” he noted, “especially in rapidly urbanizing regions like Africa and Asia.” In response to concerns around cost recovery, Musić pointed to faster sales and greater access to green finance as compelling incentives. He also underscored the importance of early collaboration between architects and engineers and encouraged governments to adopt non-fiscal policy measures like expedited permitting to accelerate sustainable cooling adoption.\nRounding up discussions, Gennai Kamata delivered the closing remarks by inviting participants to join the [Cool Coalition Passive Cooling Working Group](https://coolcoalition.org/about/what-we-do/passive-cooling/#:~:text=Key%20principles%20of%20passive%20cooling,and%20use%20of%20nature%2Dbased), which he co-chairs. The group convenes like-minded countries and organizations to support policymakers and stakeholders in the building sector through the development of policy toolkits, advocacy, matchmaking, technical guidance, awareness-raising, and capacity-building efforts to accelerate passive cooling adoption. Kamata highlighted ongoing discussions within the group on evaporative cooling and nature-based solutions, emphasizing their applicability in both dry and humid climates. Finally, Kamata announced plans to develop Passive Cooling Guidelines in the lead-up to COP30, which will offer detailed policy recommendations and technical pathways for scaling passive strategies.\nFind out more about the webinar and watch the full recording Register for the next Cool Talk on cooling-as-a-service [here](https://coolcoalition.org/events/7988/).

    "title": "Morocco Launches National Cooling Action Plan with Strong Institutional Support",
    "content": "Morocco has officially launched the development of its National Cooling Action Plan (NCAP), setting a national course to deliver sustainable, equitable and climate-resilient cooling solutions. The initiative is implemented by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Cool Coalition and the Regional Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (RCREEE), with support from the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC).\nA two-day programme in Rabat brought together key ministries, national agencies, technical experts, and stakeholders across the cooling sector. The meetings marked both the NCAP’s launch and the inaugural session of its National Steering Committee.\nThe NCAP responds to Morocco’s rising cooling needs across sectors such as health, food, and buildings, amid increasing temperatures, rapid urbanisation, and economic development. As part of the Cool Coalition’s global NCAP programme, it will define specific policy and investment pathways tailored to the national context.\nSenior officials delivered remarks, including Myriem Touhami, Head of the Finance Unit at UNEP’s Climate Change Division; Hafsa Lakhlifi, Director of Circular Economy and Pollution Control at the Minamata Convention on Mercury; Hind Abdaoui, Head of Service in Renewable Energies and Energy Efficiency at Morocco’s Ministry of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development; and Abdelali Dakkina, Morocco’s CCAC National Coordinator. Each underscored Morocco’s commitment to integrating cooling into national sustainable development and climate priorities.\nParticipants examined the national workplan for Morocco’s NCAP and discussed the structure and mandate of the Steering Committee. The consultant team presented the modelling approaches that will inform technical assessments of current and future cooling demand, alongside a roadmap for comprehensive data collection across key sectors and a timeline for next steps.\nThe following day, the Steering Committee convened at the Ministry of Energy Transition to establish the NCAP’s governance and coordination framework. Members discussed institutional roles, data strategies, cross-sectoral engagement, and decision-making structures to ensure the NCAP aligns with both domestic policy goals and international commitments such as the Kigali Amendment and the Global Cooling Pledge. The consultants presented their approaches to modelling current and future cooling needs under different policy scenarios, while the committee provided guidance on ensuring the methodology reflects national realities.\nIndustry engagement formed another important dimension of the launch. UNEP and RCREEE visited key actors in Morocco’s cooling landscape: the Moroccan Association of Refrigeration Professionals (AMPF), which plays a central role in promoting sustainable practices and innovation in the sector; Ventec Maroc, which has operated in Morocco since 1949 and became the exclusive Carrier representative in 1960; and Froidel, a Moroccan company with more than four decades of experience in industrial and commercial refrigeration.\nMorocco’s NCAP is part of a broader global movement. Forty-two countries are currently developing or implementing NCAPs as part of the Global Cooling Pledge, the world’s first collective commitment to reduce cooling-related emissions by more than 60 percent by 2050, while expanding access to life-saving cooling services.\nWith the next round of Nationally Determined Contributions due in 2025 and the 2025 UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) approaching, Morocco’s efforts come at a critical time. The NCAP will help integrate sustainable cooling into national planning, ensuring that policies meet the needs of communities already feeling the impacts of extreme heat. The groundwork laid in Rabat, from strong institutional governance to private sector engagement, signals Morocco’s determination to shape a cooler, more resilient future."

    "content": "In Cambodia, demand for space cooling is set to double in the next 20 years. Passive cooling solutions can help optimize buildings performance, reduce the need for active cooling, and expand access to thermal comfort.\nWHY PASSIVE COOLING IN CAMBODIA?\nSoutheast Asia is experiencing significant urbanization, economic and population growth. Without intervention, these factors and a warming climate will lead energy consumption for comfort cooling and related emissions to increase exponentially.\nAccording to the 2021 Cambodia National Cooling Action Plan, demand for space cooling is set to double between 2020-2040 to 3.7 million tons of refrigeration in Cambodia. Buildings are responsible for one third of the total final energy consumption in Cambodia. With a hot- humid climate, energy demand for space cooling accounts for the largest portion of electricity use in buildings’ operation.\nAction to reduce the need for mechanical cooling is critical to avoid emissions, as well as the negative impacts of the growing use of cooling appliances on the energy grid. Extensive national government and expert consultations, including during Cambodia’s National Cooling Action Plan development, have pointed to the need for greater municipal intervention on cooling and extreme heat.\nIntegrating passive cooling solutions (PCS) in national building laws and urban strategies will optimize buildings performance, maximize mitigation and climate benefits from efficient, climate-friendly cooling, and deliver cooling services to ensure thermal comfort to users.\nABOUT THE PROJECT\nIn consultation with the Ministry of Environment of Cambodia, the project will pursue impactful measures to reduce cooling demand in buildings and cities, with a focus on Passive Cooling Solutions (PCS) and mitigation of the Urban Heat Island Effect (UHIE).\nThe project will include:\n  * Policy interventions through the inclusion of PCS in building energy regulations.\n  * Demonstrate passive cooling applications in buildings.\n  * Deliver awareness raising and capacity building for large scale replication.\n  * Support the inclusion of GHG emission reductions from PCS in the next cycle target for Cambodia’s NDC.\n\n\nThe project is co-led by the Cool Coalition Secretariat and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and funded by the Clean Cooling Collaborative (CCC).\nWHAT WILL THE PROJECT DO\nPolicy Guidelines\nThe project will develop Design Guidelines for Passive Cooling of Buildings in Cambodia based on technical analysis of prevalent building typologies and climatic zones of the country. It will define provisions for minimum performance requirements for PCS, which can be included in building regulations under development and green building guidelines.\nTechnology Mapping\nThe project will compile a compendium of applicable and available passive cooling solutions in the country and region. This tool will support building sector stakeholders to understand PCS technologies, their technical specifications, case studies, details of country/regional vendors and cost information.\nDemonstration in Buildings\nThe project will provide technical support for the design and implementation of effective PCS integration in building projects. These buildings will become light house projects to illustrate the use of PCS to achieve ultra-low energy and low cooling buildings in the country. The project will analyse the UHIE around the demonstration projects and propose recommendations for mitigation and resilience enhancement.\nAwareness Raising\nThe project will raise awareness on integrated design process and simulations on energy consumption to reduce cooling demand in new and existing buildings through PCS integration. Key activities include an awareness raising campaign, a regional workshop and technical knowledge dissemination programs.\nESTIMATED IMPACT\nPassive cooling solutions are considered a priority by building sector stakeholders, and preferred options to relying on active cooling systems.\n2% of the existing building stock (residential and commercial) are retrofitted with PCS and 20% of the upcoming building stock includes PCS.\nUnlock saving potential of 10% – 20% through integration of PCS in retrofits or new buildings compared to conventional energy performance of similar standard buildings.\nPerformance requirements for cool roof and envelope are integrated into new building energy regulation resulting in an increase on the uptake of these solutions.\nPCS policies and adopted practices are adequately accounted and monitored in the GHG inventory and contribute to the achievement of the NDC commitments.\nBased on estimates, the project implementation would contribute cumulatively around 0.5 MtCO2eq reduction by 2030.\nCOMPRENDIUM FOR PASSIVE COOLING STRATEGIES IN CAMBODIA\nThe [Compendium for Passive Cooling Strategies in Cambodia](https://coolcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Compendium-for-Passive-Cooling-Strategies-in-Cambodia.pdf) serves as a practical guide for integrating passive cooling strategies into Cambodia’s building sector. Tailored for architects, engineers, building owners, and professionals in construction and maintenance, it highlights three key types of strategies: site-oriented, design-oriented, and material/technology-oriented measures. Each section offers clear technical insights, practical application steps, and helpful tools to assist in selecting the most effective passive cooling options for projects. Beyond the core strategies, the compendium also includes a material directory and international case studies, providing additional support for the successful adoption of these solutions.\nThe Compendium was developed and published by the Ministry of Environment of Cambodia. This work was made possible through the technical and financial support of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Cool Coalition, and the ClimateWorks Foundation, whose contributions were crucial to its development.\nFOR MORE INFORMATION\nTo support the project or to be kept informed on its development please contact us"

The way we design, retrofit, and regulate buildings will determine whether we stay on course to meet climate targets or fall behind. As heat extremes intensify, so does the urgency to ensure that communities everywhere have access to solutions that are sustainable, efficient, and equitable.\n#### **One Pavilion, Two Priorities**\nAt COP30, the UNEP Cool Coalition and the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (GlobalABC) will co-host the [Buildings and Cooling Pavilion](https://coolcoalition.org/cop30-buildings-and-cooling-pavilion/), continuing a joint effort that began in Dubai and has gained momentum through each successive COP.\nPositioned in the Blue Zone, the Buildings and Cooling Pavilion will serve as a space for exchange, solutions, and ambition. It will unite voices from across the built environment and cooling sectors, from national governments and international agencies to city leaders, startups, engineers, and financiers. The Pavilion will highlight how buildings and cooling intersect across mitigation, adaptation, and development priorities in the global climate agenda. The Pavilion has been officially endorsed by Brazil’s Ministry of Cities, further underscoring the host country’s commitment to integrating sustainable buildings and cooling into national and subnational climate action.\nThis year’s theme, “Creating Resilient Communities with Better Buildings, Sustainable Cooling, and Smarter Materials,” reflects the Pavilion’s central message: that how we construct and cool our world is fundamental to how we survive and thrive on an increasingly warming planet.\n#### **What to Expect in Belém**\nThe Buildings and Cooling Pavilion brings together two powerful agendas:\n  * building decarbonisation, championed by GlobalABC, through net-zero strategies, materials innovation, policy alignment, and investment pathways; and\n  * sustainable cooling, advanced by the Cool Coalition, through access, efficiency, refrigerant transition, and systems-level integration.\n\n\nTogether, they form a platform for solutions that cut across mitigation, adaptation, and resilience.\nThe Pavilion will host an ambitious programme of high-level dialogues, technical sessions, interactive exhibits, and key announcements, including the launch of flagship publications and new partnerships designed to accelerate national implementation.\nParticipants or members of GlobalABC/Cool Coalition can now:\n  * Become a sponsor.\n\n\nInterested stakeholders can  to engage in the Pavilion and other strategic opportunities.\nPlease note that you will receive feedback on your session proposal from mid-July 2025 onwards. The GlobalABC and Cool Coalition will review all submissions and may propose adjustments regarding session date and time allocation, partner organizations, or the consolidation of similar proposals based on thematic alignment.\nJoin a space where global priorities meet practical solutions, and where partnerships turn into progress! Deadline for submissions is 30 June 2025. For more information on sponsorship packages please contact \n#### **Why This COP Matters More Than Ever**\nThe choice of Belém, right on the edge of one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable regions, sends a clear message. The Amazon is a tipping point not just ecologically, but symbolically. COP30 is expected to set a new tone for international ambition and cooperation, especially on issues like sustainable cooling that cut across sectors, geographies, and equity lines.\nThe recent appointment of Dan Ioschpe as Brazil’s Climate High-Level Champion reinforces the COP30 Presidency’s commitment to bringing industrial leadership into the climate conversation. As Chairman of the Board of Iochspe-Maxion, and a key figure across Brazil’s manufacturing and business networks, Ioschpe’s involvement is aimed at bridging technical policy with real-world implementation.\nThis comes at a critical moment, as countries prepare the third iteration of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs 3.0). With sustainable cooling increasingly recognized as both a mitigation and adaptation strategy, the Pavilion aims to help mainstream it across national and subnational climate planning, as well as to elevate how the built environment is integrated into climate plans and investment strategies.\nMeanwhile, the GlobalABC continues to drive the buildings agenda forward through the \nThe Cool Coalition is advancing global action on cooling through the [Global Cooling Pledge](https://coolcoalition.org/global-cooling-pledge/), which now includes commitments from 72 countries to reduce cooling-related emissions by 68% by 2050.

    "content": "Haryana is traditionally an agrarian society of owner-based cultivator farmers. Over half the state’s population is engaged directly or indirectly in agriculture, and about 86% of its land is arable, of which 96% is cultivated. Haryana contributes a significant 14.1% to India’s agricultural GDP, producing key horticulture crops such as potatoes, tomatoes, onions, cauliflower, citrus fruits, mangoes, and guavas.\nYet, despite this production strength, Haryana’s potential is stifled by missing links in integrated cold-chain infrastructure. Most farmers in the state are small or marginal holders dependent on daily sales. With limited access to precondition, precool and move their produce, many lose out due to post-harvest losses—estimated at 15% for fruits and 11% for vegetables. According to the National Centre for Cold-Chain Development (NCCD) Study, Haryana needs nearly 1695 packhouses, yet as of 2022, only 33 approx. existed.\nRecognizing this gap, the Government of Haryana with JICA support has set ambitious targets with investment of Rs. 2700 crore (USD 320 Mill approx.) to scale up to 500+ integrated packhouses by 2033 across the state and connecting fresh produce to distant domestic and export markets.\nTo accelerate this effort, the Department of Horticulture, Haryana, and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) have signed a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on their action-focused partnership to address gaps in horticulture cold-chain infrastructure in the state through its first cold chain policy, reduced food loss and emissions, rapidly increasing energy demand for cold-chain for horticulture and associated refrigerant consumption while supporting rural communities and farmers in increasing their livelihoods. The MoU builds on UNEP’s ongoing work through the “Scaling-up Investment in Clean and Efficient Cold Chain in India” project under the UNEP Cool Coalition and delivered with Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy (AEEE) as lead partner, and the Haryana-UK Centre of Excellence on Sustainable Crop Post-Harvest Management and Cold-Chain (CoE-SPMCC), which are complementary initiatives focused on accelerating differing aspects of sustainable cold chain development in India, with Haryana as a key priority state.\nPriorities include development of integrated cold-chain facilities with market connectivity in Haryana, facilitate access to financing through state and central schemes, support Farmer Producer Organizations with first-mile packhouses, support energy-efficient and renewable energy-based technologies, skilling and capacity building for farmers and businesses, and beyond.\n“There is both an economic and climate cost to inefficient cold chains,” says Balakrishna Pisupati, UNEP India Country Head. “UNEP brings global expertise, technical assistance, policy support, and innovative finance and business models to support Haryana in building cold chain systems that are both climate-friendly and economically viable. Expanding sustainable cold chains is necessary to meet several Sustainable Development Goals related to poverty reduction, food security, good health, and climate action. We’re looking at a future where even small farmers and Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) with State support can access clean, energy-efficient cold chain facilities without bearing unreasonable costs.”\n“For Haryana, developing an organized, sustainable cold chain is essential, not just for reducing post-harvest losses but for securing better incomes and market access for our farmers,” says Dr. Arjun Singh Saini, Head of Department (Special), Horticulture, Haryana. “This partnership with UNEP is about enabling farmers to adopt modern technologies, access new markets, and benefit from sustainable, climate-friendly practices. By strengthening our horticulture value chain, we aim to create long-term livelihood benefits for Haryana’s farmers while contributing to India’s broader climate and development goals.”\nEchoing this, Shri Pankaj Aggarwal, IAS, Principal Secretary, Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Haryana, adds: “For Haryana, an efficient cold chain is not just about storage; it’s about efficiently moving fresh produce to markets and protecting the value of our farmers’ produce and ensuring stability in their livelihoods. Most of our farmers are smallholders who need reliable, accessible facilities like packhouses near their farms. Through this collaboration with UNEP, Haryana is working to build a modern, inclusive cold chain ecosystem that addresses climate challenges while strengthening rural incomes and setting an example for other states.”\nThe MoU signing was followed by a workshop on sustainable cold chain solutions and implementation, bringing together key partners. Attended by technical officials from the horticulture departments of Haryana and Punjab, as well as cold-chain business owners, the workshop featured technical sessions on revised NCCD guidelines-2025, packhouse design and technology, post-harvest management, and best practices for energy-efficient horticulture cold chains.\nBy aligning UNEP and partners’ cold chain expertise with Haryana’s state-level priorities, the MOU facilitates a collaborative platform for technical support, policy development, financial facilitation, and capacity building. It moves beyond fragmented efforts towards system-wide transformation, positioning Haryana as a national demonstration site following a systems approach for how organized, sustainable cold chains can simultaneously boost farmer incomes, reduce food loss, and contribute to India’s climate action goals."

    "content": "UNEP Cool Coalition has developed a long-term, multi-ministry, multi-partner India Cooling Programme to support the implementation of the India Cooling Action Plan, the Doubling Farmers’ Income report recommendations and India’s path towards a net-zero and climate-resilient economy. The programme supports urban heat adaptation and sustainable cooling through passive cooling with sustainable building materials, heat-resilient urban design with nature, sustainable cold chains for food system resilience, and accelerating the market for district cooling.\nThe programme collaborates with six central government ministries, five national institutions, and seven state governments reaching over 600 million people in over 20 cities. It also directly engages the private sector, academia and civil society institutions -many of them active Cool Coalition members – to accelerate action on the ground.\nBeCool Programme\nIndia has the world’s largest population at risk from extreme heat, with wide-ranging impacts on health, productivity and the economy. While air conditioning provides indoor relief, it remains unaffordable for millions—and will likely remain so for decades. Poorly designed buildings and rising urban heat islands mean that even households with AC often face stark budget choices between high electricity bills to keep cool and other household priorities like education and healthcare. Conventional air conditioning is also highly energy-intensive, worsens the climate crisis, can trigger dangerous power outages during heatwaves, and expels heat directly onto streets, exacerbating urban hotspots.\nPassive cooling measures can address these challenges if implemented on a large-scale – both in buildings and at the urban-level. Buildings can remain naturally cooler for longer durations through design features like shading, cross-ventilation, cool or green roofs, insulation and thermal mass, and heat resilient glazing. At the urban level, passive cooling can reduce urban heat island effect (UHIE) and provide much needed outdoor thermal comfort for the most vulnerable through increased green and blue infrastructure, reduced hard, heat-absorbing surfaces, increased reflectivity of roofs and surfaces, shading and urban layouts that allow cool breezes to flow through the city.\nThe BeCool project, supported by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), aims to rapidly accelerate uptake of passive cooling across India’s built environment making it more sustainably and affordably cooled and more resilient to rising extreme heat. This will help greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by cooling buildings are avoided to mitigate adverse effects on the climate, power systems, health, environment, and economy.\nBeCool is working to:\n  * Strengthen, design and implement policies at central and state level for passive cooling and thermal comfort, both indoors and outdoors\n  * Accelerate public and private sector funding and financing of passively cooled buildings and cities,\n  * Train and handhold private real estate developers and building designers for accelerated uptake of passive cooling\n\n\nThe project is working with central government ministries and institutions as well as with Delhi, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh.\nCOLD CHAIN\nIn the heat-stricken region of Bihar, India, farmers are watching their livelihoods wither. As extreme heat intensifies, perishable vegetables are spoiling within hours of harvest, leading to massive crop losses, income instability, and rising food insecurity. In this short film, farmers and farmer union leaders reveal how the absence of reliable packhouses and cold storage is compounding the climate crisis on the ground.\nAgriculture supports 44% of India’s population and contributes nearly 20% to its GDP. Yet only 4% of the country’s produce benefits from cold chain, leading to high levels of food loss and associated methane emissions, lower farmer incomes, and missed domestic market linkage and export opportunities. Integrated cold chain infrastructure is vital for preserving food quality, extending marketable life of fresh produce, reducing emissions, and strengthening food and nutritional security. Scaling clean, efficient cold chains is essential, but challenges remain, including limited policy access, low awareness among relevant stakeholders on clean technologies and available public support, lack of financial support, technical capacity and participatory business models.\nUNEP Cool Coalition has established a National Cold-Chain Support Programme to accelerate the deployment of sustainable and integrated cold chain systems in India and support the implementation of ICAP and the achievement of the national target of Doubling Farmers Income. This objective is to mainstream efficient, renewable, climate-friendly cold-chain infrastructure and services for horticulture in rural areas. This project is being delivered in partnership with Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy (AEEE).\nWHAT WILL THE PROJECT DO\nInnovative Technology\nThe demonstration project will consist of a net-zero carbon, net-zero water use, zero waste and a net energy surplus cold chain packhouse based on circular economy principles that can contribute to a more resilient local power grid.\nThe packhouse will be assessed alongside potential new rural livelihood initiatives such as agrivoltaics, mushroom cultivation and aquaponics and promote important agricultural innovations in a drought-threatened area, such as precision irrigation.\nPeople Centred\nThe project will create new job opportunities and include capacity building, participatory, equitable and dignified employment and remuneration system. The project will upgrade existing skill sets (agricultural, administrative, marketing etc.) of employees and offer skill development training to the community. The project will be built with, and within, the community, which will directly benefit from the activities.\nFrom food to vaccines\nThe project will explore possibilities to extend the cold infrastructure for other end uses like vaccine storage, access to refrigeration for local workers and a cooled village community centre.\nBusiness Model\nThe project will be developed to demonstrate commercial viability and showcase a sustainable and circular model to deliver high-quality cold chain services that boost farmer incomes and strengthen livelihoods of the rural community.\nThe business model will be designed to be replicable and scalable under a participatory model with farmers and Farmers Producer Organizations (FPOs).\nFOR MORE INFORMATION\nYou can download the project’s flyer [at this link](https://coolcoalition.org/download/cold-chain-india-project/). To find out more and register your organisation’s interest in this program, please email \nDistrict Cooling and Cooling as a Service (CaaS)\nAccording to ICAP, space cooling demand in India could rise 14-fold by 2037-38 compared to 2017 levels. By 2050, cooling could account for 28% of total electricity demand and 44% of peak load as projected by the International Energy Agency. Demand for space cooling will be concentrated in India’s rapidly growing cities, leading to power shortages and rising urban temperatures.\nSince 2016, UNEP has been working with the Government of India to accelerate the adoption of district cooling – the most energy efficient, low-carbon and cost-effective means to provide cooling to buildings in dense, urban areas. District cooling can deliver cost-effective refrigerant phase-down, significant reductions in peak power demand and lower the urban heat island effect. District cooling and Cooling as a Service business models are growing rapidly in India with several projects already developed."

    "content": "As the global community prepares for the 2025 \nOn 22 July 2025, the UNEP-convened Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (GlobalABC) and Cool Coalition co-hosted the second session of their [COP30 Buildings and Cooling Pavilion](https://coolcoalition.org/cop30-buildings-and-cooling-pavilion/) Webinar Series, titled “Sustainable Construction in Brazil: Bio-based Materials for a Living Amazon.” The session brought together experts across architecture, procurement, and ecosystem resilience to discuss how regenerative, locally rooted solutions can support both people and the planet.\nModerated by GlobalABC Communications Specialist Antara Islam, the event framed the built environment as both a climate challenge and an opportunity for systemic transformation. Islam anchored the discussion in the context of the COP30 Action Agenda and emphasized the importance of elevating Brazil’s leadership in nature-based construction as a global example.\nOpening remarks were delivered by Mona Abdulghani Naji Mohammed, Programme Officer at UNEP’s Cities Unit, who underscored the rising emissions from building materials and the urgent need to promote circularity and bio-based alternatives. She introduced UNEP’s \nMirey Atallah, Head of the Nature for Climate Branch at UNEP, delivered a keynote that challenged siloed thinking between climate and biodiversity. She called for a paradigm shift that centres forests as assets in the climate fight: “If we don’t give forests an economic value, we make them vulnerable,” she said, arguing that forest-based materials like sustainably sourced timber can provide both livelihood and conservation benefits. Atallah also advocated for public policies that integrate social justice and ecological sustainability.\nPaul King, CEO of Built by Nature, introduced the \nTurning to public procurement, Silvana Loayza Leon, Sustainable Built Environment Consultant at One Planet, presented One Planet’s \nBringing the conversation to the ground level, Noelia Monteiro, Director of Estudio Flume, shared insights from three architectural projects developed with forest-dwelling communities in the Brazilian Amazon. Working closely with the traditional Povo Jupaú, Monteiro emphasized participatory design, local knowledge systems, and bio-based materials, such as açaí fiber and bamboo. “These buildings are co-created. They reflect not only climate realities but cultural identity,” she said, urging donors and regulators to make space for non-conventional design processes.\nLuis Ignacio Faria da Silva, Coordinator of the Architecture and Biosphere Research Group at Escola da Cidade, expanded on how architectural pedagogy in Brazil is evolving to support socio-ecological regeneration. He presented the Floresta project, developed with the Jupaú community, as a model of how architecture can serve as a bridge between ancestral knowledge and sustainable design. “This isn’t about importing models. It’s about rediscovering what is already there,” he said.\nThe Q&A session included questions ranging from sourcing sustainable materials in remote regions to financing indigenous-led construction and integrating circularity into national procurement laws. Throughout the discussion, speakers repeatedly emphasized the need for system-wide coordination, from community participation to public investment and architectural education.\nThe webinar was part of the official run-up to the COP30 Buildings and Cooling Pavilion, which will be hosted in the Blue Zone from 10 to 21 November 2025. Submissions for sessions closed in July, with nearly 200 proposals received. A joint GlobalABC and Cool Coalition selection committee is currently reviewing submissions to announce the programme in autumn.\nWatch the recording"

    "title": "Viet Nam’s Urban Cooling Milestone",
    "content": "Extreme heat is intensifying across the globe, but in Southeast Asia, the collision of rapid urbanisation and high humidity has turned heat stress into a daily systemic challenge. In Viet Nam, urban heat islands are already pushing land surface temperatures in city centres up to 5°C higher than surrounding areas. This urban overheating trend carries deep implications for public health, energy demand, and economic resilience.\nAgainst this backdrop, Viet Nam’s Department of Climate Change (DCC) under the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Cool Coalition, and the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) concluded a multi-year partnership with the release of a new Urban Cooling Action Plan (UCAP) package for pilot cities. The culmination of this work was marked by a national event in Hanoi on 28 August 2025, attended by nearly 100 participants from ministries, local governments, technical institutions, and the financial sector. The event served as a bridge between policy and practice, reinforcing Viet Nam’s climate ambitions, while laying the groundwork for scalable, investment-ready cooling solutions.\n#### **Translating plans into city practice**\nDeputy Director Lê Ngọc Tuấn of the DCC opened the session, positioning urban cooling within Viet Nam’s evolving climate policy framework, and noting the country’s strong commitment alongside the international community.\nViet Nam joined the [Global Cooling Pledge](https://coolcoalition.org/global-cooling-pledge/) in 2023 with a target to reduce cooling-related emissions by at least 68% by 2050 (against 2022 levels), and has since introduced key policies to enable this transition. In 2024, the Prime Minister issued a National Plan on managing and phasing out ozone-depleting substances and controlled greenhouse gases (Decision 496/QĐ-TTg), which set priorities like raising minimum energy performance standards for cooling equipment and promoting climate-friendly refrigerants. Most notably, 2025 marked the first time the concept of sustainable cooling was institutionalized in Viet Nam’s regulations through a new government decree that paves the way for long-term cooling strategies.\nIn the same opening session, Benjamin Hickman, UNEP Cool Coalition Senior Programme Manager, spoke on the critical role cities will play in delivering on Viet Nam’s cooling commitments under the Global Cooling Pledge. He warned of the current vicious cycle in which inefficient cooling devices consume excessive energy and exacerbate urban heat, stressing that access to cooling is now an essential public need rather than a luxury.\nBringing the investment lens, Maria Cecilia Pana, Deputy Country Representative at GGGI Viet Nam, underscored the importance of risk mitigation and cross-sector partnerships to accelerate the transition from planning to bankability.\nFrom the national to the local level, Nguyen Dang Thu Cuc, Deputy Head of the Greenhouse Gas Emission Management and Ozone Layer Protection Division at DCC, shared regulatory progress in incorporating sustainable cooling across sectors–from building design and urban planning to health and ozone protection programs.\nMeanwhile, Manjeet Singh, Senior Project Specialist at the UNEP Cool Coalition, outlined the outcomes of the DCC–UNEP–GGGI partnership, drawing out technical and institutional lessons that can inform a national scale-up.\nThe event’s technical sessions drew upon insights from the pilot cities, showcasing practical applications of urban cooling strategies at the local level. UNEP Senior Technical Experts Zhuolun Chen and Ngo Hoang Ngoc Dung presented insights from the UCAP pilots in Can Tho and Tam Ky, demonstrating how data-driven urban design interventions can mitigate extreme heat. They recommended measures such as passive cooling through urban greenery and natural ventilation, reflective “cool” roofing, and high-efficiency cooling systems to reduce heat exposure, while cutting emissions. These city case studies illustrated that combining passive strategies (like urban trees, water features, and airflow-oriented design) with efficient cooling technologies can help cities adapt to rising temperatures without driving up emissions.\nCity representatives then offered practical reflections on translating plans into action. Nguyen Thi Thuy Nhi, Deputy Director of the Can Tho Department of Agriculture and Environment (DAE), explained how UCAP guidance is already shaping development planning. Nguyen Hoang Yen of Da Nang DAE explained how UCAP recommendations are being woven into new projects, even as administrative boundaries evolve. She noted that a pilot concept initially developed for Tam Ky’s Phu Binh area is now being implemented in Quang Phu Ward, an area recently incorporated into Da Nang.\n#### **Laying the groundwork for investment**\nSustainable cooling is not just a climate and health imperative, but also a significant economic opportunity. The cooling market in developing economies is already valued at roughly 300 billion USD and is expected to double by 2050, opening major opportunities to mobilize green finance.\nThe final workshop session connected solutions to finance, with UNEP Technical Advisor Trinh Quoc Dung introducing a shortlist of cooling projects in Can Tho and Tam Ky now ready for investment, notably the New Urban Area and Centralized IT Park Project in Can Tho and Phu Binh Residential Area Project in Tam Ky. Echoing these insights, Dao Thi Mai Hoa, Sustainable Investment Officer at GGGI, detailed blended finance mechanisms and public–private models capable of bringing those projects to market, underscoring the need to leverage both domestic funds and international climate finance.\nTo close the event, private-sector perspectives showcased how planning is translating into bankable projects. Ngo Thi Thanh Truc of NANOEN, a consulting firm for project development, introduced an investable concept for Can Tho’s New Urban Area and Centralised IT Park, illustrating design elements that can attract green investment. Ha Quang Anh, Acting Director of the Centre for Climate Change Adaptation and Carbon Neutrality, followed with a residential cooling project now under development in Da Nang’s Quang Phu Ward, a tangible example of UCAP proposals being realized on the ground. Together, these presentations demonstrated how UCAPs are generating pipeline-ready opportunities aligned with Viet Nam’s climate and green growth goals.\n#### **A Model for scalable urban cooling**\nUCAPs provide a blueprint for cities to turn high-level climate goals into practical solutions. By integrating granular heat mapping, climate-responsive design, supportive policies, and project development strategies, UCAPs help cities reduce heat risk, cut energy use, protect public health, and mobilize green finance. The newly published Urban Cooling Action Plan for Can Tho exemplifies this approach, using granular heat mapping, design guidance, regulatory integration, and project development strategies to support climate-resilient urban planning. This outcome adds to the UNEP Cool Coalition’s broader efforts across Southeast Asia to accelerate uptake of sustainable cooling, ensuring that national pledges translate into measurable urban action.\nThe Urban Cooling Action Plan for Can Tho city is available [in English](https://coolcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Action-Plan-Report-on-Urban-Cooling-for-Can-Tho-City_ENG.pdf) and [in Vietnamese](https://coolcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Action-Plan-Report-on-Urban-Cooling-for-Can-Tho-City_VIE.pdf), offering a model that other cities in Viet Nam and beyond can draw upon in the journey toward cooler, climate-friendly cities\nMore information on the Sustainable Urban Cooling in Viet Nam’s Cities event is available [here](https://coolcoalition.org/events/sustainable-urban-cooling-in-viet-nams-cities/)."

    "content": "While energy keeps the world running, clean energy safeguards the planet for future generations by reducing carbon emissions and environmental harm. This International Clean Energy Day, take a moment to think about how sustainable cooling and clean energy work together to tackle global challenges—from preserving food to keeping people healthy and comfortable in an overheating world.\nHere are five ways the UNEP Cool Coalition is highlighting this connection through innovative projects:\n##### **1. Cold Chain Revolution: Keeping Crops Fresh with Clean Energy**\nIn India, the UNEP Cool Coalition, in partnership with the Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy, is implementing the [India Cold Chain Programme](https://coolcoalition.org/india-cold-chain-programme/) (ICCP) in the states of [Bihar](https://coolcoalition.org/workshop-on-accelerating-climate-friendly-and-integrated-cold-chain-development-for-agriculture-in-india/) and Haryana. The program introduces rural cold chain infrastructures like integrated packhouses powered by solar, biomass, and hybrid renewable energy solutions. These packhouses reduce food loss, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and enhance rural livelihoods, especially for women and youth. By the end of 2025, the ICCP and the Bureau of Energy Efficiency will launch National Design Guidelines for Energy-Efficient Packhouse Infrastructure, paving the way for sustainable cold chains across the country.\n**2. Passive Cooling: Designing Buildings That Beat the Heat Naturally**\nThe joint project by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and the UNEP Cool Coalition, titled “[Passive Cooling Strategies for Sustainable Development in Cambodia](https://coolcoalition.org/pilot-projects/passive-cooling-in-cambodia/),” showcases the power of natural cooling solutions. In Cambodia, where 45% of electricity is used for cooling, passive strategies like better building designs and materials cut energy use and emissions. The project equips local architects, engineers, and students with tools and knowledge while supporting policies like Cambodia’s National Cooling Action Plan. A pilot initiative is demonstrating how passive cooling can transform energy demand in a warming world.\n##### **3. Cooling Entire Neighborhoods, Not Just Buildings**\nIn India, the UNEP Cool Coalition has helped establish a District Cooling Hub, a space connecting cooling experts with municipalities. The Hub focuses on developing policies, facilitating technology transfer, and building capacity to implement centralized cooling systems. By sharing cooling across entire neighborhoods, these systems save energy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and support the shift to clean energy solutions, making urban cooling more sustainable.\n##### **4. Renewables in Action: Cooling Powered by the Sun and Wind**\nWith support from the [Global Cooling Pledge](https://coolcoalition.org/global-cooling-pledge/), the \n##### **5. Cooling for All: Sustainable Solutions for Underserved Communities**\nThe UNEP Cool Coalition is working to make sustainable cooling accessible to the world’s most vulnerable populations. By promoting energy-efficient technologies and low-global-warming refrigerants, the coalition ensures underserved communities can withstand extreme heat, access life-saving medicines, and preserve food supplies. These solutions are critical for building resilience to climate change while advancing clean energy transitions."

    "title": "Cooling Cambodia: A Blueprint for Climate-Smart and Energy-Efficient Design",
    "content": "In Cambodia’s hot and humid tropical climate, keeping buildings cool often means relying on energy-intensive systems, drive up costs, emissions, and environmental impacts. But what if we could be reimagined cooling by harnessing nature, advanced materials and optimized design to create naturally cooler spaces? The newly released [Compendium for Passive Cooling Strategies in Cambodia](https://coolcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Compendium-for-Passive-Cooling-Strategies-in-Cambodia.pdf) provides a comprehensive guide for transforming this vision into reality. Designed for architects, urban planners, and building professionals, it outlines practical solutions for embracing sustainable, climate-smart construction.\nThe Compendium highlights how passive cooling strategies can significantly reduce energy demand, while enhancing comfort and resilience in both urban and rural environments. Its recommendations are grouped into three key approaches, tailored specifically to the country’s climatic conditions.\n  * **Site-oriented strategies** Incorporating tree canopies, green corridors, and other landscaping techniques, these strategies can reduce temperatures, combat the urban heat island effect, and provide essential shading.\n  * **Design-focused solutions** Techniques including stack ventilation and night cooling systems leverage airflow dynamics to naturally regulate indoor temperatures, reducing mechanical reliance.\n  * **Material-based approaches** Options like insulated walls and reflective roofs offer effective ways to minimize heat absorption and improve overall energy efficiency.\n\n\nBy combining these strategies, buildings can reduce cooling demand by 30% to 50%, yielding substantial energy savings, cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and improving occupant comfort.\nBeyond theory, the Compendium features inspiring case studies from around the world, showcasing real-world applications of these strategies. Examples include reflective pavements in Tokyo, which mitigate extreme heat, and night cooling systems in India that take advantage of cooler nighttime temperatures to enhance energy efficiency.\nEach chapter of the Compendium offers technical guidelines and delivers actionable insights, user-friendly technical descriptions, and practical steps for integrating passive cooling techniques into building projects. It also emphasizes the importance of tailoring solutions to specific contexts, ensuring that buildings meet local needs while addressing broader challenges like climate change and rapid urbanization.\nAs Cambodia faces the dual challenges of global warming and urban growth, the Compendium for Passive Cooling serves as both a roadmap and a call to action. It illustrates how passive cooling can become a cornerstone in the creation of resilient, sustainable communities. By adopting these strategies, Cambodia has the potential to set a regional example, demonstrating the immense benefits of energy-efficient design and solutions that work harmoniously with nature to prioritize both people and the planet.\nThe Compendium for Passive Cooling Strategies in Cambodia is developed by the Ministry of Environment of the Royal Government of Cambodia with technical support from the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, and the United Nations Environment Programme within the framework of the Cool Coalition. The Compendium is developed under the project [Passive Cooling Strategies for Sustainable Development in Cambodia](https://coolcoalition.org/pilot-projects/passive-cooling-in-cambodia/) with funding support from the ClimateWorks Foundation."

At last year’s event, more than 40 sessions featuring 235 speakers demonstrated how investments in district and passive cooling can help nations cope with increasing temperatures while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This intersection of sustainable cooling and building decarbonization will be even more prominent in Belém, aiming to scale up innovations that safeguard vulnerable populations and ecosystems from extreme heat. The Pavilion will bring together the entire cooling community and built environment value chain, offering special events, launches of new projects and reports, and an interactive panel showcasing key UNEP Cool Coalition publications. Among them, the Global Cooling Watch 2025, a biennial, data-driven report that lays out strategies for achieving near-zero cooling emissions, which is set to launch one month before COP30.\nThe UNEP Cool Coalition’s mainstay at COP30 will be the second Ministerial Roundtable, where more than 70 nations and 60 non-state actors will report on their progress in implementing the [Global Cooling Pledge](https://coolcoalition.org/global-cooling-pledge/). Coming at a pivotal time for countries’ next round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs 3.0), the Roundtable will feature the Annual Global Cooling Pledge Progress Report 2025, and introduce the newly formed Intergovernmental Committee on Cooling (IGCC), an expanded governance mechanism designed to reinforce collaboration and accountability.

    "title": "Cool Coalition Coordination Call: Strengthening Governance and Driving Global Cooling Action",
    "content": "On 18 March 2025, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Cool Coalition convened its first Membership Coordination Call for the year, bringing together over 70 representatives from governments, businesses, international organizations, and civil society. The session served as a crucial checkpoint to align governance structures, strengthen policy integration, and chart the Coalition’s path toward the 2025 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém, Brazil.\nAt its core, the Cool Coalition is driven by the principle that collaboration drives impact. With over 130 members worldwide, it advances science, policy, finance, and technology to meet growing demand for sustainable cooling. Their work is anchored in the [Global Cooling Pledge](https://coolcoalition.org/global-cooling-pledge/), a landmark commitment to reduce cooling-related emissions by 68% by 2050. Today, over 70 national and subnational Signatories and more than 50 institutional supporters are driving this ambition forward, accelerating progress in line with the \nThe Coalition’s Membership Calls are essential for maintaining coordination, engagement, and momentum. This latest convening reinforced a central message: with transparent governance, cross-sector collaboration, and targeted solutions, the world can achieve an ambitious yet attainable cooling transition.\n####  **From Commitment to Implementation** **: A Call for Collective Action**\nCool Coalition Global Coordinator Lily Riahi opened the session by underscoring the power of collective action in turning pledges into real-world results. “Delivering on the Pledge requires experts, leaders, and innovators across the cooling value chain to collaborate as one,” she said. Riahi acknowledged the vital contributions of the Cool Coalition Steering Committee and urged Members to engage actively in the [Cool Coalition’s Working Groups](https://coolcoalition.org/about/what-we-do/), which serve as vital communities of practice for advancing sustainable cooling solutions. With COP30 fast approaching, her call to action was clear: “We’ve put cooling on the global agenda, and we have political support for the Global Cooling Pledge. Now we need to demonstrate on-the-ground implementation.”\n#### **Governance Updates: Strengthening the Coalition’s Foundations**\nCo-chaired by Cool Coalition Executive Committee Members, Senior Associate Director at the Clean Cooling Collaborative, Axum Teferra, and Lead Technical Advisor at the UK Department for Energy Security and Net-Zero, Graeme Maidment, the meeting began with an overview of the 2024–2026 Cool Coalition Steering Committee. Representing governments, businesses, civil society, and academia, the Steering Committee provides strategic guidance, endorses initiatives, and directs the Coalition’s overall work. “The Cool Coalition is only as strong as member engagement,” Teferra noted. “There’s a wealth of activity happening across the Coalition; we must make it visible and connected,” Maidment added, urging collective knowledge-sharing as COP30 nears.\nBuilding on this, Cool Coalition Country Engagement and Climate Policy Lead, Amr Seleem, introduced the Intergovernmental Committee on Cooling (IGCC), an expanded governance mechanism for the Global Cooling Pledge. It evolved from the initial 18-country Contact Group that negotiated the Pledge at COP28 and will be formally adopted at COP30 to ensure all Signatories have a seat at the table. “The IGCC builds on our existing foundation, enabling a more inclusive structure to guide sustainable cooling worldwide,” Seleem explained. Over the next few months, the Cool Coalition Secretariat will finalize the IGCC’s Terms of Reference with Signatories, aiming for full operationalization in 2026.\n#### **Cross-cutting Policy Updates: Integrating Cooling into National Commitments**\nA major thread of the session was ensuring that cooling is firmly embedded in countries’ climate strategies. Dietram Oppelt, Managing Director at HEAT, shared progress on the Guidelines for Integrating the Cooling Sector into Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), developed through the Cool Coalition’s NDC Working Group. “We are in the final stages of developing the Guidelines, ensuring they are both practical and actionable,” he said. One section will focus specifically on financing, helping countries mobilize resources to scale sustainable cooling.\nOn the link between planning and action, Etienne Gonin, Technical Specialist at UNDP, emphasized the role of National Cooling Action Plans (NCAPs). “Tracking progress is essential—not just in developing NCAPs but ensuring they evolve, adapt, and remain actionable,” he said, citing active development across Jordan, Egypt, Türkiye, and in partnership with regional institutions in Africa and Asia-Pacific.\nBen Hartley, Programme Manager for Cooling for All at Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), reinforced the momentum behind NCAPs in countries such as Madagascar, Mozambique, and Zambia. He also highlighted heat action planning in nine Kenyan counties under subnational Global Cooling Pledge commitments. “There is a lot of opportunity to integrate access to cooling into national strategies, and we’re seeing increasing momentum from countries that recognize the urgent need to scale solutions,” Hartley said. Reflecting on SEforALL’s Global Forum in Barbados, Hartley referenced the Small Island Developing States Ministerial communique calling for rapid adoption of sustainable cooling solutions.\n#### **Thematic Priorities: Passive Cooling, Urban Heat Adaptation, and Energy Efficiency**\nOn the technology front, Manjeet Singh, Senior Project Specialist at the Cool Coalition, spotlighted passive cooling as a key low-cost, low-energy solution. “With extreme heat intensifying and air conditioning penetration straining power systems, passive cooling must be embedded into urban infrastructure and policy frameworks to ensure sustainable and equitable cooling solutions,” he stressed. He shared updates from Cambodia where passive cooling is being piloted with real estate developers and integrated into national policy, and Viet Nam, where partners are embedding urban cooling into regulatory frameworks. Singh also introduced the Passive Cooling Roadmap for ASEAN, developed under the Passive Cooling Working Group.\nHuub Keizer, Board Member at the International Council for Research and Innovation in Building and Construction and Business Manager at TNO, emphasized urban planning as a tool for cooling. “By designing with nature, we can reduce urban temperatures by 5 to 7 degrees Celsius,” he explained, noting that new policy guidelines will be launched at COP30 to guide this shift.\nOn urban adaptation, Graeme Maidment shared learnings from Manchester, UK, which reached 38.9°C in 2022—record temperatures for a city unprepared for such extremes. “One of the biggest challenges is that different organizations are working in silos,” he said. The Cool Coalition’s Urban Heat Working Group is helping align approaches to strengthen city-level resilience.\nPatrick Blake, Programme Manager at United for Efficiency, UNEP, provided updates on energy efficiency, noting that 49 Global Cooling Pledge Signatories have adopted Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) for cooling. “Stronger efficiency standards are one of the fastest ways to cut cooling emissions,” he said. Blake also previewed Sustainable Procurement Guidelines for Data Centres and Servers, a response to the sector’s soaring energy use, up to 50% of which goes to cooling.\nClosing the thematic updates, Denise San Valentin, Programme Management Officer at the Climate & Clean Air Coalition, highlighted refrigerants as a critical frontier for emissions reduction. “Without action on refrigerants, we risk undermining global cooling progress,” she warned. San Valentin showcased CCAC’s 2030 Cooling Strategy, which accelerates the shift away from high-GWP HFCs and supports refrigerant lifecycle management through the Cool Coalition LRM Working Group.\n#### **Data and Science: Tracking Progress to Guide Policy**\nIn the session on science and narratives, Xinfang Wang, Associate Professor at the Birmingham Energy Institute and Cooling Emissions Specialist at the UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, outlined work from the Cooling Refrigeration Emissions and Energy Data (CREED) Working Group to standardize cooling emissions data. “Cooling is increasingly recognized as both a mitigation and adaptation strategy, yet data gaps remain a major challenge,” she said.\nRay Gluckman, Director of Gluckman Consulting and lead author of the inaugural \n#### **Road to COP30: Elevating Cooling on the Global Stage**\nRounding out the call, Marisofi Giannouli, Communications Lead for the Cool Coalition, outlined the Coalition’s outreach plans for the year. These include the second Global Cooling Pledge Ministerial Roundtable and a high-profile Buildings and Cooling Pavilion at COP30, co-hosted with the GlobalABC. “We are expanding our COP presence to be an even bigger platform for knowledge-sharing and action,” Giannouli said. She also introduced the Cool Talks webinar series as a tool for sustaining engagement between major summits. Topics this year will include finance, passive cooling, and urban adaptation. “If your organization is interested in joining, now is the time,” she emphasized, inviting all members to contribute.\nAs the call concluded, co-chairs Axum Teferra and Graeme Maidment applauded the breadth of expertise shared, calling it “a testament to the Cool Coalition’s collective drive.” Reflecting on the session, Lily Riahi reaffirmed the importance of this community of practice: “It is through this community that we can provide the joint technical support and accountability needed to transform ambition into action.”\n**Please see below for speakers’ presentations.**\n[Patrick Blake](https://coolcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Patrick-Blake.pdf)\n[Etienne Gonin](https://coolcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Etienne-Gonin.pptx)\n[Huub Keizer](https://coolcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Huub-Keizer.pptx)\n[Full slide deck](https://coolcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250318_Coordination-Call_slide-deck.pptx)"

    "title": "Training for Heat Adaptation: Building Cooler, Resilient Cities in Tamil Nadu",
    "content": "Chennai, a key industrial center in southern India, faces intense heat waves each year. Home to over 12 million, the city’s dense population, along with high-density urban development and shrinking green cover are driving a sharp rise in local temperatures. In this context, integrating passive and ecosystem-based cooling solutions has become more critical than ever to safeguard public health and advance sustainable urban development.\nFrom 25-27 June 2025, a capacity building program titled “Training for Heat Adaptation in Cities and Buildings with Passive and Ecosystem Approaches for Cooling,” was held at the Anna Administrative Staff College. The training was a joint effort by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Cool Coalition and the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC), to equip Tamil Nadu government officials with knowledge and tools to implement passive cooling solutions.\nThe opening remarks were delivered by Mr. Vikram Kapur, Director, Anna Administrative Staff College, who highlighted the anthropogenic causes contributing to urban heat. He also stressed the responsibility and capacity of both government agencies and individuals to mitigate these impacts. This was followed by session by Ms. Aarti Nain, Advisor to the UNEP India Urban Cooling Program, who provided a comprehensive overview of sustainable cooling efforts in India. She outlined key challenges in implementing climate-friendly cooling solutions, along with short- and long-term recommendations and best practices from the India Cooling Action Plan.\n#### **Understanding Urban Heat Islands and their Impact**\nProfessor Rajan Rawal, Senior Advisor at CARBSE, CEPT University, delivered an in-depth session on the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. He explained key contributing factors such as urban geometry, surface properties, lack of green cover, and human activity. Emphasizing the critical role of urban planners and designers, he discussed tools and techniques for mitigating UHI through thoughtful design and planning. Key takeaways included the importance of optimizing building design for heat mitigation, integrating green infrastructure, and understanding hyperlocal heat data. The session also explored the secondary impacts of UHI, including reduced productivity, decreased livestock output, and the underreporting of heat-related deaths.\n#### **Climate-Responsive Building Design and Low-Carbon Materials: Insights and Applications**\nMs. Suhasini Ayer, Architect & Urban Planner, Professor Durganand Balsavar, Senior Advisor, UNEP, and Professor Rajan Rawal led a panel discussion with the participants on climate-responsive design of buildings and cities with low-carbon materials. The focus was on integrating thermal comfort through master planning, passively cooled buildings and using sustainable, cost-effective building materials.\nMs. Ayer detailed how urban heat is shaped by various spatial and temporal aspects and highlighted the long-term costs of compromising on climate-responsive design, noting challenges within existing building construction regulations. The panel underscored the roles of planners and designers in integrating shading, natural ventilation, and green infrastructure into urban form.\nTo illustrate these principles, Ms. Ayer presented the example of the Humanscapes, a project in Auroville that combines the integration of climate-responsive urban forms, strategic shading, natural ventilation, and the use of local materials to achieve thermal comfort and sustainability. On the workshop’s third day, participants visited Humanscapes, Auroville Earth Institute and Revelation Forest.Revelation Forest, one of the more densely afforested communities of Auroville was also shown to trainees to demonstrate the impact of thoughtful species selection and landscape design in moderating temperature and humidity.\nThroughout the training, experts stressed designing buildings and neighborhoods that protect, support, and enhance heat adaptation by addressing water management, energy efficiency, topsoil preservation, vegetation, shading, and resilience to extreme weather.\n#### **Policy, Planning, and Implementation**\nThis interactive session engaged participants in a discussion on essential policy interventions for heat resilience, noting that heat is a state-specific disaster. Participants explored urban planning strategies such as creating green spaces (with considerations for water use and wind flow) and improving “sky view” to facilitate heat radiation. The opportunity of balancing rapid housing development with heat mitigation was also assessed. Trainees revied the opportunities such as leveraging the potential for social capital to aid heat management and the need for region-specific building codes with the expert trainers.\n#### **Towards a Cooler Tamil Nadu**\nThe training reinforced the Cool Coalition’s commitment to building heat-resilient cities by equipping government officials with practical knowledge and scalable solutions for extreme heat adaptation. It stressed extreme heat as not just an environmental priority, but also a critical public health and economic imperative. Supported by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, the BeCool project is supporting passive and ecosystem-based cooling through policy, planning, and pilot demonstrations across Tamil Nadu and other states in India."

    "content": "As Africa grapples with record-breaking heatwaves, the continent’s rapidly growing cities stand on the frontline of a climate emergency. According to the World Meteorological Organization, the past decade was the hottest ever recorded, pushing urban populations into a state of increased vulnerability. Rising temperatures threaten health, food security, and productivity, while projections from UNEP’s \nRecognizing this urgency, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), through its Cool Coalition and the \nAt the heart of the dialogue was the BeCool programme, a joint initiative by UNEP and SDC successfully piloted in India. BeCool advances passive cooling and nature-based solutions (NbS) through policy reform, innovative finance, and strategic capacity-building. Discussions at AMCEN-20 explored pathways for sharing the BeCool model between Asia and Africa, through identifying opportunities for mutual learning.\nMartin Krause, Director of UNEP’s Climate Change Division, opened the dialogue by calling attention to the economic and social costs being felt across Africa due to escalating heat. “Extreme heat is already costing African economies and putting millions at risk, especially in fast-growing cities,” he said. Krause called for sustainable cooling to become a central element in national and city-level planning, and emphasized the need for cross-regional partnerships to drive practical solutions.\nBuilding on this call for partnership, Julien Peissard, Deputy Regional Head of International Cooperation at the SDC, stressed that the BeCool experience in India offers valuable lessons but is not a one-size-fits-all solution. “BeCool is not a blueprint, but a starting point for dialogue and mutual learning,” he explained. “Our goal is to support African partners in developing technical and financial partnerships that enable cities to leapfrog towards climate resilience with solutions tailored to their realities.”\nAarti Nain, Advisor for Extreme Heat and Sustainable Cooling at the UNEP Cool Coalition, delved deeper into BeCool India’s operational successes. Nain detailed how passive cooling solutions, such as reflective roofs, shading, natural ventilation, and strategic green, are being mainstreamed across several Indian states and cities. Early results have been promising, with pilot projects reducing indoor temperatures by up to four degrees Celsius and lowering energy demand in buildings by nearly one-third. “We are transforming mindsets and market rules to drive sustainable cooling of buildings,” Nain emphasized, noting that BeCool is still in its early stages and has much to offer through mutual learning with African partners.\nThe conversation then expanded into food systems and cold chains, critical for securing livelihoods. Amr Seleem, Country Engagement and Climate Policy Lead at the UNEP Cool Coalition, highlighted the urgent need to improve Africa’s post-harvest cooling infrastructure. “Up to 50% of fresh produce in parts of Africa is lost post-harvest due to inadequate cold chains, a problem exacerbated by rising temperatures,” Seleem pointed out. Drawing parallels with India’s experience, Seleem showed how targeted interventions, linking national planning, strategic investments, and local capacity-building, can significantly reduce food loss, emissions, and strengthen rural incomes. He finished his presentation encouraging African countries to take advantage of the resources and support available through the [Global Cooling Pledge](https://coolcoalition.org/global-cooling-pledge/).\nRegional leaders then shared ongoing efforts to integrate cooling into national and local climate actions. Dr. Abdullahi Khalif, representing the NDC Partnership in Somalia, outlined how his country, highly vulnerable to extreme heat, is embedding cooling measures directly into its updated Nationally Determined Contributions. Khalif emphasized collaboration with UNEP, the Cool Coalition and SDC as essential for technical and financial guidance.\nMohamed Sharif Ibrahim, Deputy Executive Director of IRAD Somalia, highlighted the potential of renewable-powered cold chains as a transformative tool, particularly in fragile states, strengthening critical infrastructure for food security and healthcare.\nKennedy Matheka, National Coordinator for Buildings and Climate Resilience in Kenya’s Ministry of Lands, Public Works, Housing and Urban Development, described Kenya’s efforts to align building codes and affordable housing policies with climate resilience and passive cooling principles. He also noted Kenya’s role in the \nFinally, Cape Town’s Executive Deputy Mayor Eddie Andrews spotlighted the unique role cities play in climate adaptation, emphasizing the urgency of municipal action. Andrews called for strengthened national-city alignment, finance mobilization, and international support. “Cities are on the frontline of the heat crisis, and we need support to build solutions that match the scale of the challenge,” he noted.\nAs the dialogue drew to a close, Martin Krause reflected on the challenges ahead, noting the critical need for stronger partnerships and investment to turn momentum into action. With growing knowledge, proven solutions, and a spirit of regional cooperation, participants agreed that Africa has the opportunity to chart a new path for heat resilience, if national and city leaders are supported to scale up sustainable cooling. The ongoing work of AMCEN can help ensure Africa’s cities lead the way in climate-smart development, setting examples for adaptation in a warming world.\nThe momentum from the technical event carried over to the next morning’s Breakfast Dialogue on Cities and Climate, where African Mayors, Governors, and national experts engaged directly with leading climate scientists on hard adaptation limits, tipping points, and the urgency of accelerating sustainable cooling uptake and climate-responsive urban planning. Participants emphasized closing the gap between national climate planning and local realities, and discussed how better collaboration across government levels can equip cities to protect lives and livelihoods.\nOutcomes from [these events](https://coolcoalition.org/cities-unit-at-amcen-20/) are now set to shape AMCEN’s technical guidance for 2025–2027, underscoring the necessity for subnational and national actions to align closely with ambitious climate commitments, so Africa’s cities have the resources and partnerships they need to build a more heat-resilient future."

This first of its kind inter-ministerial initiative addresses one of the most significant contributors to global warming, guiding Indonesia towards a greener, cooler, and net-zero future.\nThe I-NCAP focuses on five critical areas: building space cooling, food cold chains, healthcare cold chains, mobile air conditioning and process cooling, and aligns with Indonesia’s enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). Developed with support from the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and inputs from Sustainable Energy for All within the framework of the Cool Coalition, the I-NCAP represents a comprehensive policy roadmap to address increasing cooling demand, enhance energy efficiency in cooling appliances, and promote the use of low-global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants.\nDr. ​Eniya Listiani Dewi, Director General of the Directorate General of New, Renewable Energy, and Energy Conservation\n“ _The launch of Indonesia’s National Cooling Action Plan marks a crucial step in our commitment to protect our people from extreme heat with climate-friendly cooling solutions. This National Cooling Action Plan will serve as a systematic and comprehensive framework to realize lower energy demand and emissions while improving the resilience of our population and economic sectors,_ ” said **Dr. ​Eniya Listiani Dewi, Director General of the Directorate General of New, Renewable Energy, and Energy Conservation (EBTKE)** under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources.\nThe I-NCAP is an inter-ministerial policy roadmap led by the Directorate General of New, Renewable Energy, and Energy Conservation (EBTKE) and includes collaboration from numerous national stakeholders. In a statement on the occasion of the launch, **Mr. Hongpeng Liu, Director of the Energy Division of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)** , “As the result of exemplary cross-ministerial and multi-agency collaboration, Indonesia’s National Cooling Action Plan stands as a beacon of the integrated approach needed to address the complex challenges of sustainable development in the context of our changing climate. This initiative not only underscores Indonesia’s commitment to sustainable cooling but also sets a benchmark for other nations to follow in working towards a more resilient, energy efficient and climate-friendly future.”\nIn 2020, the total electricity consumed by space cooling in Indonesia’s buildings and the food cold chain sector combined was 79 TWh, equivalent to 30 per cent of the nation’s total electricity consumption. In the absence of effective interventions in the building sector, electricity demand is expected to rise nearly 400%, from 62 TWh in 2020 to 241 TWh by 2040. However, through targeted policy interventions, market enablers and regulatory enforcement, technological and financial interventions, and capacity building strategies, the I-NCAP aims to mitigate this rise by 57 per cent, capping space cooling demand in buildings at 104 TWh by 2040.\n**Ms. Ruth Zugman do Coutto, Chief of the Mitigation Branch of the Climate Change Division of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)** said,_The I-NCAP follows comprehensive vision to delivering on cooling, looking at the multiple cooling sectors to ensure thermal comfort in buildings, strengthening resilience to extreme heat, and bringing essential life‐preserving services like vaccines and safe food to all people while driving climate action. We applaud Indonesia’s leadership in releasing this plan and encourage the continued collaboration among ministries and stakeholders to pursue its implementation and ensure a cooler, more sustainable future for millions of people._ ”\nAs the world approaches the G20 Clean Energy Ministerial and COP29, the launch of the I-NCAP will showcase Indonesia’s leadership in the cooling sector and the nation’s commitment to innovative, sustainable cooling solutions, driving global action on climate-friendly cooling. At the same time, its success hinges on Indonesian ministries, industry stakeholders, and international partners joining forces in supporting the implementation of the I-NCAP. Towards this, the **EBTKE Director General** stated, “ _We call upon the international community to join Indonesia in implementing this plan, ensuring sustainable access to cooling for all. Together, we can pave the way for a greener future, mitigating climate impacts while fostering innovation and resilience in our cooling sector._ ”\nPlease find the I-NCAP available for download here: [2024-RP-Indonesia-National-Cooling-Action-Plan](https://coolcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ESCAP-2024-RP-Indonesia-National-Cooling-Action-Plan-1.pdf)\n**Notes to Editors**\n**About the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources Indonesia** The Directorate General of New, Renewable Energy, and Energy Conservation (EBTKE) is a key agency under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) in Indonesia.

    "content": "b\n\n# The Cool Future: Exploring Sustainable District Cooling Solutions from the MENA Region to Europe\nAs the planet heats up, finding sustainable ways to stay cool has become one of the most pressing challenges of our time. On 12 December 2024, Euroheat & Power, Empower, and the UNEP Cool Coalition came together to address this issue through the webinar “The Cool Future: Exploring Sustainable District Cooling Solutions from the MENA Region to Europe.” Against the backdrop of rising global temperatures and growing urbanization, this event underscored the urgent need for energy-efficient cooling systems to combat climate change and meet increasing cooling demands. The session brought together experts from across the globe to explore scalable, region-specific solutions, and to share best practices on how district cooling can enhance energy efficiency, reduce emissions, and build climate-resilient cities.\nThe event’s moderator, Victoria Liénard, Policy Advisor at Euroheat & Power, set the stage, explaining how district cooling works and why it’s a vital solution in the fight against climate change. Highlighting its efficiency, she described district cooling as a centralized system that distributes cooling through an integrated network, optimizing energy use and achieving significant environmental benefits. Liénard emphasized that district cooling can reduce energy consumption by up to 50% compared to traditional air-conditioning, while also ensuring grid stability and addressing the growing strain on electricity systems. This makes it an essential tool for tackling rising cooling demands globally, particularly in regions that face distinct challenges when it comes to extreme heat and humidity.\nLuis Munuera, Senior Advisor on Urban Energy at UNEP, outlined the ways that UNEP is supporting national governments to incorporate district cooling into their energy transition plans by sharing best practices, providing technical assistance, and offering tools and methodologies. Work is already underway in countries like Chile, Ukraine, Egypt, Tunisia, India, Viet Nam, while in India, the UNEP Cool Coalition has supported the establishment of a District Cooling Hub, an innovative physical space for linking experts with municipalities, and strengthening policy advisory, technology transfer, and capacity building.\n“International collaboration works best when you face a global problem with local implementation,” said Munuera. “We’ve seen evidence of it with the Kigali Amendment and the Global Cooling Pledge.” He went on to explain how district cooling can be positioned within major events. For instance, as Munuera pointed out in his presentation, at the recent United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan, the UNEP Cool Coalition leveraged its strong presence in the [“Delivering on the Global Cooling Pledge” Ministerial Roundtable](https://coolcoalition.org/cop29-ministerial-roundtable-delivering-on-the-global-cooling-pledge/) and at the [Buildings and Cooling Pavilion](https://coolcoalition.org/cop29-buildings-and-cooling-pavilion/) to champion the integration of sustainable cooling into national climate policies, and to highlight the importance of district cooling.\nThe discussion then transitioned to the regional level, focusing specifically on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Samer Khoudeir, Chief Sales & Marketing Officer at Empower, emphasized that in the Middle East, where around 70% of energy consumption in buildings is attributed to air conditioning, district cooling has become an essential solution for reducing power demand and greenhouse gas emissions. The region’s arid climate, characterized by extreme heat and minimal natural ventilation, severely limits the effectiveness of passive cooling methods. This makes sustainable cooling systems, like district cooling, not just a practical option but an indispensable necessity for ensuring comfort and combating climate change.\nEmpower, the world’s largest district cooling services provider, recognizes it as a strategic climate solution for warmer regions, delivering energy-efficient and cost-effective cooling to over 140,000 customers in Dubai and beyond. Khoudeir highlighted Dubai’s leadership, where district cooling is a cornerstone of the city’s sustainability targets. Dubai aims to achieve 40% district cooling penetration by 2030 through the implementation of integrated strategies like the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy and Demand Side Management Strategy, supported by the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy. “District cooling in the MENA region isn’t just an environmental solution; it’s an economic necessity,” said Khoudeir. “By reducing electricity consumption by up to 50%, we’re proving that sustainable cooling can drive both climate and financial resilience.”\nThe conversation moved from the MENA region to Europe, a region traditionally unaccustomed to extreme heat but now facing increasingly severe heatwaves as a result of climate change. District cooling networks in Europe have grown significantly to meet this challenge, with sales reaching 3.3 TWh in 2022—an 8% increase from previous years. The region boasts over 200 district cooling networks spanning 1,375 kilometers of pipelines, with dominant markets in Sweden and France. While these networks primarily serve tertiary sectors, they are increasingly being integrated into residential and storage needs, highlighting the sector’s adaptability to evolving demands.\nDiana Adam, Policy and Regulation Officer at BEW Berlin, shared insights from Germany, emphasizing the importance of integrating sustainable cooling solutions into urban planning. Adam explained that BEW operates one of Germany’s largest district cooling networks, with a focus on innovative practices like utilizing waste heat to enhance efficiency. Highlighting their work at Potsdamer Platz, she noted, “By integrating a high-temperature heat pump into the cooling plant, we’ve been able to repurpose waste heat and renewable electricity to provide heat for 30,000 households in summer and heating for 3,000 households in winter.”\nAndrea Voight, Vice President of Global Public Affairs and Sustainability at Danfoss, provided a complementary perspective from Copenhagen. She highlighted Danfoss’s leadership in district cooling innovation, pointing to Copenhagen as a role model for sustainable urban cooling. The city utilizes seawater to power its district cooling system, with 50% of its capacity serving comfort cooling for offices and shops and the remaining 50% focused on process cooling for hospitals and data centers. District cooling contributes to the city’s goal of reducing CO2 emissions, as nearly 70% of Copenhagen’s urban energy consumption comes from heating and cooling systems in urban areas.\n“Copenhagen exemplifies the symbiosis between district heating and cooling systems,” Voight explained. “By coupling district heating and cooling with sources like wastewater and renewable energy, Copenhagen maximizes efficiency and minimizes waste, paving the way for cities around the world to follow suit.”\nThe webinar concluded with reflections on the transformative potential of district cooling in combating climate challenges and paving the way for greener, more resilient cities. Moderator Victoria Liénard emphasized that scaling these solutions is a necessity for sustainable urban growth. As echoed throughout the discussions, district cooling stands as a beacon of innovation, offering a tangible pathway to a future where cities thrive while reducing their environmental footprint.\nShare\nWe Will: Efficient, Climate-Friendly Cooling for All\nReceive latest stories, news on efficient, climate-friendly cooling and join the movement!"

Extreme heat amplifies inequality, inflames food insecurity, and pushes people further into poverty. As said by the UN Secretary-General António Guterres in his , we must respond by massively increasing access to low-carbon cooling.\nThe untapped urgency and opportunity of cooling led the COP28 Presidency to launch the [Global Cooling Pledge](https://coolcoalition.org/global-cooling-pledge/) together with**over 70 countries and 60 non-state actors**. The Pledge marks the **world’s first collective effort to reduce cooling related emissions across all sectors by at least 68%****globally by 2050** , consistent with limiting global average temperature rise to 1.5°C and in line with reaching global net-zero emissions targets, while significantly increasing access to sustainable cooling by 2030 for the vulnerable populations.\nDelivering on the Pledge could cut emissions by around 78 billion tons by 2050 while protecting billions of people from the impacts of extreme heat. Central to the Global Cooling Pledge is the **commitment by countries to undertake an annual review** and report back on progress at a dedicated high-level meeting at the UN Climate Change Conference annually through 2030.\nThis Ministerial roundtable will serve as a **launchpad for action on cooling** and will provide an opportunity to**share the collective progress** on the implementation of the Global Cooling Pledge, including on mainstreaming cooling in the **next round of Nationally Determined Contributions**. The roundtable will also allow Signatories to share views on how they can together contribute to the delivery of the UN Secretary-General’s Call to Action on Extreme Heat. It will also announce the incoming chair of the GCP Contact Group and propose the establishment of an Intergovernmental Committee on Cooling (IGCC) for Pledge Signatories.\nObjectives:\n  * Adoption of the Annual Report on Review of Progress\n  * Confirmation of Incoming Chair of Global Cooling Pledge Contact Group\n  * Launch of key actions, including on integrating cooling in NDCs\n  * Introduction of a new Governance for Pledge Signatories\n  * Showcase of whole of government approaches to implementation of the Pledge\n\n\n### Event recording\n### Additional statements\n  *   * ##### [Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure](https://coolcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CDRI.pdf)\n  * ##### [Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All)](https://coolcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SEforALL.pdf)\n\n\n#### [2030 Global Cooling Pledge Implementation Strategy](https://coolcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Global-Cooling-Pledge-Implementation-Strategy.pdf)\n#### [COP29 GCP Ministerial Roundtable Summary Report](https://coolcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Summary-Report.pdf)\n#### 2024 Annual Global Cooling Pledge Progress Report\n### Media\n**For more information please contact:** unep-coolcoalition@un.org or anya.magotra@un.org"

    "content": "Viet Nam’s rapid urbanization and economic growth are accelerating cooling demand in cities. We support Viet Nam’s cities in taking comprehensive action to deliver sustainable cooling for all, and protect their citizens from extreme heat.\nWHY PASSIVE COOLING IN VIET NAM’S CITIES?\nViet Nam’s rapid urbanization and economic growth are accelerating cooling demand in cities and the urban heat island effect (UHIE). The accompanying surge in power demand and refrigerant use will drive growth in emissions from cooling \nFor Viet Nam early action to curb this emissions growth from cooling is a priority, as highlighted in its\nGreater municipal intervention on cooling and extreme heat is a crucial but underdeveloped element in Viet Nam’s policy frameworks. A whole-system approach to sustainable urban cooling is key to avoid dangerous heat in an optimal and resource-efficient manner by reducing heat at the urban scale, reducing cooling needs in buildings, and serving cooling needs efficiently.\nViet Nam’s cities need cross-cutting financial and capacity support to unlock their vital role as planner, coordinator, financier and advocate for sustainable cooling and protecting their citizens from extreme heat.\nABOUT THE PROJECT\nThe project will support two pilot cities of Can Tho and Tam Ky to prepare Urban Cooling Action Plans (UCAPs) that integrate action on cooling and extreme heat into a range of municipal plans and masterplans. In parallel, the project will support these cities to finance pilot projects and unlock stable municipal budgets for intervention on extreme heat and urban cooling. Dong Hoi city will also receive light touch support through the project. Interventions will include improved urban design, nature-based solutions, passive cooling measures, municipal incentives, district cooling and sustainable public procurement.\nBy working on-the-ground with the pilot cities, the project will tailor the global best practices recommended under the \nThe project is co-led by UNEP and the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) and is being closely executed with Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. The project is funded with the support of the Clean Cooling Collaborative (CCC).\nWHAT WILL THE PROJECT DO\nThe project will work across four key components:\nDemonstrate Comprehensive Urban Cooling Action\nThe project will prepare and support the adoption of Urban Cooling Action Plans and dedicated governance structures in two pilot cities. This will include spatial analysis of cooling and extreme heat, their drivers and recommendations for local policies, planning, financial instruments, and a project pipeline. Demonstration projects in the two cities will be identified and supported to market to showcase comprehensive approaches to delivering sustainable cooling in a building cluster.\nEstablish National Cooling Fund\nThe project will help design and set up a new national cooling fund as part of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment’s Environmental Protection Fund. This will ensure that cities have ready access to investment finance to take action on cooling and extreme heat.\nCapacity Building for Replication of Urban Cooling Strategies\nThrough the pilot city activities, global best practices on urban cooling will be contextualized for Viet Nam and combined with existing local innovation. The project will promote best practices for urban cooling to a wide range of stakeholders and share the pilot cities’ experiences with other cities to increase awareness and their capacity to replicate the pilot city activities.\nNDC Implementation Support through Integrated Policy Approach\nThe project will enhance policymakers’ awareness on urban cooling interventions and their mitigation potential. Viet Nam will be supported to incorporate urban cooling under the NDC Implementation Support Program, an upcoming decree under the Environmental Protection Law, the National Strategy on Climate Change, and other national frameworks such as the National Cooling Plan.\nESTIMATED IMPACT\nComprehensive approaches to cooling in cities that include strong building efficiency measures, passive cooling, urban design, nature-based solutions, super-efficient appliances and district cooling can reduce energy consumption for cooling by greater than 70%.\nReplicating pilot city activities into 5 other cities could reduce emissions by over 30MtCO2.eq/year by 2040 and improve the thermal comfort and resilience of millions.\nIncreased finance into urban cooling projects through the National Cooling Fund canovercome longstanding CAPEX barriers for increased energy efficiency\nUpdated national planning guidelines – based on analysis and action in pilot cities – can put Viet Nam’s cities on a pathway to drastically reduce urban heat island and benefit from diverse adaptation co-benefits from improved urban design and bringing nature into cities\nIncreased awareness and capacity of city, provincial and national government officials on role of cities in tackling cooling and extreme heat and its GHG reduction potential framed under Viet Nam’s ambition to deliver a net-zero economy by 2050.\nURBAN COOLING ACTION PLAN FOR CAN THO\nDeveloped to address the rising demand for sustainable cooling in Viet Nam’s Mekong Delta, this Action Plan offers an evidence-based roadmap to reduce urban heat, enhance thermal comfort, and improve energy efficiency in Can Tho City. It combines microclimate analysis, building simulations, and policy mapping to deliver targeted recommendations for city planners and decision-makers. While tailored to the local context, the Plan presents a scalable framework that can inform urban cooling strategies in other rapidly growing tropical cities around the world.\nAvailable in [English](https://coolcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Action-Plan-Report-on-Urban-Cooling-for-Can-Tho-City_ENG.pdf) and in [Vietnamese](https://coolcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Action-Plan-Report-on-Urban-Cooling-for-Can-Tho-City_VIE.pdf).\nFOR MORE INFORMATION\nTo support the project or to be kept informed on its development, please contact us"

    "content": "####  **Date:** 24 October 2024 **Time:** 13:00 – 15:30 (CET) **Location:** online\n## **Background**\nIn alignment with United Nation’s Secretary General’s Call to Action on Extreme Heat, UNEP Cool Coalition members are developing a Global Standard Approach on Urban Heat/ Cooling Action Plans. This standard approach will guide subnational governments and cities to design and align their actions to reduce heat risks, increase resilience to heat and adoption of sustainable cooling.\nExperts have identified numerous gaps in approaches globally, due to lack of agreed methodologies but also resource and data constraints. Diverse approaches are being tested in cities globally on these three steps.\nThe workshop discusses a three-step approach: 1) raising awareness through urban heat vulnerability mapping and Urban Heat Island assessments; 2) preparedness for heat disasters and immediate actions during heatwaves; and 3) redesigning the built environment for heat-resilience and to deliver affordable and sustainable cooling.\nSuch an approach provides the scientific basis and justification for vital short and long-term concerted action, including policy and urban planning reforms, and targeted programs to protect the most vulnerable and critical infrastructure.\n## **Objectives**\nThe workshop will provide a platform for knowledge sharing from key stakeholders on best practices and from city officials on actions, measured benefits and implementation challenges. \nThe workshop will establish a platform of key experts and partners to support and refine this standard approach over the proceeding months.\nExperts will discuss the integration of extreme heat and cooling into countries’ climate mitigation and adaptation targets and plans.\n## **Outcomes**\nKnowledge sharing and learnings from the workshop will feed into the global approach being developed for Urban Cooling Action Plan (UCAP), inclusive of guidelines for Urban Heat Vulnerability (UHV) mapping. All participating subnational governments, institutes, cities will be duly acknowledged.\nA global networking platform will be established, for instututes carrying out pioneering work to manage extreme heat along with city case studies sharing action towards heat resilience and sustainable cooling strategies.\n## **Agenda**\n**Welcome and Opening**\n  * **Welcome by the Chair** _Eleni Myrivili_ , Global Chief Heat Officer, UN Habitat and Arsht-Rock\n  * **Opening: UN Secretary General’s Call to Action on Extreme Heat** _Arun Jacob_ , Senior Advisor, Climate Action Team, Executive Office of the UN SG\n  * **Setting the Stage** _Mirey Atallah_ , Chief of Resilience and Adaptation Branch, UNEP\n\n\n**Session 1: Awareness & Preparedness – Urban Heat Mapping, Exposure & Vulnerabilities **Moderator  _Dr. Graeme Maidment_ , Technical Lead Cooling – Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, UK Government\n**Panel Presentations**\n  * _Prof. Rajan Rawal_ , CEPT University\n  * _Dr. Joy Shumake-Guillemot_ , Lead – WHO/WMO Joint Climate and Health Office\n  * _Sanjaya Bhatia_ , Head of Office, UNDRR\n\n\n**Redesign: Using Heat Mapping for Urban Planning**\n  * _Dr. Matthias Roth_ , Professor of Urban Climatology, National University of Singapore\n  * _Tmt.

    "title": "Scaling Smarter Cooling: Inside the Cooling-as-a-Service Model",
    "content": "As global demand for cooling accelerates, so does the need for efficient, equitable, and climate-aligned delivery models. On 2 April 2025, the UNEP Cool Coalition hosted its April session of Cool Talks, the Coalition’s webinar series spotlighting innovative solutions, policies, and partnerships across the sustainable cooling landscape. This edition focused on Cooling-as-a-Service (CaaS), a model that is rapidly gaining traction for its potential to scale low-carbon cooling in diverse sectors and geographies. Organized by the Cool Coalition’s Private Sector Working Group, which is co-led by Danfoss, Metrus Energy, and the Carbon Trust, the webinar brought together leaders in project finance, energy efficiency, and on-the-ground implementation.\n#### **What Is Cooling-as-a-Service?**\nAmr Seleem, Country Engagement and Policy Lead at the UNEP Cool Coalition, opened the session by highlighting the urgency of delivering cooling solutions that do not rely on carbon-intensive systems. “CaaS offers a compelling response by removing upfront capital barriers, aligning business incentives with energy efficiency, and enabling a shift from ownership to service delivery,” he noted.\nIn his keynote address, webinar moderator Bob Hinkle, President and CEO of Metrus Energy, contextualized CaaS within the broader Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) framework, which enables third-party providers to finance, own, and operate energy assets, while customers pay for results. “CaaS unlocks private capital to scale efficient, low-carbon cooling projects that improve air quality and reduce GHG emissions through performance-based contracts,” Hinkle explained.\nRather than purchasing and maintaining equipment, users pay for the cooling they consume, with charges based on installed capacity, ton-hours delivered, or outcomes like indoor air quality or temperature. The model is typically structured through Sustainable Energy Services Agreements (SESAs), which combine engineering, procurement, construction, operation, and maintenance into one integrated contract. This ensures providers remain accountable for system performance and reliability over time.\n#### **Shifting Models, Unlocking Markets**\nFor many organizations under pressure to decarbonize, shifting from capital expenditures (CapEx) to operating expenditures (OpEx) offers strategic advantages. Dimitris Karamitsos, Senior Energy Efficiency Business Developer at the Basel Agency for Sustainable Energy (BASE), emphasized how the CaaS model meets this need. “CaaS allows customers to plan their OpEx with certainty,” he noted. By transferring technical and financial responsibility to service providers, CaaS also mitigates the risks of owning and operating unfamiliar or innovative technologies.\nBringing in the investor’s lens, Shivali Mathur, Associate in Energy Transition at Amberside Advisors, described how the model unlocks both financing and flexibility. “CaaS is like Uber—you don’t own the system, you pay to use it when you need it,” she said. In addition to reducing CapEx burdens for customers, CaaS enables scale, provides predictable revenue streams, and reduces investor risk through standardized long-term contracts. Mathur highlighted key financing structures that are enabling market uptake, including blended finance, joint public-private Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), golden-share arrangements, and green bonds. She also cited the International Finance Corporation’s Scaling Cooling Program and Singapore’s infrastructure bond frameworks as real-world examples of how finance can accelerate cooling transitions.\n#### **From Supermarkets to Smallholders: CaaS in Action**\nCase studies presented during the webinar illustrated the breadth of CaaS applications.\nAndrea Voigt, Head of Global Public Affairs & Communication at Danfoss Climate Solutions, shared two examples from radically different contexts. In Denmark, \nIn Kenya, Danfoss is contributing to the Loss to Value project led by Danish Church Aid, which equips farmer cooperatives with cold rooms through a service-based rather than donation-based model. “We want cooperatives to feel responsible for the equipment and see the long-term benefits,” Voigt noted, while also acknowledging financing barriers when cooperatives lack formal credit profiles.\nRhiannon Turner, Senior Manager for Innovation at the Carbon Trust, presented a portfolio of innovative models tested through grant support. One such initiative is \nAnother Kenyan-led initiative, Drop Access, provides lightweight, solar-powered vaccine refrigeration units called “VaxaBoxes” to health clinics. These are available as a service for just $4 per day, with costs incurred only when in use. “Some clients still view CaaS as a perpetual lease, which makes education and support essential,” Turner said, noting that the early-stage model shows strong promise but also faces structural challenges around pricing and perception.\n#### **Financial Structures and Forward Momentum**\nA robust Q&A segment followed, with high engagement from attendees. Speakers addressed topics including pricing models, capital structuring, and risk mitigation strategies.\nKaramitsos explained that many CaaS providers set up SPVs to isolate financial risk and attract investment. These are typically co-owned by the provider and investor, with shared decision-making.\nMathur added that the United Kingdom (UK market) is currently testing several innovative ownership structures, including co-investment SPVs, golden-share models, and concession-based arrangements. She emphasized that regulatory certainty, like the UK’s recent introduction of heat sector regulations, is helping to crowd in capital.\nEnvironmental considerations were also top of mind. Voigt addressed the role of refrigerants, noting that while using low-global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants is the ultimate goal, the immediate priority in many regions is establishing the cold chain infrastructure itself. “If this can be done with low-GWP refrigerants, that’s ideal,” she said. “But our first responsibility is to ensure systems are in place and used responsibly.”\nHinkle reflected on how the CaaS model connects environmental, technical, and business objectives. “You’re not just avoiding CapEx. You’re aligning outcomes with what the customer really needs; reliability, efficiency, and quality.” Karamitsos added that the model also changes the business incentive for providers. “Instead of profiting from selling spare parts, service providers are incentivized to maximize system performance over time. That’s a shift toward the circular economy.”\nClosing the event, Amr Seleem thanked the panellists and participants for what he described as “a rich and grounded discussion on a model that is still new to the cooling space but full of potential.” He encouraged stakeholders to continue engaging with the Cool Coalition and its partners to drive progress toward sustainable cooling solutions globally.\n**Dive Deeper**\nTo explore the CaaS model further or to join the Cool Coalition’s Private Sector Working Group, go [here](https://coolcoalition.org/about/what-we-do/private-sector-2/).\nTo view the webinar recording and access presentation slides, visit the [event page](https://coolcoalition.org/events/7988/).\nTo watch the March Cool Talk on financing sustainable cooling, go"

    "title": "Cooling Cities Naturally: Experts Highlight Nature’s Role in Beating Urban Heat",
    "content": "Cities around the world are grappling with record-breaking heat. According to a multi-city \nTo turn that promise into financeable reality, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Cool Coalition convened the fourth session of its Cool Talks webinar series, [Cooling with Nature: Financing Nature-Based Solutions in Cities](https://coolcoalition.org/events/cooling-with-nature-financing-nature-based-solutions-in-cities/), on 14 May 2025. The 60-minute event brought together experts in heat resilience, biodiversity policy, architecture, finance and building science to answer a single question: how do we mobilise investment and move from isolated pilots to city-wide deployment of NbS for cooling?\n#### **Financing Cooling Justice**\nOpening the session, Dr Zhuolun Chen, Cool Coalition and NEP Copenhagen Climate Centre (UNEP-CCC) Senior Advisor on Energy Efficiency and Green Finance, framed the scale of the challenge. “Nature-based urban cooling is powerful yet under-utilised,” he said. Investment remains a trickle. UNEP’s \nKeynote speaker Dr Eleni Myrivili, Global Chief Heat Officer at UN-Habitat and the Atlantic Council’s Climate Resilience Center, distilled the stakes: “Cities are ground zero for escalating heat,” she stated, referring to urban heat as a “threat multiplier” that undermines water, food, health and infrastructure systems simultaneously. Citing the latest \n#### **Planning for Vertical Ecosystems**\nModerating the panel, Dr Geronimo Gussmann, Advisor on Nature-based Solutions at the UNEP-CCC, underlined that policy signals now favour NbS. More than half of updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement mention nature-based measures, yet few specify urban cooling. Meanwhile, the Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) commits Parties to expanding green and blue spaces in cities by 2030 (Target 12). “The alignment is there with Paris for climate and the GBF for biodiversity. The next step is to align money and municipal action,” Gussmann stressed. He also advocated blended finance to pull adaptation, biodiversity, and health budgets into single NbS pipelines, and pointed to UNEP-CCC’s \nArchitect Richard Hassell, co-Founder of WOHA, shared a practitioner’s vision of weaving nature into city architecture. Hassell, known for pioneering green building projects in tropical cities, showcased how “urban architecture and passive cooling can go hand-in-hand.” He described a paradigm shift from seeing buildings as isolated boxes to acknowledging them as living parts of the urban ecosystem. “High-rise greenery is not just for the building’s occupants, but performs environmental services for everyone,” Hassell explained. “Plants filter air pollution, provide shade, block out noise, absorb heat, and even create habitats for birds and insects.”. Hassell called for updating building codes and incentives, so that features like green roofs, vegetated facades, courtyards, and permeable, reflective materials become standard practice in development. With successful examples now in place from Singapore to Milan to Bogotá, architects and planners have a growing toolkit to design climate-resilient buildings that stay cool naturally.\nBringing a policy perspective, Eva Gurría, Partnerships Lead at the NBSAP Accelerator, focused on mainstreaming urban NbS through national biodiversity strategies and climate plans. Too often, she noted, countries address heat adaptation in one silo and urban greenery in another. “We need to break silos. Think of urban nature as infrastructure,” she urged. Gurría pointed to London’s natural-capital accounting, where every £1 spent on parks yields £27 in health, environmental and social benefits, all proof that robust valuation can unlock budgets. The Accelerator’s matchmaking facility now links similar city-level cooling proposals with national ministries and financiers, requests already span Antigua and Barbuda to Zimbabwe.\nClosing the panel session, Dr Zahra Jandaghian, Nature-Based Solutions Lead at the National Research Council of Canada’s Construction Research Center, made the engineering case for NbS. Her team’s modelling shows that combinations of reflective cool roofs, increased urban tree canopy, and ventilated street canyons can cut peak temperatures by up to 4 °C, and reduce building energy demand by double digits in Canadian cities. “If we can measure it, we can finance it,” she said. Embedding these measures into building and planning codes will give developers certainty and insurers confidence. Jandaghian sees potential in resilience bonds and green sukuk that reward verified reductions in heat-related mortality or energy consumption, plus public “ecosystem-service payments” for projects that deliver social value beyond property lines.\n#### **Q &A Takeaways**\nThroughout the Q&A, speakers converged on several funding strategies. Climate Policy Initiative’s \nAs Zhuolun Chen concluded, “We have the science, the policy frameworks and a growing roster of success stories. What we need now is coordinated capital and political will. Investing in cooling with nature will lower the thermometer and create healthier, more resilient communities.”\n**Dive Deeper**\nTo view the webinar recording and access presentation slides, visit the [event page](https://coolcoalition.org/events/cooling-with-nature-financing-nature-based-solutions-in-cities/).\nTo watch the April Cool Talk on cooling-as-a-service, go"

    "content": "As the planet warms at an alarming pace, the need for sustainable cooling grows ever more urgent. After 2023 set temperature records, 2024 pushed global heatwaves to new extremes, highlighting how air conditioners and refrigeration, designed to protect people’s health and food supplies, are also driving up emissions and straining energy grids. Without swift intervention, cooling-related emissions could more than double by 2050.\nIn response, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Cool Coalition has launched Cool Talks, a new webinar series that brings together experts, policymakers, and industry leaders to advance solutions for climate-friendly cooling. Its inaugural session, “[The Future of Global Cooling: Insights, Challenges & Priorities](https://coolcoalition.org/events/the-future-of-global-cooling-insights-challenges-priorities/),” convened on 5 March 2025 and assessed progress since the \nModerator Lily Riahi, Global Coordinator of the UNEP Cool Coalition, opened the webinar by underlining the purpose of Cool Talks. “We want to socialize the importance of the cross-cutting work that cooling necessitates, and highlight key lessons, approaches, and ways forward,” she explained. Riahi set the tone by pointing to the crucial role of scientific data in charting pathways to net-zero cooling, referencing the global survey of all 193 UN Member States, a study that underpins the Global Cooling Watch 2023 and forms the backbone of the \nIn the panel discussion, “Getting to Near-Zero Cooling Emissions,” experts reflected on the Global Cooling Watch 2023 and the IFC-UNEP Cool Coalition \nDr. Radhika Khosla, Associate Professor at Oxford University and Research Director at the Oxford India Centre for Sustainable Development, opened the panel discussion by examining the evolving policy landscape for sustainable cooling. Although she acknowledged growing awareness, she highlighted that the issue remains largely absent from national climate agendas. With countries gearing up for their third round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs 3.0), Dr. Khosla insisted that cooling be explicitly integrated to meet broader climate commitments. “We’ve seen momentum, but policies alone are not enough,” she said. “They must be backed by enforcement, investment, and a clear recognition that sustainable cooling is not a side issue, but central to both adaptation and mitigation.”\nBuilding on the policy dimension, Ray Gluckman, Director of Gluckman Consulting—a specialist technical consultancy in climate change mitigation and refrigeration—and a lead author of Global Cooling Watch, spotlighted key findings from the Global Cooling Watch 2023 and underscoring the rapid rise in cooling demand and its associated emissions. He noted that global stocks of cooling equipment are expected to expand by a factor of 2.8 by 2050, but stressed that fully implementing efficiency measures could cut cooling loads by 24%. Despite this potential, Gluckman warned that current policies and market dynamics still fall short of bridging the gap between escalating demand and necessary emissions reductions. “We know near-zero emissions from cooling are possible by 2050,” he said, “but only if governments and industries act decisively now.” Gluckman underscored the need to expedite efficiency improvements, expand passive cooling strategies, and phase down high-GWP refrigerants.\nShifting to a national viewpoint, Hubert Nsoh Zan, Assistant Manager at the Ghana Energy Commission, offered Ghana’s experience with implementing the Global Cooling Pledge, which unites over 70 governments aiming to cut cooling-related emissions by 68% by 2050 through passive cooling, higher appliance efficiency, and a refrigerant transition. He pointed to Ghana’s green public procurement initiative, obligating government agencies to buy high-efficiency cooling appliances, as a crucial step toward market transformation. “Ghana is leading by example, but real progress requires breaking down institutional silos—cooling policy must be mainstreamed across agencies, not left to a single sector,” he said, urging other nations to join the Pledge and harness the forthcoming Global Cooling Watch 2025 for guidance.\nBringing a financial lens to the conversation, Rusmir Musić, Global Cooling Lead at the International Finance Corporation (IFC), zoomed in on the US$600 billion annual investment opportunity in sustainable cooling by 2050, as projected by the IFC-UNEP Cool Coalition Cooler Finance report. He stressed that while private finance is crucial, it relies on robust national policies and market frameworks to thrive. Citing case studies from Africa and East and South Asia, Musić explained how aligning regulations with financial incentives accelerates investment in efficient cooling solutions. “Cooling success depends on integrating finance, policy, and technology to create the right enabling environment,” he remarked. Yet, high upfront costs remain a persistent hurdle for SMEs and smallholder farmers, necessitating business models such as cooling-as-a-service, results-based financing, and risk-sharing mechanisms.\nOmar Abdelaziz, Assistant Professor at the American University in Cairo, concluded the panel discussion by emphasizing the need for robust metrics to track global cooling commitments effectively. An internationally recognized expert in sustainable cooling technology and policy, and a lead author of the Global Cooling Watch report, he outlined the methodologies behind both the Global Cooling Watch and the [Global Cooling Pledge Progress Report](https://coolcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Global-Cooling-Pledge-Progress-Report.pdf), stressing the necessity of combining quantitative and qualitative data—surveys, industry reports, and policy analysis. Abdelaziz cautioned that inconsistencies in how cooling regulations are interpreted can lead to unreliable data. “Without standardized metrics and transparency, we risk making pledges without real accountability,” he noted, calling for stronger validation processes and stakeholder engagement to ensure accurate progress tracking.\nDuring the Q&A, panelists addressed these financial hurdles in more detail, spotlighting on-bill financing and pay-as-you-go approaches to help consumers manage the costs of efficient cooling systems. They also called for phasing out electricity subsidies that undercut market incentives, arguing that realigning pricing structures can make climate-friendly cooling more accessible, especially in resource-constrained regions.\nClosing the session, Axum Teferra, Senior Associate Director at Clean Cooling Collaborative and a member of the Cool Coalition Executive Committee, reiterated the need for wide-ranging cooperation among governments, businesses, and researchers. She emphasized the crucial role the Global Cooling Watch 2025 will play in guiding future steps and invited experts to contribute. “Achieving near-zero cooling emissions is not just about technology—it requires a coordinated, multi-stakeholder effort that ensures policies are implemented, financing is mobilized, and solutions reach those who need them most,” she said. Teferra also hailed Ghana’s leadership as a blueprint for turning pledges into concrete action.\nThe Cool Talks series continues on 20 March 2025 with “"

In his \nDuring the Summit, the UNEP Cool Coalition presented its Urban Heat Island Effect Study for Chennai, Tamil Nadu’s capital, which identifies how urbanization is driving temperature increases and pinpoints neighborhoods where targeted cooling interventions are most critical. This data-driven analysis underpins the state’s evolving climate resilience strategies, spotlighting the role of energy efficiency, green infrastructure, and nature-based solutions in mitigating heat.\nThe UNEP Cool Coalition also showcased passive cooling measures—non-mechanical, design-focused techniques, supplemented by nature-based solutions, that reduce energy consumption and reliance on traditional air-conditioning. [Cambodia](https://coolcoalition.org/pilot-projects/passive-cooling-in-cambodia/)’s success in scaling passive cooling in rapidly growing cities served as a key illustration. Another highlight was a district cooling demonstration, developed with Tabreed, a global leader in district cooling and a key UNEP Cool Coalition partner. District cooling delivers chilled water to multiple buildings through insulated pipelines, substantially lowering electricity usage and emissions compared to standalone systems. To foster further adoption, the UNEP Cool Coalition has established a District Cooling Hub in India, offering policy guidance, technology transfers, and capacity-building support.\nAn interactive cooling cities game at the exhibit engaged policymakers, students, and community members in exploring different cooling strategies and their respective impacts. The stall attracted significant interest in the Urban Heat Island Effect study and the UNEP Cool Coalition’s broader efforts, including an emerging partnership between Tabreed and the International Finance Corporation. Over the next five years, the partnership aims to deploy 100,000 TR (tons of refrigeration) of new cooling capacity across India.\nWith a growing portfolio of initiatives in the region, the UNEP Cool Coalition remains focused on expanding district cooling networks, enhancing cold-chain infrastructure, and championing passive cooling within urban resilience plans. By collaborating with governments, private-sector leaders, and financial institutions, the UNEP Cool Coalition is helping India develop and scale sustainable cooling solutions that protect communities, bolster economies, and soften the impacts of a warming climate."

    "content": "On 16 January 2025, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Regional Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (RCREEE) convened the inaugural meeting of the Regional Technical Advisory Group on National Cooling Action Plans (NCAPs) in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Held under the framework of the UNEP Cool Coalition, the meeting marked a critical step toward fostering climate-friendly cooling policies tailored to regional needs.\nWith over 12 countries joining the Advisory Group, the initiative underscores a growing commitment across MENA to advance sustainable cooling solutions. By leveraging policy innovation, capacity building, and knowledge exchange, the group aims to integrate efficient, low-emission cooling strategies into national frameworks. This effort is supported by the Climate & Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) and aligns with global climate goals to cut emissions and build resilience against rising temperatures.\nAt the heart of this collaboration is the development of NCAPs, comprehensive national strategies that will drive transformative action in the cooling sector. The initiative is structured around three key objectives: catalyzing policy transformation by embedding sustainable cooling into national climate plans, strengthening regional capacities through tailored methodologies, and conducting in-depth sectoral analyses to identify best practices and technological pathways. Two pilot countries will lead the way in implementing the NCAPs, offering a model for broader adoption across the region.\nThe meeting fostered high-level discussions on the regional cooling landscape, challenges, and opportunities, with participants reaffirming their commitment to NCAPs as a key instrument for sustainable cooling governance. Discussions highlighted the need to scale up Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) and labeling policies through a harmonized regional approach, ensuring that energy efficiency becomes a cornerstone of cooling sector development. Participants also emphasized the importance of bridging implementation gaps by leveraging MENA’s potential in cutting-edge cooling technologies, including passive cooling strategies, enhanced energy efficiency measures, and the transition to low-GWP refrigerants.\nThe Advisory Group also identified the need for concrete, actionable steps to translate policy into practice. Training programs and knowledge-sharing initiatives will play a pivotal role in equipping stakeholders with the expertise to develop and implement effective NCAPs. Through strengthened collaboration and a commitment to innovation, the Advisory Group is set to guide the region toward a more sustainable, climate-resilient cooling future."

    "content": "As urban areas across Southeast Asia contend with rising temperatures, denser skylines, and shrinking green spaces, the ASEAN countries has launched a coordinated drive to scale up low-emission cooling solutions that safeguard both public health, economic productivity and environmental sustainability.\nOn 30 June 2025, the ASEAN Passive Cooling Advisory Group held its inaugural meeting, co-convened by the ASEAN Centre for Energy (ACE) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Cool Coalition. This session opened work on a Regional Roadmap for Passive Cooling Strategies (PCS) that aims to curb reliance on energy-intensive air conditioning, strengthen resilience to extreme heat, and broaden access to thermal comfort, especially for vulnerable communities. The “ASEAN Passive Cooling Strategies Roadmap – An Inclusive Heat Resilience Approach” is being developed jointly by UNEP Cool Coalition and ACE in partnership with UN Women, United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN ESCAP), Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (GABC), and UNEP’s EmPower Program.\nPassive cooling measures include natural and cross-ventilation, high-albedo surfaces, shading, nature-based solutions, and climate-responsive architecture. Although such techniques can sharply lower indoor and outdoor temperatures, they remain underused in Southeast Asia. Recent research efforts by Cool Coalition members in the Asia-Pacific region including UNEP, ESCAP, ACE, Global Green Growth Institutes have found that widespread adoption of passive cooling strategies could significantly reduce energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in residential and commercial buildings.\nThe Advisory Group brings together national authorities from ASEAN member states, development partners including UN ESCAP, UN Women, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC), Clean Cooling Collaborative and other Industry and Academic experts. It will provide technical and strategic guidance for the Roadmap, aligning with regional action with the [Global Cooling Pledge](https://coolcoalition.org/global-cooling-pledge/), the Declaration of Chaillot, and the ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation.\nParticipants endorsed the group’s Terms of Reference and confirmed its leadership. Dr Daniel Collin G. Jornales from the Philippines, Chair of the ASEAN Working Group on Buildings, will serve as Chair, with Professor Tetsu Kubota of Hiroshima University as co-Chair.\nThe roadmap will apply a region-specific, evidence-based approach. It will promote the integration of passive cooling into building codes, national energy strategies, and climate adaptation plans. A series of consultations, webinars, and workshops will ensure broad engagement across sectors and member states. The group will also identify policy gaps, coordinate data collection, and catalyse finance and partnerships to accelerate implementation.\nTo inform this work, a \nThe Advisory Group will reconvene regularly through 2025 to review progress and refine the roadmap, laying the foundation for inclusive, climate-resilient development across Southeast Asia.\nFor more information, contact"

    "content": "Cold chains have long hummed in the background of food markets and vaccine clinics, but as heatwaves intensify, they are stepping into the spotlight. On 30 July 2025, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Cool Coalition convened _Cold Chains for a Hot Planet: Cooling for Resilient Food and Health Systems_ , a Cool Talks webinar held alongside \nModerator Angshuman Siddhanta, Sustainable Cold Chain Expert at the UNEP Cool Coalition, opened the event referring to cold chains as “critical infrastructure for development, climate and equity.” He pointed to the Coalition’s recent work in India as a powerful blueprint for climate change through sustainable cold chains. These initiatives include a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Haryana to develop a renewable-powered state cold-chain system, and a [net-zero packhouse programme in Bihar](https://coolcoalition.org/workshop-on-accelerating-climate-friendly-and-integrated-cold-chain-development-for-agriculture-in-india/) that is helping farmers reduce losses and raise incomes. “We lose 12 percent of all food grown each year for lack of reliable refrigeration,” he said. “That is a climate and development crisis we can fix.”\nMaricel Castro, Technical Officer for Vaccine Supply Chain and Logistics at the World Health Organization, referred to cold chains as “strategic lifelines.” She detailed how solar direct-drive refrigerators have transformed vaccine delivery in countries like Niger, reducing outages and wastage while expanding immunization services. “We are protecting far more than vaccines. We are protecting lives,” she stated. Castro remarked that, through the Gavi Cold Chain Equipment Optimisation Platform, more than 40,000 units have been deployed, reducing outages and wastage.\nTransitioning from health to food systems, Ioannis Vaskalis, Natural Resources Officer at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), explained how sustainable cold chains can unlock zero hunger goals. He showcased FAO’s work in Jordan, Morocco, and Tunisia, where renewable-powered cold storage is reducing post-harvest losses and strengthening market access for smallholder farmers. “Over 526 million tonnes of food are lost each year due to inadequate refrigeration,” he noted. “Solar-driven cold chains can turn that waste into nutrition, income and climate progress.” Vaskalis also referenced FAO’s work to develop dairy cold chains in East Africa.\nWith the policy context set by the opening keynotes, the panel discussion turned to technological innovation. Roberta Evangelista, Senior Digitalization Specialist at the BASE Foundation, introduced the \nFrom digital tools, the focus moved to energy storage. Vishnu Sasidharan, Vice President and Business Head of Climate Technologies at Pluss Advanced Technologies, explained how phase-change materials (PCMs) act as thermal batteries, enabling cold rooms to operate efficiently even in off-grid areas. “By integrating PCMs, we can bridge the gap between intermittent renewable energy and 24/7 cooling,” Vishnu explained. He highlighted an 80-tonne PCM-equipped solar cold room in Odisha, India, run by a women’s self-help group, which provides reliable cooling to local farmers while eliminating diesel dependence.\nDanfoss Vice President of Industrial Refrigeration Anatoly Mikhailov focused on the importance of efficiency, demonstrating how combining high-efficiency equipment with natural refrigerants, such as ammonia and CO₂, can reduce warehouse energy use by 10–20 percent, high-global warming potential (GWP) F-gases. “This is about economics, as much as technology,” Mikhailov said. “With payback periods often under three years, efficiency and natural refrigerants represent the fastest, most cost-effective path to scaling climate-friendly cold chains.”\nBringing the discussion back to implementation, Guntram Glasbrenner, Programme Manager at GIZ Proklima International, shared results from solar-powered cold chain projects in \nThe subsequent Q&A session drilled into real-world challenges. Participants asked how to prevent cold rooms from sitting idle, with panellists stressing the importance of right-sizing facilities and linking them to local business models. Financing questions dominated the chat, with speakers pointing to pay-per-use models and public-private collaboration as emerging solutions. When asked about passive cooling innovations for remote sites, panellists noted the role of PCM-equipped vaccine carriers in bridging last-mile gaps.\nIn his closing remarks, Siddhanta tied the conversation together. “Cold chains have shifted from background logistics to a frontline adaptation tool,” he stated. “They decide whether farmers prosper, vaccines reach those who need them, and emissions come down. The task ahead is to scale what works and ensure these solutions reach every community that needs them.”\nMore on the event, including speaker presentations and the recording [here](https://coolcoalition.org/events/cold-chains-for-a-hot-planet-cooling-for-resilient-food-and-health-systems/)."

    "content": "# Development for Agriculture in India\nBihar, a state of East India, struggles to leverage its high and diverse horticultural production due to underdeveloped cold-chain infrastructure, inadequate processing facilities, poor road connectivity, extreme weather, unreliable power, and limited marketing. A United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy (AEEE) analysis estimates that approximately 2 to 4 million tonnes of fruits and vegetables are lost post-harvest annually, generating 5 to 10 MtCO2.eq emissions in the state. With fewer than 30 packhouses available against the required 2,205 (as per National Centre for Cold-Chain Development), Bihar’s lack of integrated cold-chain infrastructure hampers rural economic growth resulting in food loss and emissions.\nTo accelerate the adoption of a sustainable, energy-efficient, and integrated horticulture cold chain with renewable energy integration, UNEP and AEEE, under its India Cold Chain Programme (ICCP), with support from the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), organized a capacity-building and awareness workshop on the “Scaling-up Investments in Clean and Efficient Cold-chain in India with a focus on integrated packhouse development in Bihar” on 13 December in Patna.\nThe workshop supports Bihar’s Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development Pathway that aims to establish a future characterized by low-carbon practices and building climate resilience of its people and systems while promoting sustainable growth.\n“There is an urgent need for Bihar to capitalize on its diverse horticultural production and expand its reach to global consumers through integrated cold-chain,” said Anubha Prasad, SIDBI General Manager. “The quality of agricultural produce in Bihar is unmatched, presenting the state with significant business opportunities to export fruits and vegetables globally. We need to rapidly scale up investments in robust cold-chain infrastructure especially in first-mile packhouse with reefer transport and extend support to farmers and MSMEs to drive sustainable economic growth while reducing food loss and emissions.”\nMadhavendra Kumar Thakur, Chairman at Mithila Vegetable Processing and Marketing Cooperative Union Ltd., Darbhanga, Bihar thanked UNEP and AEEE for conducting the training workshop. “Bridging the farm to fork cold-chain gap is extremely crucial for Bihar to become a global model in sustainable horticulture sector. By creating rural packhouses adopting energy-efficient, renewables and climate-friendly solutions, we can enhance nutritional security, boost rural livelihoods, and align Bihar’s growth with low-carbon development goals and with ICCP support, we will be demonstrating a sustainable packhouse in Darbhanga,” he stated.\nRepresentatives from UNEP and AEEE delivered training sessions that highlighted the need for integrated packhouses in Bihar, packhouse functions & processes, site selection criteria for packhouses, and steps to design a climate-friendly packhouse with energy efficient and renewable energy technologies, and good practices for cold-chain handling and post- harvest management for Litchi and Mango grown in Bihar. They also shared business models, state-specific financing mechanism, procurement guidelines and various government schemes available for cold-chain packhouse development. Additionally, SIDBI also presented on its Green Finance scheme enabling integration of sustainable technologies in cold-chain.\nMore than 50 participants attended the workshop demonstrating the commitment to build a resilient and sustainable cold-chain infrastructure in Bihar. The workshop enabled participants to explore innovative business models and effective procurement processes for the construction and operation of packhouses. It provided valuable insights into existing Central and State Government financial assistance for developing cold chain infrastructure in Bihar. The training workshop also focused on strengthened collaboration and coordination among departments and organizations, promoting a more integrated and strategic approach to cold-chain development and implementation in the state.\nMoving forward, UNEP and AEEE will focus on opportunities for providing policy support to accelerate cold chain development in Bihar and in parallel to ongoing packhouse demonstration being developed under ICCP also prioritize developing a pipeline of packhouse projects with state governments support to address the existing cold-chain gap. This approach aims to build a more market-linked, resilient and efficient horticultural supply chain in the state."

By translating national and international commitments into practical, cross-sectoral measures across food systems, healthcare, housing, and energy, NCAPs empower governments to drive emissions reductions, bolster resilience, and improve public health.\nTo advance this agenda, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Cool Coalition and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) co-convened a high-level side event at the , on 9 July 2025, in Bangkok, Thailand. [National Cooling Action Plans: Building Regional Synergies to Accelerate Implementation](https://coolcoalition.org/events/national-cooling-action-plans-building-regional-synergies-to-accelerate-implementation/) focused on how regional harmonization and improved access to finance can accelerate NCAP uptake.\nSetting the stage, Mozaharul Alam, Regional Coordinator for Climate Action at UNEP Asia-Pacific Office, welcomed participants and emphasized the need to move from commitment to implementation through robust mechanisms and cross-sectoral coordination. He underscored that NCAPs, anchored in strong institutional frameworks, are key to helping countries deliver on the Kigali Amendment, their NDCs, and the [Global Cooling Pledge](https://coolcoalition.org/global-cooling-pledge/), while supporting broader development and climate priorities.\nExcellency Eunice Biritwum, Acting Executive Secretary of Ghana’s Energy Commission, reinforced this message by highlighting Ghana’s leadership in sustainable cooling. In her opening address, she spoke to the country’s commitment to the Global Cooling Pledge, the central role of NCAPs, and the importance of aligning cooling action with both national development and climate objectives.\nFollowing the opening remarks, attention turned to regional innovation in NCAP development. Dr Omar Abdelaziz, Regional Expert, UNEP Cool Coalition, presented a technical overview of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regional NCAP methodology. Dr Abdelaziz outlined how a harmonized approach across countries can accelerate the development and implementation of NCAPs, emphasizing the potential of regional cooperation to scale up sustainable cooling solutions and achieve both climate and development objectives.\nThe panel discussion, moderated by Denise San Valentin, Programme Management Officer at the Climate and Clean Air Coalition and Manjeet Singh, Senior Project Specialist at the UNEP Cool Coalition, brought together national leaders and development partners to explore practical strategies for advancing NCAPs across regions.\nLe Ngoc Tuan, Deputy Director General at Viet Nam’s Department of Climate Change, discussed how Viet Nam’s NCAP is designed to deliver on both Kigali Implementation Plans and enhanced NDCs, while pursuing new avenues for implementation finance. He noted that several important legal documents have recently been adopted, including a decree that formally recognizes the cooling sector within Viet Nam’s national policy framework. Through strengthened inter-ministerial coordination and innovative business models such as Cooling-as-a-Service, the NCAP is facilitating the adoption of climate-friendly cooling technologies and improved refrigerant management.\nJanati Idrissi Rabia, National Ozone Officer at Morocco’s Ministry of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, reflected on Morocco’s journey from refrigerant transition to developing its first NCAP, with an emphasis on cross-sectoral coordination and future cooling strategies.\nFrom Japan, Makoto Kato, Senior Researcher at the Overseas Environmental Cooperation Center highlighted efforts to create synergies between climate change and refrigerant commitments, sharing policy lessons that could inform other countries’ approaches. \nBalaji Natrajan, Programme Management Officer at the Multilateral Fund Secretariat, considered the evolving role of the Fund in supporting NCAPs and discussed how countries can leverage these plans to access additional resources and support aligned with KIPs.\nJie Pan, Regional Technical Advisor at UNDP, provided insights on facilitating inter-ministerial collaboration in NCAP design and highlighted enabling conditions for successful implementation.\nNils Hansen, Project Manager at GIZ Proklima, discussed the holistic potential of NCAPs in accelerating energy-efficient, climate-friendly cooling solutions, and outlined findings from the NDC Cooling Guide on integrating cooling into national climate plans.\nThroughout the discussion, panellists remarked on the need for strong institutional coordination, innovative financing, and robust regional knowledge exchange to transform planning into real-world results. The discussion underscored that scaling sustainable cooling depends on adaptive approaches and strengthened partnerships across countries and sectors.\nIn closing, Manjeet Singh noted that NCAPs are increasingly serving as the linchpin connecting national cooling strategies and regional approaches, such as the MENA NCAP methodology, that enable valuable peer learning. \nThe momentum from OEWG-47 is set to propel even greater collaboration and action, with over 40 countries now developing or implementing NCAPs under the Global Cooling Pledge. As the Montreal Protocol community shapes the future of ozone and climate protection, NCAPs are ensuring that sustainable cooling becomes an accessible and central pillar of climate-resilient development.\nFor more information, contact"

    "content": "As rising temperatures push cities beyond the limits of infrastructure, health systems, and public safety nets, the world is running out of time to adapt. No longer a seasonal spike, extreme heat has become a structural threat, and one of the clearest signs that climate change is reshaping everyday life. From food supply chains to school calendars, heatwaves are already straining systems built for a cooler world.\nAt the 80th United Nations General Assembly Climate Action Summit (UNGA80), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), through its Cool Coalition, and the COP30 Brazilian Presidency introduced [Beat the Heat](https://coolcoalition.org/pilot-projects/beat-the-heat-in-cities/), a new global implementation drive to help countries turn national cooling commitments into practical, locally driven action.\nThe initiative builds on the momentum of the [Global Cooling Pledge](https://coolcoalition.org/global-cooling-pledge/), the world’s first collective commitment to reduce cooling-related emissions by 68 percent by 2050 while expanding equitable access to sustainable cooling. Endorsed by more than 70 countries and 80 non-state actors, the Pledge provides a targeted roadmap to meet growing sustainable cooling demand. While rooted in the Pledge, Beat the Heat is open to all countries striving to foster sustainable cooling. It offers a platform to bring national targets to life, particularly in fast-growing urban areas, where infrastructure and planning systems are already under strain.\nAt the [High-Level Solutions Dialogue on Accelerating Early Warning and Extreme Heat Solutions](https://coolcoalition.org/events/high-level-solutions-dialogue-on-accelerating-early-warning-and-extreme-heat-solutions/), UNEP New York Director Ligia Noronha and COP30 Executive Director Ana Toni invited countries to nominate one or more cities to participate in the initiative. From there, the drive will offer a structured framework for action: conducting urban heat risk assessments; scaling up passive and nature-based cooling solutions, such as green corridors and reflective surfaces; embedding cooling into building codes and urban plans; and using public procurement to shift markets toward efficient, low-emission cooling technologies. The focus is on practical delivery, peer exchange, and connecting local ambition to national strategy.\nThe UNGA80 announcement marks the opening of the global call for participation, building on the initiative’s announcement at the inaugural [Global Cooling Pledge Focal Points Signatories Meeting](https://coolcoalition.org/1st-global-cooling-pledge-focal-points-meeting/) in Bonn earlier this year. The first wave of participating countries and cities will be formally launched and presented at COP30 during the Delivering on the Global Cooling Pledge Ministerial Dialogue at the 2025 UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, scheduled for 11 November 2025.\nThis is an opportunity for countries to demonstrate leadership in delivering climate ambition, and a timely chance to protect lives, economies, and the future of cities in a world that is heating up fast. **Governments and partners can now express their interest****.**"

As temperatures rise from climate change, extreme heat is becoming a major risk to health, productivity, and sustainable development across Africa. The region is projected to experience some of the highest increases in heat exposure globally. Africa bears a disproportionate burden of heat stress. About 300 million people in Africa experienced life threatening heat stress in the last one year; this is about 75% of all people exposed to risky levels of heat globally. 1 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Chage predicts nearly 35 African cities can experience more than 150 days of 40 °C plus temperatures annually in case of a 2°C global warming scenario. Rapid urbanization without appropriate urban planning is aggravating climate change in cities induced heat through urban heat islands caused from of natural blue-green covers so crucial for avoiding higher temperatures. Africa is witnessing the fastest population growth globally with corresponding high nutritional needs and agriculture sector is a dominant contributor to national gross domestic products. Rising heat is also disrupting crop yields and weakening vaccine supply; the ensuing threats to farmer incomes, and, food and nutritional security will have wider negative implications for equitable economic growth. \nExtreme heat is additionally driving an unprecedented demand for energy as people race to invest in electrical cooling systems for relief. According to , Africa is projected to experience among the fastest growth in cooling demand globally, with inefficient cooling at risk of placing heavy burdens on energy systems and household expenditures. Rising and sustained heat in the African continent is thus risking livelihoods, health, and productivity. This can result in deeper inequality, strained energy systems, and dilution of hard-won development gains.\nThis **Technical Side Event****on Dialogue on Sustainable Cooling in Cities, Buildings and Cold Chain for Inclusive Extreme Heat Adaptation in Africa** at the 20th Ordinary Session of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN-20), will showcase sustainable cooling, specifically passive cooling strategies in buildings and efficient cold chain, for extreme heat adaptation, implemented successfully in India and South-east Asia by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). Dialogue within AMCEN 20 will aid in exploring pathways for adoption and scaling of such approaches in the African continent to address its unique climate, urban, and institutional realities.\nPassive cooling, achieved through climate-responsive building architecture, enhance indoor thermal comfort by decreasing temperatures by upto 3-4 °C and reduce cooling energy demand by about 30 percent in buildings. Urban heat island effects (UHIE) and heat waves are also mitigated through intelligent integration in urban spaces. It becomes more critical in geographies where access to electrical cooling is restricted because of nascent markets or low purchasing power. UNEP’s [Cool Coalition](https://coolcoalition.org/), the  and  are partnering to implement BeCool project in India to advance policies, finance, and capacities for passive cooling. It has resulted in successful national and sub-national action on building regulations and real estate sector capacity building for passive cooling, and, heat resilient city planning to mitigate UHIE. The Cool Coalition is also partnering with government and private sector to update policies, technical standards, and private sector capacities for integrating energy efficient and renewable energy technologies in cold chain infrastructure. \n**UNEP convened Cool Coalition** is supporting African governments and institutions through a unique platform for technical cooperation, knowledge-exchange, and implementation support. With more than 250 partners, including national governments, financial institutions, cities, and the private sector, the Cool Coalition catalyzes technology and finance innovation, policy exchange and coordinated technical assistance for, sustainable cooling that work across diverse contexts.\n**UNEP led GlobalABC** is the leading global platform for governments, private sector, civil society, research, and intergovernmental organizations committed to a common vision: _A zero-emission, efficient and resilient buildings, and construction sector_. Key initiatives include the Intergovernmental Council for Buildings and Climate (ICBC), now with 47 members and 17 observers, hosted by UNEP/GlobalABC. ICBC aligns reforms, shares policies, and scales proven solutions, fostering collaboration among countries. GlobalABC also hosts the Buildings Breakthrough (BBT), a technical coalition of front-runner countries and partners working to make near-zero emission and resilient buildings the global norm by 2030.\nUNEP convened Cool Coalition is supporting African governments and institutions through a unique platform for technical cooperation, knowledge-exchange, and implementation support.
