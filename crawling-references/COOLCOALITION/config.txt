###  13–14 June 2025 Bonn, Germany
### **Background**
Launched at COP28, the [Global Cooling Pledge](https://coolcoalition.org/global-cooling-pledge/), addresses extreme heat risks and sustainable cooling demand through a triple strategy: passive cooling, super-efficient technologies, and climate-friendly refrigerants to cut sectoral emissions by 68% by 2050. Reinforced at COP29’s inaugural Annual Cooling Ministerial Meeting, the Pledge 
At COP29, the[ Annual Cooling Ministerial](https://coolcoalition.org/cop29-ministerial-roundtable-delivering-on-the-global-cooling-pledge/) on the Global Cooling Pledge marked a milestone in global cooling efforts. Co-Chaired by Her Excellency Ana Toni, CEO of COP30, and Her Excellency Dr. Amna bint Abdullah Al Dahak Minister of Climate Change and Environment of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the [2024 Pledge Progress Report](https://coolcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Global-Cooling-Pledge-Progress-Report.pdf) and 2030 Implementation Strategy, alongside the formal announcement of plans to develop an Intergovernmental Committee on Cooling (IGCC). Leaders shared their progress, reaffirmed commitment, and emphasized the need for accelerated action, collaboration, and increased support for developing countries; “as the host of COP30, we see the Pledge as an opportunity to elevate sustainable cooling in response to extreme heat and ensure it remains a key priority for climate action in both mitigation and adaptation efforts” said Ana Toni.
The first Global Cooling Pledge Signatories Focal Points Meeting, co-hosted by the Governments of Germany, Italy, and the UAE, co-chaired by Brazil and the UAE, will provide a dedicated platform to delve into the practicalities of Pledge implementation, shape the Intergovernmental Committee on Cooling to ensure broader inclusivity and support for all Signatory countries, and prepare for COP30 potential outcomes, including Cooling Pledge Ministerial. It will also deliver targeted technical training and capacity-building activities identified through the Needs Assessment with Signatories.
