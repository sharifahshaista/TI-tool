https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/methane/state-landfill-emissions-rules,States lead on landfill methane emissions as federal action stalls,3 April 2025,Isobel Whitcomb,"The EPA was set to tighten rules on landfill operators. With Trump in charge, state policies may be the nation’s best bet at curbing these emissions. 
Landfills are a major problem for the climate: They’re the United States’ third-largest source of methane, a greenhouse gas that traps 80 times as much heat as carbon dioxide in the short term. Last year, the federal government was poised to start reining in these emissions: In July, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it would [release new regulations](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/methane/is-the-epa-about-to-get-serious-about-methane-pollution-from-landfills) to better detect and prevent methane leaks from landfills.
The Trump administration, which has announced its intention to 65% or more, seems unlikely to follow through on these plans or any other policy limiting landfill emissions.
But in the absence of federal leadership, states like Michigan, Oregon, Colorado, and California are moving forward with their own plans. Regulatory efforts are underway among these climate leaders to implement stricter rules for landfill operators and require the use of novel technology, like drones and satellites that monitor leaks.
“These state regulations could be hugely impactful,” said Elizabeth Schroeder, the senior communications strategist at Industrious Labs, a nonprofit working to transform heavy industry. They not only have the potential to make a real dent on greenhouse gas emissions, Schroeder said, but could also set a national example for other states looking to curtail methane pollution.
## **How states can step up regulation on landfills**
Currently, the EPA requires landfill operators to cover trash to minimize odor, disease risk, and fire — a practice that also minimizes methane leaks. This usually looks like a layer of dirt or ash, followed by tarps. Operators of large landfills must also install extraction systems, networks of pipes that collect methane and other gases from inside the landfill. The extraction systems then pump these emissions to burn off at flares or, increasingly, to biogas energy projects. However, landfills are dynamic systems — over time, as waste breaks down and shifts, cover develops holes and pipes crack.
Maintenance is often imperfect. An analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund found that between 2021 and 2023, more than one-third of landfills had “walking” surveys for leaks. But experts say that these surveys are infrequent and often miss large portions of the landfill.
States have an opportunity to step up those standards — not only by lowering emissions limits but by improving the maintenance and monitoring of landfills, said Tom Frankiewicz, the waste-sector methane expert at climate-focused think tank RMI. “While we would love to see all this done comprehensively in one national-level regulation, it’s states that are taking the lead on deployment of advanced technology and setting new best practices for landfills.”
In 2010, California became the first state to develop standards for landfills that were stricter than federal rules. Those included a lower emissions threshold at which landfills had to install gas collection systems and a requirement that operators enclose flares so that the methane burns more efficiently. Other states, including Oregon and Washington, followed suit and in some respects even surpassed California, said Katherine Blauvelt, the circular-economy director for Industrious Labs. But despite this early progress, landfills in these states and elsewhere continue to spew methane and undermine climate goals.
Now, though, Colorado has taken the lead on a new generation of landfill emissions regulations. The state is developing what some experts are calling a first-of-a-kind program for monitoring and [responding to methane leaks from landfills](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/methane/colorado-launches-first-of-a-kind-landfill-methane-monitoring-program). As part of the initiative, Colorado plans to implement remote-sensing technologies, including fly-overs and satellites, to detect methane leaks, which operators would then be required to address.
“Colorado would be the first state to incorporate that into a rule where, instead of relying on voluntary follow-up, there would actually be requirements around mitigating emissions that are detected,” said Ellie Garland, a senior associate focusing on methane policy at RMI. A draft rule will be publicly available in April, with a final vote expected in August.
In addition, Colorado’s Department of Public Health and Environment is considering additional requirements for landfills that include stricter rules for the maintenance of cover and a lower threshold at which landfills are required to report and control emissions, Garland said. Currently only 15 of the state’s about 50 active landfills do this, although Colorado began requiring 35 more landfills to begin reporting emissions starting on March 31, said Clay Clarke, the manager of the climate change program at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Not all landfills are required to control emissions. That’s because smaller landfills don’t generate enough gas to collect and flare. Under proposed regulations, many of these landfills would need to pipe gas to biofilters — a system that uses microorganisms to digest methane.
Meanwhile, the California Air Resources Board is working to update its landfill emissions regulations. Under CARB’s anticipated timeline, these will take effect in 2027. Last December, the agency held a workshop to discuss potential new rules. Those included a lower safe limit for methane emissions, limits on how long operators can turn off their gas collection systems for landfill maintenance, and stricter rules for collecting gas at closed landfills. Under current regulations, landfill operators must collect gas for only 15 years after a landfill closes even though the area can 30 years or more. The agency is also considering regulations that would require some operators to [install automated well-tuning technology](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/methane/this-automated-tool-helps-tackle-methane-emissions-from-landfills) that monitors and adjusts the gas-extraction system in real time.
One of the most promising new regulations CARB is considering is a “super-emitter” program for landfills, Blauvelt said. The EPA defines a super-emitter event as a plume of methane leaking at a rate of more than 100 kilograms per hour. In 2019, NASA scientists estimated that these highly concentrated leaks account for one-third of 
Between 2020 and 2023, CARB partnered with the University of Arizona and the nonprofit Carbon Mapper to track down super-emitter events by flying over landfills in planes equipped with sensors that can detect methane plumes. If Carbon Mapper identified a leak, it notified CARB, which would get in touch with the landfill owner. However, operators weren’t required to take action. Later analyses found that operators fixed about half of the reported leaks.
Updated rules could require landfill operators to swiftly respond to methane plumes. The program would be similar to the super-emitter program already in place for California’s oil and gas industry. That program requires operators to follow up with on-the-ground monitoring within five days of learning about a leak, come up with a repair plan 72 hours later, and fix the leak within two to 14 calendar days, depending on its severity.
The state is also looking into other remote-sensing technologies, like drones and on-the-ground infrared monitors, which would provide a more continuous and finer-resolution picture of methane emissions.
California emits the second largest share of greenhouse gases in the U.S. A recent Industrious Labs analysis found that if the state were to adopt these stricter regulations, it could 22% by 2030 and 64% by the end of the century.
## **Will more states invest in methane-monitoring?**
Other states are renewing their efforts, too. In Oregon, newly proposed Senate Bill 726 would 
Meanwhile, in Michigan, a climate bill passed in 2023 contains elements that could lead to landfills adopting better monitoring and detection. Senate Bill 271, which aims to accelerate the state’s transition to clean energy, identifies landfill biogas as a potential low-carbon fuel. “While the inclusion of recovered landfill gas as a clean energy source has come under scrutiny, there is a major silver lining,” Blauvelt wrote in an email. “Vital” language in the bill mandates that landfill operators collecting biogas use “best practices for methane gas collection and control,” as determined by Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.
The department has yet to lay out what those “best practices” are, but better landfill cover, automated well-tuning technology, and advanced monitoring technology are all on the table, Blauvelt said.
“Given that Michigan is among the top ten states for methane emission from landfills, the potential to dramatically reduce methane and other harmful co-pollutants is enormous,” Blauvelt wrote in an email. 
A 2024 analysis by Industrious Labs projected that if every state were to adopt these best practices, it could lead to a 2050. Experts hope that as these climate leaders adopt stricter rules, more states will step up. In 2010, California showed that this ripple effect is possible, Blauvelt said. “The great news about this is, the solutions are known. The technology is sitting on the shelf.”","Methane, Emissions reduction, Policy regulation",state-landfill-emissions-rules.md,articles_methane

The Trump administration is expected to use a controversial Energy Department report to justify keeping costly fossil-fueled power plants online past their retirement dates. But nine state attorneys general and several clean-energy industry groups are demanding the agency fix the document’s heavily criticized methodology.
The report, which found that the country will face a hundredfold increase in grid blackout risks absent extraordinary federal intervention, was blasted by experts [upon its release in July](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/trump-doe-report-open-coal-plants). The DOE’s analysis ignores hundreds of gigawatts of new energy resources likely to come online in the coming years, the vast majority of it solar, batteries, and wind power, and it overstates power plant closures expected over the next five years.
“DOE’s assumptions unreasonably presume that the market, grid operators, and state regulators will take no action in the next five years to address load growth or reliability issues, and that no alternative other than preserving aging coal and gas power plants will ensure grid reliability,” the state attorneys general wrote in their 
The DOE hasn’t yet cited the analysis to support any stay-open orders. But the attorneys general of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, and Washington wrote that an April “subsequent statements by DOE make clear that the report will be used to justify Section 202(c) orders going forward.”
Already, before the report was issued, the DOE had used Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act to order the [J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/a-michigan-coal-plant-was-about-to-close-trump-ordered-it-to-stay-open) and the 
Doing so would also be illegal, the attorneys general state. “The Report is arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, and unsupported by substantial evidence in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and Federal Power Act because it suffers from numerous analytical, mathematical, and empirical flaws.”
The DOE wrote the July report to comply with April’s DOE did not respond to Canary Media’s requests for comment.
The report’s flaws were reiterated in a separate DOE’s analysis “fails to take account of (or simply mischaracterizes) major developments that will affect resource adequacy in the next half-decade and beyond,” including “the pace of new resource development, the retirement of existing resources, and the well-established regulatory and market mechanisms that connect these threads.”
In a webinar earlier this month, executives of these trade groups said they also fear that the DOE will use these flawed assumptions to justify ordering fossil-fueled power plants across the country to keep running. “DOE’s analysis takes a series of outlier assumptions and applies them all in one study as the only future scenario, and the result is that we’re getting predictions of blackouts,” said Caitlin Marquis, managing director at Advanced Energy United. “When it’s applied as directed in the executive order to resource-retention decisions, there will be real-world consequences to those actions.”
Indeed, forcing fossil-fueled plants to stay open could “inflict significant harm on our states,” the attorneys general wrote in their rehearing request. In Colorado and Washington state, coal plants set to close in 2025 could be forced to keep running, despite their closure plans being “thoroughly vetted by state and regional authorities and approved only following an extensive examination of cost considerations and reliability impacts.”
States that are part of regional power markets must still share in the expenses of power plants ordered to stay open, as is the case for the J.H. Campbell plant. Keeping that facility running between late May and the end of June DOE’s 90-day stay-open order this week. That price tag is 
The financial toll could rise dramatically if the DOE uses its authority under Section 202(c) to prevent any fossil-fuel plants nationwide from closing on schedule in the coming years. An analysis from consultancy Grid Strategies found [those costs could add up to](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/forcing-dirty-power-plants-to-stay-open-would-cost-americans-billions) $3 billion to nearly $6 billion per year by 2028.
This month’s filings aren’t the first challenges to the DOE’s use of Section 202(c) authority.
State regulators and environmental groups [filed rehearing requests to the DOE’s stay-open orders](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/trump-coal-plant-order-challenges) in Michigan and Pennsylvania, on the grounds that they violate the agency’s legitimate use of Section 202(c) to deal with near-term emergencies. The DOE did not respond to those requests, which prompted DOE’s decisions in court. Those petitions for review are pending.
It’s not clear if the agency will respond to these new challenges either, which could prompt lawsuits from the states or the industry. The offices of the nine attorneys general that are seeking a rehearing on the report did not immediately return Canary Media’s requests for comment.","Politics, Fossil fuels",states-demand-trump-fix-grid-reliability-report.md,articles_politics

Trump ordered it to stay open.,26 May 2025,Jeff St. John,"Environmental and consumer advocates say the DOE has “manufactured an emergency” to keep a costly, polluting coal plant running and serve Trump’s pro-coal agenda.

The Trump administration has followed through on a threat to use emergency wartime powers to force expensive and polluting coal-fired power plants to stay open — even if the utilities that own them, the states in which they operate, and the grid operators responsible for maintaining reliability all agree it’s safe to shut them down.
On Friday, the U.S. Department of Energy issued an 1,560-megawatt coal-burning power plant owned by Michigan utility Consumers Energy, must abandon its plans to shut down on May 31 and instead continue operating through at least late August.
The order from Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former gas industry executive and a vocal “an emergency exists in portions of the Midwest region of the United States due to a shortage of electric energy.” It cites this rationale to invoke the DOE’s emergency authority under the 
“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families,” Wright said in a Friday “bringing back” the U.S. coal industry, including an [order](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/trump-coal-power-order-reliability) authorizing the DOE to cite grid reliability as justification for keeping coal plants open.
## **“ A manufactured emergency”**
Environmental and consumer watchdogs decried Friday’s announcement as an unlawful abuse of power that serves the administration’s pro-coal agenda. They warned that keeping this coal plant open will worsen pollution, harm nearby communities, and increase costs for utility customers.
“Donald Trump invoking the Federal Power Act is an illegal abuse of his presidential authority. Coal is expensive, outdated, and deadly,” Greg Wannier, senior attorney with the Sierra Club Environmental Law Program, said in a Friday MISO, the grid operator ultimately responsible for keeping the lights on in Michigan, concluded years ago that J.H. Campbell could retire without causing any grid reliability problems.”
Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program at nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen, accused the DOE of “making up a manufactured emergency to accomplish a crass political outcome — Trump being able to say, ‘I saved a coal-fired power plant.’”
Wright’s order comes just eight days before J.H. Campbell’s scheduled May 31 retirement under a plan that has [been in the works since 2021](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/michigans-consumers-energy-pushes-to-replace-all-coal-plants-with-natural-gas-by-2025). The planned shutdown is part of a broader 2025 and put the utility on a path to meeting the state’s [mandate of 100% carbon-free power by 2040](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/michigan-just-passed-one-of-the-countrys-most-ambitious-clean-energy-bills). Consumers Energy has estimated that the switch from costlier coal to cheap gas, solar, and energy storage will 
Consumers Energy has DOE’s order ignores this preparation for keeping Michigan’s grid reliable, Wannier said.
The DOE’s claims that the coal plant is necessary to ensure regional grid reliability do not hold up, he said. Michigan regulators, Consumers Energy, and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), the entity that manages grid reliability across Michigan and 14 other Midwest states, have had years to plan for losing the coal plant’s energy and capacity services, and have found no reason to delay its closure, he said.
MISO has the power to order power plants to stay open if it determines their closure could threaten grid reliability. MISO used that authority most recently during the Biden administration to “reliability must run” request that was approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission — the standard practice for such emergency stay-open orders.
The DOE’s order provided no evidence that either MISO or Consumers Energy had made such a request for J.H. Campbell.
MISO spokesperson Brandon Morris told Canary Media in a Monday email that MISO did not request that DOE issue the emergency order. “MISO will coordinate with Consumers Energy to support compliance with the federal order as we prepare to maintain grid reliability throughout the summer season,” he said.
The DOE justified its emergency order by citing a MISO was the only grid region in North America to rank as​“high risk” for future grid reliability challenges. Like many other parts of the country, MISO is [struggling to add new generation resources](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/miso-grid-gas-interconnection) to the grid fast enough to keep up with demand. The vast majority of projects waiting to connect are solar, wind, and batteries, which could help replace the [aging and money-losing coal plants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/coal-grid-reliability-trump) being shut down.
Wannier emphasized that such broad findings about potential future reliability don’t justify emergency stay-open orders. “DOE’s citation to NERC is definitely overbroad,” he said. NERC’s risk assessment for MISO “does not create an ‘emergency’ sufficient to take an action as drastic as DOE has taken here.”
The DOE also cites MISO said at that time that summer months present the “highest risk and a tighter supply-demand balance.”
But Wannier pointed out that MISO’s auction in fact “ensured that each zone within MISO has sufficient resources to meet its resource adequacy objectives for the summer, as it does every year.”
The DOE’s order appeared to acknowledge this fact, noting that MISO also stated that it had “demonstrated sufficient capacity” for all its regions. 
Slocum said these gaps in the DOE’s explanation for taking this drastic step are evidence that the agency is “looking for an emergency, and looking for a chance to deploy it.”
“There’s no methodology here. There’s no fact-based assessment,” he said. “Summer is now an emergency to the Trump administration.”
## **Who will pay for keeping an unnecessary coal plant open?**
The DOE’s order also fails to make clear how Consumers Energy, MISO, and state and federal regulators should determine the cost of forcing this coal plant to keep running over the summer, and who will end up paying for it, Wannier said.
Power plants operating in MISO rely on the grid operator’s energy market prices and dispatch signals to decide whether they should start up and run or stay idle from one hour to the next. The costs of running coal plants often exceeds the payments they can realize from selling electricity into these markets.
But many utilities operating in MISO territory, [including in Michigan](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/uneconomic-coal-plants-cost-michigan-ratepayers-millions-analysts-say), are already [pushing billions of dollars of unnecessary costs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/indianas-dependence-on-coal-is-costing-ratepayers-millions-and-holding-back-clean-energy-growth) onto their customers by running coal plants at times when other power sources would be cheaper, according to studies of data conducted over the past half decade.
The DOE’s order directed MISO to take “every step to employ economic dispatch of the Campbell Plant to minimize cost to ratepayers.” But the order also instructs MISO to “effectuate the dispatch and operation of the units for the reasons specified herein.”
The problem, Wannier explained, is that it’s highly unlikely that the prices being offered to generators on MISO’s energy market will be high enough to recoup the costs of running the aging coal plant. This lack of profitability is the main reason why [so many coal plants are being shut down](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/coal-grid-reliability-trump).
That means that the safest way for Consumers Energy and MISO to attempt to meet the DOE’s order that the coal plant be up and running through the summer is to allow it to “self-schedule,” or run “no matter what and accept whatever the clearing energy prices are,” Wannier said. That, in turn, makes it very probable that the coal plant will be losing money.
“DOE is saying Consumers and MISO need to work out how much Consumers has to get paid for operating the plant, and if they can’t work it out, DOE will impose something,” he said. “But none of this makes clear who DOE thinks should end up holding the bag if they can’t agree. And it’s bad news for whoever has to pay because there’s no way Campbell gets enough reimbursement from MISO energy markets to financially justify its continued existence.”
Slocum highlighted that utilities and grid operators have a legal obligation to operate power plants and markets in ways that do not unjustly or arbitrarily force costs onto utility customers. That’s the issue on which Public Citizen intends to launch its first challenge to the order — not against the DOE, but in the proceeding that the order requires Consumers Energy to launch before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
“DOE’s order explicitly directs Consumers Energy, as the owner of the coal-fired power plant, to file a cost-recovery filing at FERC,” Slocum said. “We’re going to be challenging that filed rate as unjust and unreasonable, because the emergency is fake.”
“It’s one thing for Trump to say he wants to bring coal back. It’s another thing to abuse emergency powers that trigger forced payments by ratepayers,” he continued. “Once again, Trump is asking other people to pay for his nonsense.”","Politics, Fossil fuels",a-michigan-coal-plant-was-about-to-close-trump-ordered-it-to-stay-open.md,articles_politics

These days, I’m sure it’s frustrating and depressing to spend your time thinking about energy and climate issues. Global coal use hit an all-time high last year. So did greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. Now President Donald Trump and his Republican lackeys are maniacally rolling back America’s clean-energy progress, sledgehammering renewables while subsidizing pollution.

But just think how frustrated and depressed those of us who spend our time thinking about food and climate issues must be.

On energy, the world at least knows what it needs to do — electrify the global economy and run it on clean electricity — even if it’s not doing it quickly or consistently enough. On food, the world isn’t even sure what it needs to know, and the problems are quickly and consistently getting worse.
That’s why I wrote my new food and climate book, “3% of climate finance and maybe 0.3% of climate conversations.

But I knew nothing about its impact on the planet when I started my research six years ago, and I suspect most people are still as ignorant now as I was then.
The book covers dozens of promising food and climate solutions — including some I wrote about for Canary, like [this bad-ass super-tree](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/food-and-farms/this-super-tree-could-help-feed-the-world-and-fight-climate-change), [this eco-friendly bio-fertilizer](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/food-and-farms/chemical-fertilizer-is-a-climate-disaster-can-high-tech-biology-fix-it), [high-yield pastures](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/food-and-farms/cattle-are-a-huge-climate-threat-smarter-ranching-can-help), and [high-tech food](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/food-and-farms/afraid-of-high-tech-food-get-over-it). The bad news is that none of them have achieved the kind of scale necessary to make a serious dent in emissions. But 20 years ago, the same was true of energy and climate solutions — and the good news is that [nearly all new U.S. power plants are zero-carbon](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-96-percent-of-new-us-power-capacity-was-carbon-free-in-2024), while electric vehicles look like the future of transportation.
The additional bad news is that we’re losing a soccer field’s worth of forest to agriculture every six seconds; we’re on track to lose another dozen Californias’ worth of forest by 2050; and we don’t have another 20 years or dozen Californias to spare if we want to avoid climate catastrophes. Even if all 8 billion of us stop burning fossil fuels tomorrow, we’ll still blow past the 2050 targets in the Paris climate accord if we don’t fix how we consume and produce food. Our food problems are mostly land problems; we’re eating the earth, and we’ll need to eat much less of it if we don’t want to obliterate our remaining carbon sinks.
In other words, food needs to get where energy is now in a hurry. So what political lessons can the food world learn from two decades of energy progress?
## **The government has to help**
The first lesson of the energy transition is that it has required public investment. The U.S. government’s national labs, scientific grants, and other RD funding helped spur the development of solar panels, electric-vehicle batteries, and other climate-friendly technologies. Federal subsidies, tax credits, and other aid to manufacturers and consumers then helped deploy and scale those technologies — driving down their costs, reducing the “green premium” that makes untested eco-innovations unattractive to investors and consumers, and helping them compete with fossil-fueled incumbents. The Chinese government has been far more aggressive about subsidizing deployment, which is why China is building more renewable power and electric cars than the rest of the world combined.
The Biden administration did start investing in climate-friendly food and agriculture solutions, such as 
But the Trump administration is undoing Joe Biden’s green agriculture initiatives, and in any case they were orders of magnitude smaller than the rivers of cash cascading into green energy. That’s a big reason why food and land solutions are off to such a slow start, and why private investment is lagging as well; for example, the cultivated meat industry has attracted $3 billion in its entire history for its efforts to displace beef and pork, while the solar industry attracted $500 billion just last year to take on natural gas and coal.
Obviously, the U.S. government won’t invest in climate solutions as long as Trump and the GOP are running it. And while research into more productive and resilient crops and livestock could help the climate even if it isn’t labeled “climate research,” Trump is slashing funding for all research. But countries that haven’t lost their collective minds on climate or research should try to do for food what they’ve done for energy. There are woefully underfunded scientists around the world trying to convert crop residues into high-quality animal feed, reduce fertilizer pollution through a nerds-only process called “
A corollary to that lesson is that governments should let a thousand flowers bloom, investing in all kinds of potential alternatives to the status quo. In my last book, “2009 stimulus bill poured $90 billion into a dizzying array of clean-energy solutions: advanced hydropower; enhanced geothermal; photovoltaic and concentrated solar; energy-efficient windows and bulbs; a slew of battery technologies; biofuels brewed from crops and wood and algae; and the factories to manufacture all that green stuff in the U.S. You can mock it as unfocused spray-and-pray, but the idea was that instead of picking winners and losers, the government would pick the game of clean energy, then let the markets sort out the winners and losers. And it worked.
Oh, there were plenty of losers. The most famous was “green boondoggle” after it defaulted on a half-billion-dollar stimulus loan. The massive stimulus-funded concentrated solar project [“clean coal” projects](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-capture/us-government-squandered-hundreds-of-millions-on-clean-coal-pipedream).But the green stimulus helped jump-start America’s photovoltaic solar industry and start driving down the price of silicon panels, which is why Solyndra’s and Ivanpah’s more expensive approaches to solar faltered in the marketplace. The stimulus also created a domestic electric-vehicle battery industry, while helping wind power and LED lighting reach critical mass. And even though none of its biofuels or clean-coal projects panned out, learning which technologies don’t work is almost as important as learning which ones do.
It’s also important for governments to act on what they learn, rather than continuing to invest in the flowers that fail to bloom. The classic example of throwing good money after bad in the energy space is farm-grown fuels; there’s still bipartisan support for giving the farm lobby the [destabilize the climate](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/food-and-farms/biofuels-are-accelerating-the-food-crisis-and-the-climate-crisis-too). Biden was a vocal cheerleader for corn ethanol, and Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, while [obliterating tax credits](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/tax-credit-changes-trump-law) for truly clean energy, 
The Biden administration’s first $3 billion climate-smart agriculture initiative did follow the let-a-thousand-flowers-bloom investment model, and even though I [didn’t love](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/food-and-farms/biden-trump-climate-smart-agriculture) its focus on scientifically dubious efforts to sequester carbon in farm soils, it did seed an 
## **All is not lost**
Like I said, it can get frustrating and depressing.
To meet those 2050 Paris climate targets, the world will need dramatic reductions in farm emissions and meat consumption, which are both soaring, along with dramatic increases in farm yields, which are threatened by climate-driven droughts, floods, and heat waves. The politics are especially dismal. The Biden team focused on providing incentives for green energy as well as green agriculture rather than cracking down on pollution from dirty energy and agriculture, under the theory that carrots are more popular and politically resilient than sticks, but Republicans killed most of those positive incentives anyway, and even many Democrats now believe the climate is a losing issue no matter how it’s framed.
So yes, change will be extremely hard. But energy’s biggest political lesson for food is that change is possible. Two decades ago, wind and solar power were global rounding errors, a documentary called “Who Killed the Electric Car?” eulogized an apparently dead technology, and crop-based biofuels looked like the only viable alternative to fossil fuels. It’s amazing how quickly the unfathomable can become almost inevitable. Technologies can get better and cheaper. Politics can be unpredictable. Conventional wisdom can be spectacularly wrong.
One confounding example: all the confident pronouncements about carrots and sticks. Yes, Obama stimulus goodies helped jump-start the energy transition, while taxes and other restrictions on agricultural pollution in Europe inspired farmers to blockade highways with tractors and dump manure on government buildings. (One American pollster told me meat taxes were the least popular government policy idea he’s ever surveyed, “up there with veterans benefits for ISIS.”) But the carrots in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act did not turn out to be resilient to Trump’s political vandalism, while cap-and-trade sticks that many pundits assumed would be politically toxic have thrived in California and the European Union.
What does seem to be as true for food as energy is the cliché that there’s no one silver-bullet solution, just the silver buckshot of multiple solutions, although copper buckshot is probably a better metaphor, because the solutions need to get cheap to get to scale. We’ll need all kinds of demand-side solutions — like meatless meats made from plants and fungi and animal cells, as well as anti-food-waste technologies ranging from 
Solar panels were invented in the 1950s, but didn’t become cheap enough to compete with fossil fuels until the 2010s. We don’t have 60 years to get food solutions to scale.
Of course, the development of solar has also been held back by backlash politics; Ronald Reagan removed the panels Jimmy Carter installed on the White House roof, and Trump is trying to crush clean energy while preaching energy dominance. Like I said, progress will be really hard. But it’s also really important. And while perfect probably isn’t on the menu, better is better than worse.
This may be the most important lesson of the energy transition: Climate change is not a pass-fail test. We almost surely won’t meet the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, but 1.6 would be much better than 1.7. Everything won’t be fine if we meet the goal of cutting emissions 43% by 2030, and it won’t be game over for the climate if we only cut 42%. There’s no such thing as game over for the climate, only degrees of better and worse. The apocalyptic language of failure is weirdly both too pessimistic — “business as usual” projections for 2100 have moderated from an insanely horrific 5 degrees to a still-terrible but more manageable 3 degrees — and too optimistic. Paradise, California, already had its climate apocalypse when a wildfire destroyed it, and more apocalypses are coming. Better policies, technologies, and behaviors will mean fewer apocalypses.
That’s not an inspiring bumper-sticker slogan, but politics is about the slow boring of hard boards. The global economy is not decarbonizing quickly enough, but it’s getting a little bit less dependent on fossil fuels every day, and food can follow a similar trajectory that can help us eat less of the earth.
It isn’t happening yet. Agriculture is still expanding. Forests are still falling. But the Chinese proverb that the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, and the second-best time is today, is literally true for our land and climate problems. We’re not close to fixing them, or even making them better, but we ought to at least try to slow down the rate at which they’re getting worse — and now is the time to start.","Food and farms, Clean energy, Policy regulation",lessons-clean-energy-decarbonization.md,articles_food-and-farms

We can still draw useful lessons from it.

_The “_[ _Eating the Earth_](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/columns/eating-the-earth-decarbonizing-our-food-systems) _” column explores the connections between the food we eat and the climate we live in._
Farms are a huge climate problem, so it was great that the Biden administration made a huge commitment to “climate-smart agriculture.” But some details of its first $3 billion initiative to make agriculture climate-smarter were not so great.
The Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program, launched by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in early 2022, provided generous grants to America’s least cash-strapped agribusinesses, including Archer Daniels Midland, JBS, Tyson, Cargill, and PepsiCo, as well as America’s most influential farm groups, representing corn, soybeans, cotton, pork, and dairy. A few of its 135 projects actually looked climate-harmful, financing emissions-boosting pseudo-solutions like [biofuels](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/food-and-farms/biofuels-are-accelerating-the-food-crisis-and-the-climate-crisis-too), 
Far too many grants went to scientifically controversial efforts to sequester carbon in farm soils through trendy “regenerative” practices like planting cover crops and reducing tillage, and not enough flowed to simpler, evidence-backed strategies to reduce methane and nitrous oxide emissions. And the Biden USDA’s well-intentioned efforts to make sure a large portion of the grants went to smaller farms, specialty crops, sympathetic nonprofits, and traditionally underserved communities often seemed to take precedence over reducing emissions.
I wrote a [skeptical column](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/food-and-farms/what-exactly-is-climate-smart-agriculture) about then-President Joe Biden’s climate-smart approach back in 2022,so I had mixed feelings when the Trump administration cancelled the climate-smart commodities program this April. It was clearly a flawed program. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins had a point when she mocked it as slow and bureaucratic. While her primary complaint that it didn’t send enough money directly to farmers wasn’t my primary complaint — “sky-high administration fees.”
But no one truly believes the program’s cancellation had much to do with flaws in its design or execution. Its fatal flaw, from the Trump perspective, was obviously its climate-smart premise; Rollins slagged it as “largely built to advance the green new scam,” in violation of “Trump administration priorities.” Those priorities are not a secret: This administration doesn’t believe agriculture policy should have anything to do with the climate, which is why it scrubbed the word “climate” from USDA’s website. It doesn’t care that agriculture generates one-fourth of all greenhouse gas emissions.
Nobody who’s concerned about the planet should be happy that an imperfect agricultural program was cancelled for the sin of trying to reduce agricultural emissions. As University of Iowa economist Silvia Secchi, one of the program’s harshest critics, puts it, “Regardless of my opinion of these grants, it makes no sense to kill them before we learn anything.” The Environmental Working Group published “Even if we didn’t love where all the money was going, it was better than just giving farmers subsidies,” says the group’s Midwest director, Anne Schechinger.
When President Donald Trump commits egregious transgressions — deporting a Venezuelan hairdresser to El Salvador or investigating the mayor of Chicago for bragging about his diverse staff — pundits often try to look balanced by criticizing the suboptimal behaviors he uses as excuses: Biden neglected the border; DEI went too far. There’s a reluctance to simply say: This is egregious.
Well, I spent the last six years reporting USDA agreed to keep funding some of the climate-smart grants after farm groups protested their cancellation, but it’s not calling them climate-smart anymore, and it won’t pursue climate-smart investments in the future. It’s defiantly climate-dumb.
But I’ve also [pointed out that it’s boring](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/food-and-farms/grunwald-trump-food-climate) to harp on the badness of a climate-denial administration doing climate-denial things. And there are lessons we can learn from the politics and substance of the climate-smart partnerships — about mistakes that shouldn’t be repeated, and at least one remarkable success story that should be expanded worldwide.
## **What is climate-smart ag? A federal experiment to find out is over.**
In my book, I tell the tale of a big internal Biden administration fight over climate-smart agriculture that never made it into the public eye.
On one side was then-Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who wanted to pay farmers to adopt regenerative practices — like keeping soils covered and minimizing soil disturbance — that he believed would sequester carbon in their soils and help reverse climate change. He loved the idea of fifth-generation Republican dirt farmers who wore John Deere hats and drove Ford F-150s embracing kinder and gentler approaches to their land that would help them earn a premium for sustainably grown commodities and sell soil-carbon credits as an extra crop.
On the other side was White House climate aide David Hayes, who thought soil carbon was wildly overhyped — by the United Nations, environmentalists, foundations who seemed to cough up cash whenever they heard the word “regenerative,” celebrity-studded documentaries like “
Hayes was right about the science. It’s extraordinarily difficult to measure soil carbon accurately or ensure it remains underground. It’s also extraordinarily difficult to build more soil carbon without adding more nitrogen in the form of fertilizer or manure, which have negative climate impacts of their own. 2019 to help regenerative farmers sequester a trillion tons of soil carbon, has gotten less than one one-millionth of the way to that goal. Regenerative agriculture also tends to produce less food per acre, which means it requires more acres to produce the same amount of food, which means it accelerates the global march of farmland into carbon-rich forests and wetlands.
“There’s just too much excitement about soil carbon,” Hayes told me.

But Vilsack won on the politics. Most of the climate-smart grants promoted regenerative practices designed to move atmospheric carbon underground and help build new markets where farmers could sell soil-carbon credits — and the same was true for another $20 billion steered toward climate-smart agriculture by Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Cover crops and no-till were by far the best-funded practices, even though there’s at best mixed evidence that they can sequester much carbon. Biden even dropped a prime-time plug for cover crops into his first address to Congress.
If USDA’s soil-carbon obsession started the program on the wrong track, it strayed even further from its climate-smart mission by insisting that 40% of its grants go to underserved communities, and by promoting regenerative hemp, regenerative sorghum, and dozens of other alternatives to big row-crop commodities. Some of the resulting projects were just weird. One $20 million regenerative grant was divided among small farmers in New York, minority farmers in North Carolina, wine growers in California, and a nonprofit called Nature for Justice, as well as traditional big corn and soy producers in the Midwest and the giant agribusiness Corteva. It was hard to see a coherent strategy behind the grant, beyond spreading money across the country and checking all the Biden team’s priority boxes. In any case, the Trump team has cancelled it, along with dozens of other grants that explicitly prioritized equity and diversity.
Hayes did pressure USDA to make a serious commitment to verifying actual soil-carbon results, and to his credit, Vilsack agreed, creating a $300 million monitoring fund and steering a variety of grants toward data collection and measurement. Vilsack was excited to document the climate benefits underground, while Hayes suspected the department would learn that soil carbon was mostly a mirage; either way, it would gather valuable information.
But the Trump administration is cancelling those data-focused grants, too, part of its push to scrap grants that proposed to send less than 65% of their cash directly to farmers, or had not yet sent any cash to farmers. The measurement grants generally sent more cash to scientists, universities, and companies like Indigo.
The Trump team also axed most of the grants focused on large numbers of small farms growing unconventional crops, because they required much more administration. For example, the Pennsylvania group Pasa Sustainable Agriculture lost a $59 million grant because it planned to buy supplies like cover crops and tree seedlings in bulk for 2,000 farms as small as a quarter-acre rather than giving the cash to the farmers and making them buy supplies themselves. The association’s director, Hannah Smith-Brubaker, says it was finally ready to ramp up in the field after spending just $2 million of its grant over the first two years, mostly on administration and preparation — and now it won’t be spending anything.
“This was supposed to be an experiment,” Smith-Brubaker says. “We’d spend five years tackling these problems on different types of farms with different practices, and we’d start to get some comprehensive answers about what works. It’s such a shame that we won’t.”
Robert Bonnie, Vilsack’s deputy who oversaw the grants, says there was a political strategy behind the grant program: By offering farmers carrots rather than sticks, and helping them develop markets for climate-smart commodities regardless of their personal climate views, USDA could build lasting support for evidence-based innovations in farm country. But he says he underestimated the Trump team’s enthusiasm for policy vandalism, for trashing anything it could fit into its culture war against anything Biden-related or climate-related.
“It turns out there are no rules, and nothing matters,” Bonnie told me.
Again, it’s not the Biden team’s fault that the Trump team hates the climate. But just as many climate hawks now wish the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean-energy provisions had focused more on getting green stuff built quickly, and less on requiring union labor, American-made components, and other conditions unrelated to the climate, it’s tempting to wonder what the climate-smart grants could have achieved before Trump ransacked them if they had focused on delivering quick emissions-reducing results.
Actually, we don’t have to wonder, because a single grant amounting to just 0.25% of the $3 billion climate-smart commodities program did exactly that.
## **Soil carbon wasn’t “practical and profitable.” But this was.**
Four years ago, when a 23-year-old finance whiz named Tyler Hull was working for a farmland asset manager in Nashville, Tennessee, he spun off a subsidiary called 
But once he dug into the science and mechanics of soil carbon capture, Hull concluded it was mostly bogus. He calculated that farmers could at best sequester one-fifth of a ton of carbon underground per acre, so they would earn less selling credits than they would spend on seeds for cover crops — and since tilling the soil in the future would release the sequestered carbon, the carbon-credit agreements would prohibit any tillage on the land for decades.
“It just didn’t work,” Hull recalls. “We had to pivot.”
Hull soon stumbled across an emissions-reduction opportunity that wasn’t bogus at all: reducing methane from rice fields through better water management. Methane-producing microbes that thrive in flooded rice fields are responsible for 10% of the world’s agricultural emissions, but reducing the duration of flooding through practices like “alternative wetting and drying” and “furrow irrigation” can cut those emissions in half — the equivalent of up to two tons per acre, with no drag on yield and no restrictions on future land management.
AgriCapture received a $7.5 million climate-smart grant in 2022, and it was the only project to start sending money to farmers that first year. It used remote sensing to document 30,000 tons of methane reductions on 25,000 acres, then sold the credits to an international bank. It also saved 9 billion gallons of fresh water without any loss of yield. This year, it’s enrolling 150,000 acres, about 5% of U.S. rice production. The Trump administration is allowing the project to continue because it’s already used most of its grant, and Hull says it will be able to keep expanding without additional federal subsidies.
If rice farmers worldwide all adopted these practices, they could eliminate enough emissions to offset half the aviation industry.
“This can become the new normal,” Hull says. “It’s practical and profitable, and even if you don’t care about global warming, it’s saving water and creating a new export market for American farmers: carbon credits you can trust.”
Regenerative agriculture is sexy and popular, with support from Al Gore, Joe Rogan, Rosario Dawson, the Indian mystic Sadhguru, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but its ability to move a lot of carbon from sky to soil remains speculative at best. By contrast, AgriCapture’s effort to reduce methane by reducing flooding on rice fields is simple, effective, and potentially lucrative.
There are also proven strategies to reduce methane from cow burps with feed additives, reduce nitrous oxide emissions by using fertilizer more efficiently, and store carbon above ground by planting trees and shrubs in pastures and fields — with climate benefits that are relatively easy to measure and monetize. The Biden team could have made an international splash by bringing those strategies to scale, if it hadn’t been so excited about its soil-carbon experiment.
Now that experiment is over, and that’s Trump’s fault.
But in the future, if policymakers who do care about climate progress want to make climate action more popular with the public, they might want to focus on actions they know will help the climate. And if those actions can create measurable environmental benefits that farmers can get paid for, they might even be popular in farm country.","Food and farms, Emissions reduction, Policy regulation, Politics",biden-trump-climate-smart-agriculture.md,articles_food-and-farms

It’s working.,16 April 2025,Michael Grunwald,"New York City is cutting emissions and saving money by making vegetarian meals the default in public hospitals. It’s successful because most people go with the flow. 
Plant-based meals served at New York City public hospitals. (NYC Health + Hospitals/Binh Nguyen/Canary Media)
_The “_[ _Eating the Earth_](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/columns/eating-the-earth-decarbonizing-our-food-systems) _” column explores the connections between the food we eat and the climate we live in._
NEW YORK — Our food system generates one-third of our greenhouse gas emissions, and the human race has made almost no progress reducing them. Except in New York City’s public hospitals.
Before the city deployed an innovative new strategy two years ago to shrink its “carbon foodprint,” 99% of its patient meals included meat. Now more than half are vegetarian, generating 36% fewer emissions. While vegan activists have mostly failed to get us to ditch meat through education campaigns and yelling, and biotech entrepreneurs have mostly failed to convert us to plant-based substitutes designed to mimic meat, bureaucrats working for embattled Mayor Eric Adams have engineered a radical dietary shift.
Sitting in her bed in the surgical ward at Brooklyn’s Kings County Hospital, pointing at a clean plate that minutes earlier was covered with mushroom stroganoff, 60-year-old Pamela Sumlin-Gambil revealed the secret of the city’s success.
“I normally take what they offer me, you know?” she said with a shrug.
Stroganoff with shitake and cremini mushrooms — and no beef. (NYC Health + Hospitals) 
That’s the strategy. Food service associates in the city’s 11 public hospitals are trained to tell patients the chef recommends the sweet potato burrito, the red curry vegetable stew, or another plant-based meal. If the patient doesn’t bite, the associate offers a three-bean chili, a black-eyed pea casserole, or another meatless dish. If the patient says no twice, then the associate suggests a meat option. But 51% of patients don’t say no twice.
In behavioral science, this kind of nudge is known as making the preferred option the “default,” and it’s a weirdly powerful hack. When employees are automatically defaulted into a 401(k) plan, they tend to stay in it and save more for retirement; when consumers buy new TVs with a low-power default setting, they tend to leave them that way and use less power. We’re an inertial species, predisposed to accept the status quo, so “choice architecture” really matters. As Sumlin-Gambil said, we normally take what’s offered to us — and when what’s offered is better for the climate, we inadvertently reduce our impact on the planet.
The one caveat with food is that we stop taking what’s offered to us when we don’t enjoy it. That’s why New York has paired its default strategy with a conscious effort to serve delicious, nutritious, and culturally resonant plant-based meals with clean ingredient lists. And it’s working; the food service giant Sodexo, which has now served the city’s patients more than 2 million plant-based meals, reports a 98% satisfaction rate. The average vegetarian meal costs 59 cents less than meat, so the program has also saved the city more than $1 million.

In fact, the program has worked so well that Sodexo plans to expand plant-based defaults to all 400 U.S. hospitals it serves. At a time when humans already use one-third of the earth’s habitable land to raise livestock, and we’re expected to eat 50% more meat by 2050, the New York hospital experience offers hope that vegetarian defaults at universities, corporate cafeterias, and other institutional settings could help us eat less. Officials from Canada, Denmark, Germany, the U.K., and several other countries have already visited to learn how they could reduce their food emissions through defaults of their own.
“What’s so exciting is the way this retains freedom of choice. Nobody’s forced to go vegan,” said Katie Cantrell, cofounder and CEO of Greener by Default, a nonprofit that has advised New York City and Sodexo on their behavioral approach. “The idea is to make the sustainable choice the path of least resistance, without getting into the big political and cultural fights.”
Feeding the world without frying it will be one of the 21st century’s most daunting challenges. We’ll have to eat less meat, waste less food, stop clearing wilderness for new farmland, and make more food on existing farmland. I’ve written Canary columns about several promising solutions — [fake meat](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/food-and-farms/afraid-of-high-tech-food-get-over-it), [more efficient ranches](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/food-and-farms/cattle-are-a-huge-climate-threat-smarter-ranching-can-help),[a super-tree called pongamia](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/food-and-farms/this-super-tree-could-help-feed-the-world-and-fight-climate-change)— and a bunch more appear in my upcoming 2050.
Offering black bean enchiladas to hospital patients actually does seem to move the needle.
## **Delicious plant-based meals — without divisive labels**
These days, Mayor Adams is best known as the trash-talking rogue who quit the Democratic Party after the Trump administration made his corruption charges disappear. But his main claim to fame used to be his plant-based diet, which he credited with helping him lose 35 pounds and cure his diabetes in a book titled “
New York City Mayor Eric Adams samples a plant-based dish at the NYC Health + Hospitals Culinary Center. (NYC Health + Hospitals)
The hospital initiative is the centerpiece of New York’s efforts to reduce meat-eating, and Kate MacKenzie, executive director of the Mayor’s Office of Food Policy, says the default strategy is the key to driving change without provoking backlash. Most people like meat. They don’t want to be told to give it up to save the earth or even their health. But they’re not necessarily committed to eating it all the time, either. They’ll try what’s offered, if it sounds good, especially when they’re confined to a hospital bed.
“It’s not plant-based or bust. It’s not giving the food a label, so people say it’s not for them because they’re not that,” MacKenzie said. “We nudge you towards choices that are better for you and the planet, but if you really want meat, you can still get it.”
When Sodexo Chef Phil DeMaiolo created the recipes for the city’s plant-based hospital meals, his top priorities were to make them tasty and reminiscent of home, because patients who don’t eat don’t get well. The dishes are prepared in a central “culinary center” in Brooklyn with culture and demographics in mind — a stew called sancocho in Latin neighborhoods, featuring root vegetables instead of chicken or pork; red curry tofu for Indian communities; a penne pesto like the ones he ate as an Italian-American kid in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Asian patients didn’t love a pad thai without fish sauce, so DeMaiolo yanked it off the menu.
Chef Phil DeMaiolo at work. (NYC Health + Hospitals)
He doesn’t serve Impossible or Beyond burgers — not because he thinks there’s anything wrong with fake meat, just because he wants to serve more natural and recognizable vegetarian dishes.
“It’s gotta be authentic, and it’s gotta have flavor — not ‘hospital food,’ just good food,” DeMaiolo said. “Then you gotta advertise it right, and do some education.”
There’s behavioral science behind the advertising, too; studies show that calling dishes “vegan” or “vegetarian” is a turnoff to omnivores, while adjectives like “zesty” or “hearty” are much more enticing than “healthy” or “sustainable.” Even though plant-based meals are almost always better for the climate than chicken or pork, and dramatically better than beef or lamb, describing their climate benefits is apparently counterproductive. Most people prefer to associate food with comfort, joy, and their grandmother’s kitchen, not the boiling of the planet. In general, it helps to focus on the appeal of the meals, rather than their lack of meat; people want to feel like they’re getting something, not being denied something.
Chef Phil DeMaiolo with his hospital meal plans. (Michael Grunwald)
DeMaiolo says the education component is even more important to the program’s success. He began by taking field trips to all 11 hospitals, providing samples to CEOs, doctors, nurses, and janitors, getting their input as well as their buy-in. Then the real education is done by trained food service associates who not only recommend plant-based options to the patients but let them know about the nutritional benefits of each dish and eventually send them home with green and healthy recipes they can cook themselves.
At Kings County Hospital, a nearly 200-year-old institution in the East Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, a Moroccan-born food service associate named Hassan Ouhassi took his iPad to Sumlin-Gambil’s bed to make sure she had liked her mushroom stroganoff. She had; she said it tasted just like beef. He agreed; he tries every dish himself.
“I tell them it’s healthy food, I tell them they’ll like it, and they do!” Ouhassi said. “They clean their plates. Sometimes they ask for meat, which is fine. Not usually, though.”

This is the power of defaults: We’re much more likely to register to vote, sign up to be an organ donor, or renew our Netflix subscription when we have to opt out rather than opt in. Changing behaviors is hard, and we’ll have to change quite a few to maintain a habitable planet, so New York’s nudges could be a powerful model.
## **“ This is something uncontroversial that actually works”**
Mayor Adams embarked on his plant-based journey for health reasons, after he went nearly blind in one eye and his doctors told him he’d need diabetes drugs the rest of his life, so hospitals were the perfect venue to try to deploy his plant-based vision. But his food policy team is just as focused on climate. It’s set a goal of reducing the city’s food-related emissions by one-third by 2030, and shifting from meat to plants is the best way to do that. The team is expanding plant-based meals in schools and other city-run institutions while securing commitments from private institutions like Columbia University, the Bronx Zoo, and The Rockefeller Foundation to reduce their own food-related emissions by one-fourth.
MacKenzie, the director of the food policy office, says her strategy is simple: Buy less beef, offer more plants, focus on taste, and don’t guilt anyone. The city government’s emissions from food purchases are down 29%. That’s quite an achievement, because global food emissions are rising fast, mainly because global meat consumption rises just about every year.
To meet the 2050 emissions targets in the Paris climate accord, consumers in rich countries will have to reduce their consumption of meat, especially ruminant meats like beef and lamb, by about half. The problem is, our ancestors began eating meat 2 million years ago, and it literally helped make us who we are; we evolved bigger brains to help us find meat, and smaller stomachs because we didn’t need to digest as many plants. Animal flesh will be an extremely hard habit to break, which is why the default strategy that relies on our mindless willingness to outsource our dietary choices holds such promise.
“People are overwhelmed, there’s a cacophony of information thrown at them, they’ve got too many decisions to make — sometimes they just want to be told what to do,” said Eve Turow-Paul, executive director of the nonprofit Food for Climate League, which helped design the messaging for the default program. “If you can make the good choice the easy choice, without getting into the political bickering of ‘you’re taking away my burger,’ you can help people and the planet.”

The animal rights movement has tried to turn Americans against meat by exposing the cruelty of factory farms, throwing blood at models wearing fur, and holding a lot of noisy demonstrations. Biotech startups like “meatfluencers” get rich on the internet and “carnivore diets” trend on Instagram.
There are plenty of exciting potential food and climate solutions, but none of them are reducing many emissions yet. My family no longer wastes food at home, because 0.1% of American households have one. Pongamia trees produce more food than soybean plants on much worse land, but so far they’ve only been planted on about 0.01% of American farmland.
But plant-based defaults seem easy to implement, easy to scale, and remarkably effective. And unlike Meatless Mondays or plastic-straw bans, they don’t seem to induce defensiveness or hostility.
“We’re living in such depressing and polarizing times,” said Cantrell, the Greener by Default cofounder. “Well, this is something uncontroversial that actually works!”

Californians face steep up-front costs if they want to install solar panels to produce clean power and batteries to back up their homes in outages. A new state program will cover those costs for low-income homeowners, but they still have to pay up to tens of thousands of dollars initially and then wait months for the rebate to come through.
Now a startup called 
It’s the latest riff on the evolving market for [virtual power plants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants), which aggregate thousands of small energy systems into a meaningful tool to meet the energy needs of utilities or competitive electricity markets. The grid needs more energy just about everywhere in the U.S., but large-scale infrastructure construction runs into persistent delays and challenges. Adding generation and storage capacity in homes is relatively quick, and with the right incentives, can add up to a substantial tool to meet the grid’s needs.
If Haven successfully implements those incentives, it thinks it will be able to install 10 megawatts of dispatchable battery capacity across thousands of homes in the next two years. The (non-paying) customers will benefit from bill savings and backup power; to qualify for the state-funded rebate, they just need to make their batteries discharge regularly when the grid is stressed, namely in the evening hours when solar production dips and demand surges.
## **Haven’s home-battery strategy**
Haven launched in 2023 to streamline the home battery purchase experience and has overseen installations at hundreds of homes in California. But after a couple of years, cofounder and CEO Vinnie Campo determined the company needed a new strategic approach.
“We thought if you were able to remove all the friction from the process, that you could dramatically increase the adoption,” he explained. “That’s only fractionally true. The reason most people don’t get a battery is that they’re incredibly expensive.”
At the same time, utilities have begun grappling with a [sudden uptick in electricity demand](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/suddenly-us-electricity-demand-is-spiking-can-the-grid-keep-up) to [supply AI computing](https://www.canarymedia.com/boon-or-bane-what-will-data-centers-do-to-the-grid), industry, and electrification. Utilities increasingly recognize the value of fleets of aggregated batteries to help meet peak demand, Campo said, but they’re much more comfortable contracting for large assets than thousands of small ones.
Putting these threads together, Campo decided Haven should own the batteries it installs at customer homes, so it can control them to serve utilities’ grid needs, and pull together different revenue streams to lower the cost for consumers.
“We’re seeing from the utilities and the retail companies, they just want that fixed, firm capacity every day,” Campo said. “That’s part of the gap that we’re trying to play into.”
Now Haven can tap into a new tranche of state funds to make this a reality.
## **California earmarks $ 280 million for low-income solar-storage**
Batteries don’t generate power, but for arcane bureaucratic reasons California has long funded its desired battery expansion with the Self-Generation Incentive Program. This legacy program has shifted with the times, and its newest evolution opened up $280 million to pay for batteries (and optional paired solar panels) for low-income households.
Technically, those homeowners can apply for the funds themselves. But this is a rebate program, so they would have to front the cost — which can easily tally up to $30,000 or $40,000 — then wait to get paid back by SGIP, which can take three or four months, Campo said. That’s an obvious nonstarter for many households.
Haven, though, has raised a debt facility and studied up on the necessary details. It can fund the cost of installation and wait for the rebate without sweating. Then it’s on the hook to make sure the installed battery system meets the program requirements for lowering demand in the evenings over 10 years. (Haven routes the installations to local installers and partnered with an undisclosed software company to handle the distributed energy management system)
The customer, meanwhile, doesn’t have to pay Haven any money, but benefits from the backup power and from lowering their electricity demand during peak pricing hours. Customers who use the SGIP funds to pair solar with their batteries will further lower their energy bills by producing their own clean power. And after a decade, Haven will transfer ownership to the homeowners.
Haven has already signed up a few hundred households for this program; the new rebates for solar-battery systems will open up on May 20, when the state rolls out updates to its online system for processing them.
“The biggest objection we get is, people don’t think it’s real,” Campo said. “They’ve always been sold ‘free solar,’ right? And this is the first time it actually is free solar — it’s not ‘no money down,’ it’s no money ever.”
## **Complex regulations could hinder battery adoption**
Customers could be forgiven for not believing this program is real, because up until now, it hasn’t been.
State legislators originally allocated $900 million for a new branch of the long-running SGIP bureaucracy back in the Budget Act of 2022. At that time, the state was revising its policies for rooftop solar compensation to encourage more battery adoption; a flagship, broadly accessible home battery rebate could bolster that market in its time of transition. Originally, 70% of that funding was for low-income households, and the rest was open to the general populace. Rather than raising the money by charging people’s utility bills, as SGIP had previously, the Legislature pulled the new funds from the state’s cap-and-trade revenue.
But instead of quickly establishing the rules and moving the money out the door, the California Public Utilities Commission oversaw a yearslong process of laborious updates to the SGIP handbook and the backend database.
“It’s taken forever to go live,” said Joshua Buswell-Charkow, deputy director at the California Solar and Storage Association, a trade group.
While that cumbersome process was underway, the Legislature pared down most of the allocation, leaving just $280 million for low-income households. Updating the necessary web infrastructure has proven time-consuming. The commission also allowed the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the state’s largest municipal utility, to delay launching the solar-battery rebate program for Angelenos until late December, because the utility wasn’t ready to administer it on time.
The funds still need to be claimed by June 30, 2026. As the money finally starts to flow, Buswell-Charkow is most concerned about the practicality of meeting the new requirement that state-funded batteries enroll in demand response.
SGIP-funded batteries already had cycling requirements, meaning they couldn’t just sit in backup mode and not provide more value to the grid, he noted.
Going forward, the batteries have to be enrolled in a “qualified demand response program.” But, so far, the commission has only qualified two types of programs: critical peak pricing rates, which are only available to Californians who buy power from the three big investor-owned utilities, and the capacity bidding program, which currently only serves commercial customers, according to the California Solar and Storage Association’s survey of the market.
Other demand response programs include home batteries, like the [Demand-Side Grid Support](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/californias-patchwork-push-to-scale-up-virtual-power-plants) and [Emergency Load Reduction](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/californians-saved-the-grid-again-they-should-be-paid-more-for-it) programs, but the commission hasn’t approved them for the SGIP requirement.
The commission did grant an exemption for customers of municipal utilities who don’t have access to any qualified demand response programs, Buswell-Charkow said. But the regulators denied an exemption to the SGIP funds, too.
The demand response requirement “makes the program needlessly more complicated than it needs to be,” Buswell-Charkow said.
Given those layers of complexity, it’s hard to imagine homeowners wading into the morass themselves. Even local solar installers struggle with the administrative burden of meeting SGIP’s bureaucratic requirements, Buswell-Charkow noted. This could give companies like Haven an opening: If they get good at filing the necessary paperwork and executing on the dense program requirements, they can make money and give households free clean energy at the same time.

California’s premier “virtual power plant” program is already reducing the state’s reliance on polluting, costly fossil-fueled power plants. And that’s just the start of what the scattered network of solar and batteries could do to [stymie rising utility costs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/californias-utility-bill-crisis-is-clear-to-all-the-solution-not-so-much) — if the state Legislature can stave off funding cuts to the program, that is.
So finds a new DSGS) program to help California’s stressed-out grid keep up with growing electricity demand. The program pays households and businesses that already own solar panels and batteries to send their stored-up clean power back to the grid during times of peak demand, like hot summer evenings.
Continuing the program’s payments to those customers to make their stored energy available could save all California utility customers anywhere from $28 million to $206 million over the next four years, the report found.
The findings come as state lawmakers attempt to rescue the DSGS program from a new round of funding cuts. Last year, California lawmakers [slashed DSGS spending](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/california-budget-cuts-could-decimate-key-virtual-power-plant-programs) to deal with an unexpected budget shortfall. The situation is [defunding the program further](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/california-budget-demand-side-grid-support), leaving it little money to pay participants beyond this year.
But the program could regain its financial footing if newly introduced legislation becomes law.
This week, California Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, a Democrat, DSGS from the state’s 5% of DSGS from 2026 to 2034. Lawmakers don’t have much time to move the proposal forward, with the state’s legislative session ending Sept. 12.
Saving the program would be a win for reducing the state’s sky-high utility costs, according to Ryan Hledik, a principal at Brattle and coauthor of the report. “It’s cheaper to pay customers to provide grid resources from technology they’ve already adopted than it is to go invest capital in new stuff,” he said, including the fossil-fueled generators now used to meet peak grid needs.
California has already committed billions of dollars on emergency backup generators and on keeping aging fossil-gas-fired power plants open past their planned closure dates, he noted. The high end of the savings DSGS could provide is based on the assumption that it “would be a substitute for spending money on more expensive emergency resources,” he said. 
At the same time, DSGS could also bring down the “[community choice aggregators](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/guides-and-how-tos/power-by-people-glossary-bundle#community-choice-aggregator), and other power providers to secure enough grid resources to meet peak demand in future years. Those costs have been rising in California, though [not as drastically](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-markets/pjm-rising-costs-interconnection-reform) as they have in other parts of the country.
Since its launch in 2023, the battery program Brattle analyzed, which is one of the DSGS, has grown to a collective 700 megawatts of capacity. The report forecasts the program could nearly double its current capacity to reach 1.3 gigawatts by 2028, covering roughly half the total residential distributed-battery capacity expected to be online in the state by then.
That won’t happen without state funding for the program, however — and though some state lawmakers are attempting to save DSGS’s funding, it remains unclear if the money will be there for future years.
## **Relief on the way?**
If Irwin’s proposed provision becomes law, it would supply roughly $70 million to $90 million per year to DSGS over the next five years, said Brad Heavner, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association. DSGS needs at least $75 million this year to operate in 2026, according to a 35 companies, trade groups, and advocacy organizations active in solar, batteries, on-site generators, and demand response, including Heavner’s group.
The amount of funding dedicated under the proposed legislation “won’t be enough for all the program activity we expect — but it will be enough to have a core program,” he said.
DSGS’s cost-effectiveness, demonstrated by the Brattle analysis, should give lawmakers confidence that the money isn’t being wasted, Heavner said. “It’s great that the Brattle study finds there’s a two-for-one benefit — every dollar spent here saves two dollars” for utility customers across the state, he said.
Brattle’s research was funded by Sunrun and Tesla, two companies with [longtime programs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/what-could-teslas-virtual-power-plant-do-for-californias-grid-and-what-will-customers-get-out-of-it) that sign up customers to make their [excess battery capacity available](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/pg-e-is-testing-different-flavors-of-virtual-power-plant) for grid services. Both firms benefit from initiatives that boost the value of the rooftop solar and battery systems they sell to households in California and beyond.
But the study also matches broader research on how virtual power plants can [reduce blackout risks](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/heres-a-blueprint-for-building-virtual-power-plants-in-every-state) and electricity price spikes on U.S. grids. VPPs are collections of homes and businesses with smart thermostats, grid-responsive EV chargers, water heaters, and other appliances that can reduce how much power they’re using, as well as rooftop solar-charged batteries or generators that can push power back to the grid as needed.
Under the Biden administration, the U.S. Department of Energy found that the hundreds of billions of dollars that consumers spend on EVs, rooftop solar systems, batteries, smart thermostats, and other appliances could provide 80 to 160 gigawatts of VPP capacity by 2030, enough to meet 10% to 20% of U.S. peak grid needs and save about $10 billion in annual utility costs. (The Trump administration has 
VPPs also pass the eye test: They’ve helped avoid blackouts in [New England](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/northeast-heat-wave-solar-battery-benefits), and [passed laws or created regulations](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/rooftop-solar-industry-trump-budget-law) requiring utilities to expand VPPs.
DSGS, for its part, has “scaled in a way that folks can no longer poke holes in its reliability,” said Lauren Nevitt, Sunrun’s senior director of public policy. Sunrun has dispatched hundreds of megawatts from its customers’ batteries in California so far this summer, all during hours of the evening when wholesale electricity prices spike above $200 per megawatt-hour.
In a two-hour 535 megawatts of battery power to the grid in “the largest test of its kind ever done in California — and maybe the world.”
Lining up a steady source of funding for years to come would give these participating companies confidence that their investments in DSGS won’t be left stranded by future budget cuts, Heavner said — and encourage even more investment going forward.
## **VPPs on the rise**
Pressure to curb energy costs is [particularly acute in California](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/californias-utility-bill-crisis-is-clear-to-all-the-solution-not-so-much), where residential customers of the state’s three major utilities now pay 47% from 2019 to 2023.
It is also among the best-positioned states to take advantage of VPPs to rein in those costs. California leads the country in rooftop solar, backup battery, and EV adoption, and a 15% of the state’s peak grid demand by 2035, delivering $550 million in annual utility customer savings.
DSGS is only [one of a number of VPP options](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/californias-patchwork-push-to-scale-up-virtual-power-plants) available in California. But advocates say it’s by far the most successful in a state that’s seen [mixed progress on VPPs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/california-could-cut-utility-bills-with-distributed-energy-why-isnt-it) to date. In the past five years, stop-and-start policies from the California Public Utilities Commission have [reduced overall capacity](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/californians-saved-the-grid-again-they-should-be-paid-more-for-it) from demand-response programs that pay utility customers to turn down their electricity use to relieve grid stress.
DSGS, which is run by the California Energy Commission, has grown rapidly due to a combination of factors, said Edson Perez, who leads California legislative and political engagement for clean-energy trade group Advanced Energy United. It’s available to residents across the state, rather than being limited to individual utility territories and programs. It also has relatively simple enrollment and participation rules 
It can be tricky to quantify the costs and benefits of these kinds of programs compared to traditional utility investments in power plants or large-scale solar and battery systems. But Brattle’s new report is the “first analysis of what its value is out in the field,” he said, and the results show “it’s very cost-effective.”
Solar-charged batteries are also much less polluting than the state’s other emergency grid-relief resources, he said. DSGS is one of a set of emergency programs launched after California experienced 2020 and more [heat-wave-driven grid emergencies](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/californians-saved-the-grid-again-they-should-be-paid-more-for-it) in 2022.
But most of the billions of dollars in emergency funding have gone to [fossil-fueled generators](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/californias-plan-to-avoid-blackouts-relies-on-fossil-fuels-as-last-resort). California had 2024, and has “peaker” plants in Southern California open until 2026, well past their scheduled 2020 closure date.
“We’re in a statewide affordability crisis,” Perez said. “Leveraging existing resources out there drives down costs for everyone.”","Virtual power plants, Batteries, Policy regulation, Solar, West, California",california-demand-side-grid-support-benefits.md,articles_virtual-power-plants

California’s biggest [virtual power plant](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/four-ways-virtual-power-plants-can-help-the-us-grid-keep-up-with-demand) is facing over $100 million in funding cuts due to the state’s ongoing budget crisis, threatening the long-term viability of a program that can act as a crucial release valve for the state’s overburdened power grid.

It can provide hundreds of megawatts of grid relief to help the state avoid rolling blackouts on the hottest days of the year, when air conditioning use pushes the power system to its limit.
The companies paying customers to commit to making their devices available for this grid service 17 million in incentives paid to date, and roughly $82 million remaining for future spending, 
But the program’s future is now uncertain as legislators search for ways to alleviate California’s DSGS program already saw much of its state funding [cut back last year](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/california-budget-cuts-could-decimate-key-virtual-power-plant-programs) due to similar budget issues — and now it’s back on the chopping block.
Late last week, state legislative committees “2024, including $75 million from the 46.6 million from the [climate bond passed late last year](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/california-voters-pass-10b-bond-to-help-protect-people-from-climate-change). Newsom’s plan would also pull $18 million from DSGS’s existing budget.
The state Legislature must pass a budget bill DSGS with about $64 million for the fiscal year that starts in July, according to Olivine. That won’t kill the program immediately: “Staff anticipate having sufficient funding for the 2025 program season,” which runs from May through October, Olivine states on its 
But Edson Perez, who leads trade group Advanced Energy United’s legislative and political engagement in California, says funding cuts will severely cloud the outlook for a virtual power plant program that has been a rare success in the state.
For the past decade, California has [largely failed to follow through](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/california-could-cut-utility-bills-with-distributed-energy-why-isnt-it) on its stated policy objectives of developing virtual power plant programs, he said. Most of the state’s utility-run virtual power plant programs have [either stagnated or been canceled](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/california-could-cut-utility-bills-with-distributed-energy-why-isnt-it).
DSGS, by contrast, is “a very successful program, leading the nation for distributed energy,” Perez said. According to the latest tallies by Advanced Energy United, the program boasts 800 megawatts of capacity ready to participate in reducing peak grid demands this summer, he said, up from more than 500 megawatts enrolled as of last fall. That’s an enormous amount of energy flexibility, comparable to the capacity available from a fossil-gas-fired “peaker” plant.
Keeping the program running for the long haul requires having enough money to give participants confidence that it will still exist from one year to the next, Perez said. To be clear, it’s very hard to predict exactly how much money is needed to provide that confidence, because DSGS participants are paid for responding to grid emergencies. If weather conditions are mild and power supplies hold up, they could be called on very rarely, if at all, and money could be left over for next year.
But if lots of emergencies happen, the funds could be depleted quickly. In that event, participating companies will have to come back in January 2026 to plead for more money to keep it going, with no guarantee the funding will be granted. That’s not a sustainable way to do business, Perez said — and it’s not a sustainable way to build a resource that the state’s grid can truly rely on.
## **Following through on a successful experiment**
California’s DSGS program began three years ago not as a virtual power plant but as an experimental response to a [grid reliability crisis](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/californians-saved-the-grid-again-they-should-be-paid-more-for-it). The program has grown rapidly since then — largely because the California Energy Commission structured DSGS in a way that avoids the complications of past programs, Perez said. But the growth was also driven by companies that have invested since 2022 to deploy the underlying technologies needed to reliably control thousands of customer-owned devices for up to two hours per day.
Those companies have committed to paying customers both up-front incentives and “performance payments” when they follow through on their promises to allow their devices to reduce power use or push power back to the grid. In some cases, companies have offered discounts on smart thermostats and other devices. All of these commitments are based on the expectation that state funding won’t be pulled away, Perez said.
“The companies in this space need certainty,” he said.
That’s the argument being made by Sunrun, Generac, Renew Home, and other companies working in the DSGS program, along with community energy providers and trade groups. In a “to continue investing in market development and customer onboarding,” and to give customers “certainty in program length to estimate their returns upon participation.”
Sunrun, the country’s leading residential solar and battery installer, has had its ups and downs with California’s ever-changing virtual power plant policies, said Chris Rauscher, the company’s head of grid services and electrification. It has had to [restructure projects](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/californias-patchwork-push-to-scale-up-virtual-power-plants) as regulators and utilities altered program rules. One of Sunrun’s large-scale pilot projects with utility Pacific Gas Electric was 
Still, Sunrun has continued to enlist customers in what it calls the 56,000 customers capable of providing 250 megawatts of electricity from their batteries to relieve statewide grid stress for up to two hours at a time, Rauscher said. While Sunrun is participating in other virtual power plant opportunities, it has centered its efforts on preparing to serve the DSGS program.
Importantly, DSGS is also one of the few programs in California that doesn’t bar solar-charged batteries from injecting their power back into the grid — most others allow them only to reduce a household’s grid draw to zero. Allowing the equipment to send power back can roughly double their impact on relieving grid stress.
“You can very easily picture that by 2030, we’re operating a nuclear power plant-sized [virtual power plant] in California,” Rauscher said. “It sure would be a shame if the rug got pulled out from under this clean, reliable, and resilient resource that’s providing payments to Californians.”
DSGS is also good value for the money, argued Kate Unger, senior policy advisor at the California Solar and Storage Association, a trade group pushing for funding to be restored.
“DSGS is providing energy when otherwise it’s going to be at emergency pricing, when it’s about the most expensive energy you can possibly buy,” she said. The most popular option for participants in the DSGS program is its battery storage virtual power plant, in which customers agree to allow companies to dispatch their batteries on days when the day-ahead price of power on the state’s wholesale energy market exceeds $200 per megawatt-hour. That’s a proxy for days when the state’s grid operator has forecasted that demand for power, most often due to air conditioning use during heat waves, will exceed available energy supplies.
But importantly, DSGS providers are _not_ paid the wholesale energy market price, Unger said. Instead, the program pays companies and customers lower amounts based on energy or capacity actually delivered. That “pay-for-performance” structure helps ensure that the state is getting value for the money it’s spending, she said.
In that sense, DSGS is “one of the most cost-effective forms of insurance for grid emergencies that you can have,” said Ben Brown, CEO of [Nest Renew](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/google-nest-thermostats-will-soon-help-you-use-more-and-even-buy-clean-energy) and [residential demand-response startup](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/ohmconnect-raises-55m-to-enlist-more-homes-to-prevent-blackouts) OhmConnect, has set its sights on establishing [gigawatts of virtual power plant capacity](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/google-nest-spinout-picks-texas-for-1gw-virtual-power-plant) with existing and new customers across the country. It has an undisclosed number of customers participating in DSGS.
It’s more difficult to measure the reduction in energy use from thermostats that dial down air conditioning than to measure the amount of power that batteries inject back onto the grid. But Renew Home has 15 years of experience in utility and energy market programs that Nest has run across the country, and has confidence that it can deliver on the grid relief it has pledged to the DSGS program, Brown said.
Still, it takes time for demand-side programs like these to become a reliable part of the grid resource mix, he said. They must both entice customers to participate and then use financial incentives to encourage them to stick around.
“You can’t just have a program stand up and be able to operate that at scale overnight,” Brown said. “Having certainty over the next five years is pretty important when you’re talking about subsidizing technology.”
## **Measuring virtual power plants against the alternatives**
Financial certainty is particularly key to getting a new form of carbon-free grid resource up and running, DSGS backers say. But to date, fossil-fueled alternatives have gotten most of the money from the multi-billion-dollar emergency backup programs created after the state’s [close brush with similar blackouts in 2022](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/californians-saved-the-grid-again-they-should-be-paid-more-for-it).
As of last spring, California had 2026, well past their scheduled 2020 closure date — a decision that runs counter to the state’s environmental and climate policies.
DSGS, by contrast, relies on resources that don’t emit carbon or toxic air pollution. What’s more, the smart thermostats, solar-charged batteries, smart EV chargers, and other devices involved are being installed and paid for by California residents for their own purposes.
Customer-owned resources could significantly lower energy bills for Californians. A 15% of the state’s peak grid demand by 2035 and save California consumers about $550 million per year by then.
Most of that money would go to the owners of the devices being tapped. But utility customers at large would save about $50 million, compared to what they’d otherwise have to pay for utility-scale resources to fill in where virtual power plant capacity had failed to emerge, the report found. That’s an important consideration in a state where [utility electricity rates have risen](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/californias-utility-bill-crisis-is-clear-to-all-the-solution-not-so-much) to roughly double the U.S. average and are set to keep climbing in coming years.
Not everyone is confident that virtual power plants are a truly reliable alternative to more traditional options. California utility regulators and grid operators have 
Nor is California’s grid as vulnerable to summer heat waves as it was in 2020 and 2022 when these emergency grid relief programs were created. In the intervening years, the state has [added gigawatts of energy storage](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/batteries/batteries-are-taking-on-gas-plants-to-power-californias-nights) to absorb its still-growing share of solar power for use after the sun goes down, relieving the evening “net-peak” challenges of previous years.
In a “rapid clean energy deployment, expansion of battery storage, and strategic efforts to build up emergency reserves” have put the state on solid footing for this summer. But the commission is also striving to dramatically expand the state’s capacity for getting customers to help the grid, with a goal of 2030.
“Innovative programs like DSGS provide a critical buffer for ensuring the reliability of California’s electrical grid while reducing emissions,” California Energy Commission Vice Chair Siva Gunda said in an 500 megawatts of enrolled capacity.
Anne Hoskins, senior vice president of policy and market development at Generac Power Systems, highlighted the risks that programs like DSGS insure against. Generac, one of the country’s biggest manufacturers of backup generators, has [2021 acquisition of startup ecobee](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/generac-acquires-smart-themostat-maker-ecobee).
Back in 2022, when Gov. Newsom’s office sent out emergency text alerts to Californians to turn down power in the face of a potential grid overload, Generac tapped into ecobee’s automated grid-response capabilities to help meet the call, Hoskins said.
“With this DSGS funding, we can provide that in a more efficient way,” she said.
The costs to the state of keeping DSGS healthy in future years pale compared to the economic risks of leaving California open to future grid emergencies, Hoskins added. She cited a 2022 added more than $1 billion in energy costs to utility customers that “would have been avoided if there were additional capacity online to meet the increased demand.”
“You’re looking at potentially multi-billion-dollar impacts that could be avoided by calling on these distributed resources,” Hoskins said. “We recognize that California is in a challenging situation” with its budget. But before state lawmakers take away DSGS money, she’d like to see an analysis of “the alternative costs for this program going away if the money isn’t there for customers.”

The cost of keeping California’s power grid up and running is skyrocketing, and in turn, “sweet spots” on the grid.
So finds a “load flexibility.” Think tank GridLab published the study in collaboration with Kevala, a grid-focused data analytics startup.One of the main reasons utilities’ expenses are rising is that the companies are putting more money toward their distribution grids — the poles, wires, and transformers that deliver power from electrical substations to homes.
Spending on distribution grids has grown rapidly in the past decade, and made up 44% of total utility spending in 2023, 
The distribution grid is an even greater expense in California, according to Ric O’Connell, founding executive director of GridLab. Utilities there must invest heavily in wildfire-prevention measures, and the state’s ambitious decarbonization goals mean the power system needs to support the rapid electrification of homes and vehicles.
If California can defer upgrades to its distribution system, it can produce savings for customers, O’Connell said.
“That’s where the money is,” he said. All things being equal, “deferring the greatest number of highest-cost grid upgrades will save the most money.”
And according to GridLab’s new study, the best way to defer the most upgrades is to find those grid sweet spots — specifically, the areas with circuits, transformers, and substations that are _least_ strained — and rapidly scale up virtual power plant programs to serve them.
Kevala, the startup that partnered with GridLab on the study, has a decent idea of where those sweet spots might be, based on its past analyses of [distribution grids in California](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/crunching-data-to-keep-evs-from-overloading-californias-grid) and 
The new study looks at the ideal way to deploy the 3.5 gigawatts of “load shift” capacity that California 
For the research, Kevala compiled data on every feeder line, substation transformer, and substation of California’s three biggest utilities from today through 2030. It then ran three scenarios for using that 3.5 GW of load flexibility to relieve strain on that infrastructure: spreading the VPP effort equally across the grid, targeting the most overloaded parts of the grid first, and prioritizing the least overloaded parts.
That last technique was by far the most cost-effective, the analysis showed. Putting it into practice could reduce grid costs passed on to utility customers by a total of $13.7 billion through 2030 — about $10 billion more than the alternative approaches.
The reason? Taking on the least overloaded circuits first allows the same amount of load flexibility to defer new investments across a wider swath of the low-voltage grid, O’Connell said. The strategy also happens to target more urban areas, where much of the grid is buried underground, making it more expensive and difficult to upgrade.
## **Reversing the status-quo approach for “non-wires alternatives”**
That result came as something of a surprise.
“At first, we thought you’re going to start with the most heavily overloaded circuits and allocate flexibility to those, and then work your way down,” O’Connell said. “But we found you basically exhaust your flexibility on a handful of circuits — and you’re basically not saving a lot of money.” For those instances, “maybe it makes sense to spend real money on poles and wires.”
VPPs may also struggle to meet the challenge of deferring investments in the most strained parts of the grid, he noted. The history of these efforts appears to bear that out.
For more than a decade, utilities and regulators have been working on so-called “2014, “distributed energy resources” — DERs for short — into their multibillion-dollar annual spending plans.
But beyond some showcase projects like New York utility Con Edison’s “nothing’s really happened,” O’Connell said. Critics say the lack of progress is largely because utilities have proposed 
On the other hand, “there are many circuits that are overloaded on a few hours of very hot days. I just need a little bit of DERs to solve that,” O’Connell said. “If we have a limited amount of valuable load flexibility, we should sprinkle a little bit of it across these lightly overloaded circuits.”
Targeting the least overloaded circuits could also minimize the risk of VPPs falling short of the job, he said. Slightly overloaded transformers and power lines can undergo overload conditions for short periods of time without blowing up or breaking down.
Larger-scale non-wires alternative projects like those that have been targeted in the past have a slimmer margin of error, he said. Utilities have traditionally demanded that any DERs being deployed to solve those grid constraints be made available for that purpose to the exclusion of any other use.
That’s a tough sell for customers of the companies putting VPPs together. Most consumers buy batteries for emergency backup power or to store surplus solar power — not to turn them over completely to utility control.
Customers willing to enroll their EV chargers, air conditioners, water heaters, and other appliances in flexibility programs would likely balk at the idea of being unable to use their devices when they really need to. Past VPP initiatives show that customers are far less likely to stick with them if they aren’t able to “opt out” of particular dispatches when circumstances demand it — say, when they need to charge their EV quickly after work to take their kid to soccer practice, or keep the house cool when elderly relatives are visiting.
With less-overloaded parts of the grid, by contrast, “maybe we can get the utilities a little bit more relaxed about it,” O’Connell said. “They’re always worried about, ‘What if the DERs don’t show up?’”
## **Building load flexibility into grid plans**
There’s a big catch when it comes to putting insights like these into action, however, said Kevala CEO Aram Shumavon. Utilities in California and elsewhere haven’t yet built VPPs and DERs into how they plan investments. That makes it much harder for the companies to consider them as options — which means they wind up choosing the traditional grid upgrade instead.
That’s the safer tried-and-true choice — and utilities, with their “extreme aversion to quantify risk, struggle with making innovative decisions,” he said. “But we’re spending a lot of time right now on what feels like baby steps, compared to how this market as a whole will need to function.”
It’s taken years for California utilities to start using the inherent flexibility of these technologies to help with grid operation and planning. But now, after some experimentation, they’re starting to prove that [EV charging hubs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/a-new-way-to-fix-grid-bottlenecks-for-ev-charging-flexible-connection), [distributed solar installations](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/distributed-energy-resources/californias-new-rules-allow-solar-and-batteries-to-help-out-the-grid), and 
Still, VPP and DER programs are simply not expanding fast enough to meet California’s needs, Shumavon contends. “Once you move it into a program or procurement that requires a larger amount of situational awareness, we are woefully behind where we should be as an industry.”
Even getting the grid data needed for VPP providers to know where their solar-charged batteries or controllable household loads could do the most good has been a challenge. State legislators recently [killed a bill provision](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/california-amend-legislation-utility-bills) that would have required California’s three major utilities to share data to inform how VPPs can reduce grid costs.
But Shumavon thinks that utilities in California are coming around to the need to move faster. The “non-wires alternatives” concept arose decades ago, when electricity demand was largely flat across most of the United States, and utilities had little incentive to support an alternative to investing more in their grids, which is how they earn guaranteed profits.
But that situation has radically changed in the past few years. The AI boom requires grids to handle gigawatts of new power, and utility rates are rising across the country. “The risk they’re facing is that they can’t do the rate increases, and they still have to deploy more capital, which has an upward pressure on rates,” Shumavon said. “That’s the point at which politicians get angry.”
O’Connell agreed that “utilities are much more interested in doing this now. They’re seeing rate pressure being a much bigger deal for them now. Anything they can do, it means that billions less in capital spend will show up.”
But the recent study by GridLab and Kevala “wasn’t going to get into how you design the program and how you pay them,” he said. “It’s more like, ‘You can do this — let’s figure it out.’”","Virtual power plants, Distributed energy resources, Utilities, West, California",reduce-costs-california-distribution-grid-study.md,articles_virtual-power-plants

The rooftop solar industry is facing an unprecedented crisis. Utilities are [have gone bankrupt](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/sunnova-mosaic-bankruptcies-industry-challenges). And sweeping legislation just passed by Republicans in Congress will soon [cut off federal tax credits](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/rooftop-solar-braces-for-fallout-from-trumps-megabill) that have supported the sector for 20 years.

Sachu Constantine, executive director of nonprofit advocacy group Vote Solar, thinks that the rooftop solar and battery industries can survive and even thrive if they focus their efforts on becoming “[virtual power plants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants).”

Right now, there aren’t many other options for meeting soaring energy demand, he added. The megabill signed by President Donald Trump this month [undermines the economics](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/wind-solar-construction-trump-tax-credits) of the utility-scale solar and battery installations that make up the vast majority of new energy being added to the grid.

Solar and batteries, clustered in small-scale community energy projects or scattered across neighborhoods, may be “the only viable way to meet load growth” from data centers, factories, and broader economic activity, Constantine said. And by relieving pressure on utility grids, they can help bring down costs not just for those who install them, but for customers at large.
## **Where VPPs are already saving the day**
This summer has brought new proof of how customers can turn their rooftop solar systems and batteries to the task of rescuing their neighbors from energy emergencies. Over the past two months, Puerto Rico grid operator LUMA Energy has relied on participants in its 
“Last night we successfully dispatched approximately 70,000 batteries, contributing around 48 megawatts of energy to the grid,” LUMA wrote in a July 9 50 MW, that dispatch helped avert “multiple load shedding events” — the industry term for rolling blackouts.
Puerto Ricans have been [installing solar and batteries at a rapid clip](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/puerto-ricans-are-powering-their-own-rooftop-solar-boom) since 2017, when Hurricane Maria devastated the island territory’s grid and left millions of people without power, some for nearly a year.
“There were tens of thousands of batteries already there that just needed to get connected in a more meaningful way,” said Shannon Anderson, a policy director focused on virtual power plants at Solar United Neighbors, a nonprofit that helps households organize to [secure cheaper rooftop solar](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/how-neighborhoods-are-banding-together-to-get-cheaper-rooftop-solar). “The numbers have been really proven out this summer in terms of what it’s been able to do.”
Puerto Rico’s VPPs are managed by aggregators — companies that install solar and battery systems and control them to support the grid. Tesla Energy, one such aggregator, provides 
The impacts of distributed solar and batteries aren’t always so easy to track — but clean-energy advocates are busy calculating where they’re making a difference.
During last month’s heat wave across New England, as power prices spiked and grid operators sought to import energy from neighboring regions, distributed solar and batteries [reduced stress on the grid](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/northeast-heat-wave-solar-battery-benefits). Nonprofit group Acadia Center estimated that 20 million in costs by driving down energy consumption and suppressing power prices.

All told, that scattered infrastructure gives the company 72 extra megawatts of capacity to play with during grid emergencies.

Choosing to hire Powell indicated the company’s growing interest in becoming something of a [solar-powered utility](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/newsletter-sunruns-plan-to-become-a-solar-powered-utility#:~:text=Sunrun%20has%20brought%20solar%20power,percent%20carbon-free%20by%202025.).

“We are living in the future of virtual power plants in places like Puerto Rico, and California, and New England, and increasingly Texas,” said Chris Rauscher, Sunrun’s head of grid services and electrification. “It’s just about other states putting that in place in their territories and letting it run.”
## **Getting states to embrace VPPs**
Sunrun, Vote Solar, and Solar United Neighbors have been working for the last year to [advance state policies that support VPPs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/heres-a-blueprint-for-building-virtual-power-plants-in-every-state). So far this year, the groups have promoted 
In May, 450 megawatts of VPP capacity, including at least 15 MW of home batteries, Anderson said.
The legislative effort has had less luck in New Mexico and Minnesota, where bills failed to advance, Anderson said. In Illinois, a 
A lot more batteries are being added to rooftop solar systems in Illinois, Anderson noted — a byproduct of the state [played out in Hawaii](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/hawaii-used-rooftop-solar-to-shore-up-the-grid-new-rules-threaten-that) and [California](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/more-batteries-less-solar-californias-solar-turmoil-in-charts) after regulators reduced the value of solar power that customers send back to the grid, making batteries that can store extra power and further limit customers’ grid consumption much more popular.
Rooftop solar advocates have fought hard to retain net-metering programs across the country. But Jenny Chase, solar analyst with BloombergNEF, noted that most mature rooftop solar markets have shifted away from rewarding customers for sending energy back to the grid at times when it’s not needed.
“In some ways that’s justified, because net metering pushes all responsibility and cost of intermittency onto the utility,” she said.
VPPs flip this dynamic, turning rooftop solar and batteries from a potentially disruptive imposition on how utilities manage and finance their operations to an active aid in meeting their mission of providing reliable power at a reasonable cost. Utilities have traditionally been leery of trusting customer-owned resources to meet their needs. But under pressure from lawmakers and regulators, they’re starting to embrace the possibilities.
In Minnesota, utility Xcel Energy has [proposed a “distributed capacity procurement” program](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/xcel-minnesota-looks-to-mimic-power-plants-with-solar-and-storage) that would allow it to own and operate solar and batteries installed at key locations, letting the company defer costly grid upgrades. Rooftop solar advocates have [mixed feelings about the proposal](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/distributed-energy-resources/we-need-distributed-solar-and-energy-storage-not-utility-monopolies), given their longstanding complaints about Xcel’s track record of making it 
Similar tensions are at play in Colorado, where Xcel is “taking these thousands of batteries we have connected to this system over time and [being] able to use them to respond to local issues,” Emmett Romine, the utility’s vice president of customer energy and transportation solutions, told Canary Media in an April interview.
But waiting for utilities to deploy the grid sensors, software, and other technology needed to perfectly control customers’ devices runs the risk of delaying the growth of VPPs, Anderson said. Simpler approaches like those being taken in Puerto Rico — where aggregators manage VPPs — can do a lot of good quickly. “Once you get that to scale, there will be a lot of learnings for the next stage,” she said
## **Blunting the impact of tax credit cuts**
State- and utility-level incentives that encourage individuals to participate in VPPs are also a vital countermeasure against [the damage incurred](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/tax-credit-changes-trump-law) by the “big, beautiful bill” passed by Republicans this month, Anderson said. Under that law, households will [lose a 30% tax credit](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/use-tax-credits-evs-home-before-gone) that offsets the cost of solar, batteries, and other home energy systems by the end of this year.
However, companies such as Sunrun and Tesla will retain access to tax credits for solar systems that they own and provide to customers through leases or power purchase agreement structures, as long as they begin construction by mid-2026 or are placed in service by the end of 2027. And tax credits for batteries remain in place until 2033 for these companies.
VPP programs can’t make up for the loss of the tax credit for customers who haven’t yet installed solar or batteries, Anderson said. But by financially rewarding participants, they can help consumers recoup initial costs, she said, as long as they aren’t hampered by ineffective state policies.
“Folks can earn over $1,000 a summer through [some VPPs],” she said. “You couple in the leasing model for solar and storage, which is going to get a little more popular in the aftermath of the bill,” due to its ability to continue to earn tax credits, “and I think it’s a pretty good way to get batteries for low or no cost up front.”","Virtual power plants, Batteries, Solar",rooftop-solar-industry-trump-budget-law.md,articles_virtual-power-plants

Three bills have advanced through the California Legislature that are meant to increase the use of virtual power plants as a way to rein in energy costs. While good news for utility customers, that welcomed progress comes with its own dose of bad news: The most ambitious proposals were stripped out of one of the bills in a secretive process inaccessible even to the bill’s author.
Two of the bills, 
But “gutted” last week via an opaque legislative maneuver, Perez said. Those amendments stripped the bill of important provisions that would have required the state’s biggest utilities to provide data to enable them to build virtual power plants into their grid investment plans.
Those provisions “would have helped California get the most out of its existing grid while saving ratepayers billions,” Perez said. “At a time of skyrocketing electricity bills and reliability challenges, California can’t afford to sideline tools that make the grid cleaner, more resilient, and more affordable.”
California has the highest electricity rates in the nation outside of Hawaii. Virtual power plants, which stitch together distributed energy like rooftop solar, home batteries, and EVs, can’t solve that problem on their own. But they can certainly help: A new 3.7 billion to $13.7 billion in 2030, compared to a base case, by using home batteries, EV chargers, and smart thermostats to avoid or defer costly upgrades to power lines and other infrastructure.
The changes made to SB 541 will dramatically reduce the savings it could offer, according to Sen. Josh Becker, the Democrat who authored the bill and chair of the Senate energy committee.
“We’re very disappointed,” he said.
The bill still includes measures to spur utilities to expand their use of VPPs, “so we can avoid overbuilding to meet the highest peaks in demand,” he said. “But we’ve missed an opportunity to do so much more by focusing on the other half of the problem — all this spending on upgrading poles and wires that can be avoided if we take better advantage of distributed energy resources.”
Becker said he didn’t know who was responsible for excising that portion of the bill or why they did it. The amendments were introduced during a 686 bills under consideration, including high-profile ones like a proposal to 
“We’re pursuing every avenue to keep that language alive,” Becker said of the removed text. But there’s little time for lawmakers to secure revisions before Sept. 12, the last day for the Legislature to pass bills this year. 
## **How VPPs can help California’s grid**
For a handful of hours every year in California, often on the hottest days, electricity use soars beyond the usual day-to-day level and hits what’s known as peak demand. To meet these peaks, utilities have historically opted to build more power plants and power lines than they need on a daily basis — an expensive choice that is responsible for a large portion of utility bills.
But California can reduce demand peaks and make a big dent in those costs by taking advantage of solar-charged batteries, smart thermostats, EV chargers, and other devices scattered across homes and businesses. Individual customers are compensated for allowing the rest of the grid to use their energy resources, but if done right, a VPP’s benefits outweigh those payments.
A 15% of California’s peak demand by 2035, saving utility customers about $550 million each year. Most of those savings would flow to those whose clean energy assets are enrolled in the programs, but customers at large would also see costs decline because utilities wouldn’t have to build as much infrastructure.
California [badly needs to cut those costs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/californias-utility-bill-crisis-is-clear-to-all-the-solution-not-so-much). Average residential electricity rates in the state increased 47% from 2019 to 2023 and now stand at nearly [serve data centers](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/data-centers-are-overwhelming-the-grid-could-they-help-it-instead), [EV charging](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/a-big-barrier-to-californias-electric-truck-goals-a-backlogged-power-grid), and home electrification is set to push rates higher still.
In the face of these rising costs, “making better use of what’s already on the grid rather than building something from scratch is a pretty important consideration,” said Ryan Hledik, a principal at Brattle and lead author of the study.
But California is not on track to meet its VPP targets. In 2023, the California Energy Commission (CEC), acting to comply with a law passed the previous year, set a CEC’s June 3.5 gigawatts, or about half the 2030 goal.
The state isn’t likely to reach its 7-GW target under “business-as-usual” conditions, the CEC report found. That’s especially true if the [policymakers decide to eliminate programs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/california-demand-side-grid-support-benefits) created after [grid emergencies in 2020 and 2022](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/californians-saved-the-grid-again-they-should-be-paid-more-for-it), which have grown fastest in recent years compared to utility-managed VPPs. The report concludes that California needs “additional near-term strategies” to close the gap.
## **The latest attempt to build VPPs into grid spending plans**
SB 541 was designed to help fill that gap.
In particular, the bill was meant to 
The amended bill still requires the California Energy Commission to create regulations to track the progress toward the 7-GW goal by utilities, community energy providers, and other “load-serving entities” supplying power to customers. “We need to know which load-serving entities are doing a good job of it, and learn from the best practices,” Becker said.
But the original version of SB 541 also called on the California Public Utilities Commission to create regulations to require the state’s three major utilities to share data on their low-voltage distribution grids, and use that data to discover how VPPs can reduce the cost of managing that infrastructure. Last week’s amendments entirely cut this portion of the bill.
Brad Heavner, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association trade group, said that’s a missed opportunity. Today’s VPPs and demand-response programs are triggered to reduce pressure on the state’s transmission grid and generator fleets when energy demand exceeds supply, he said. In other words, they’re “focused on times when we may not have enough energy statewide,” which is “obviously important.”
But as originally written, SB 541 would have required a more proactive approach that integrates VPPs into grid planning.
“From an affordability perspective, most of the reason our rates have increased is due to utility overspending on the distribution grid,” he said. “VPP programs should be equally focused on using networked batteries to avoid the cost of expanding substations and other big infrastructure.”
Getting utilities to do this has been a longtime challenge. For more than a decade, California regulators have been 
But as Hledik told a California Assembly committee in July in testimony supporting SB 541, “attempts to use load flexibility as a distribution system resource have had limited success.” Existing programs aimed at requiring utilities to seek out DERs that can 
SB 541 was designed to overcome those previous pitfalls, Hledik said, by requiring that “load flexibility opportunities be considered earlier and more comprehensively in distribution planning.”
The other VPP bills don’t take on distribution grid costs. AB 740 would require the CEC to adopt a virtual power plant deployment plan by November 2026, in collaboration with state grid operator CAISO, the utilities commission, and an advisory group representing disadvantaged communities.
”It doesn’t require them to implement anything specifically,” said Perez of Advanced Energy United. “But it does require that cross-agency deep dive that is just not happening right now.”
AB 44, which Advanced Energy United also supports, is “more surgical,” Perez said. It would order the CEC to adopt a method to value VPPs as a means of reducing “
Resource adequacy costs are rising across California. A handful of [community choice aggregators](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/guides-and-how-tos/power-by-people-glossary-bundle#community-choice-aggregator) (CCAs), the city- and county-level entities that [procure clean energy](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/24-7-carbon-free-energy-is-about-to-become-a-reality-in-california) for a growing number of the customers of California’s big three utilities, have [worked with CEC to prove that their VPPs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/californias-patchwork-push-to-scale-up-virtual-power-plants) function well enough to count toward resource adequacy. The CEC has then reduced their requirements accordingly, which has allowed CCAs to cut their customers’ energy bills.
That’s a useful route to capturing the value of VPPs, Perez said. But it’s largely been done on an ad-hoc basis to date, and “there’s no clear process” for other CCAs to follow suit, he explained. “AB 44 tries to make that process more transparent.”
None of the bills have passed yet. If they can clear the Legislature by mid-September, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) will have until Oct. 12 to sign the legislation into law. 
This isn’t state lawmakers’ first attempt to pass VPP bills.
Similar efforts [failed to advance](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/california-could-cut-utility-bills-with-distributed-energy-why-isnt-it) in last year’s legislative session, as did bills aimed at restricting utility spending. Utilities earn guaranteed profits for every dollar they spend on power grids and other capital infrastructure, which incentivizes them to resist VPP policies that might reduce those expenses — and California’s utilities have political heft in state government.
But Becker, who is also [pushing legislation to offset utility spending](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/california-lawmakers-have-a-radical-idea-for-lowering-electricity-bills) through public financing in this year’s legislative session, said the state’s utilities are already [struggling to expand their grids](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/california-lawmakers-have-a-radical-idea-for-lowering-electricity-bills) quickly enough to serve large new customers like EV charging depots and data centers.
In other words, they can’t spend money fast enough to build the grid that’s needed right now. “We’re just trying to align the rules of the game to reward good behavior,” he said.","Virtual power plants, Distributed energy resources, Policy regulation, West, California",california-amend-legislation-utility-bills.md,articles_virtual-power-plants

Across California, hundreds of homes and businesses have signed up their solar panels, batteries, EVs, and appliances to be part of “[virtual power plants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants)” — networks of scattered energy resources that utilities can control to stave off blackouts and cut electricity prices.
Now, utilities are exploring another way to leverage VPPs: Strategically concentrating the systems in certain areas could let the companies defer expensive upgrades to nearby poles, wires, and other infrastructure. But first, utilities need to be 100% sure they can count on customer-owned assets without risking the grid’s reliability.
That’s the challenge that Northern California utility Pacific Gas Electric is taking on with a pilot program it is running this summer and fall. PGE has years of [experience operating virtual power plants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/pg-e-is-testing-different-flavors-of-virtual-power-plant) to reduce stress across the statewide grid. But the new SAVE) program is testing how customers’ batteries and home energy controls can meet grid needs more precisely, down to the neighborhood level.
PGE hasn’t said how many households it enlisted for the pilot, but in a March press release, the utility said it aimed to enroll up to 1,500 residential customers with [solar-charged batteries](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/rooftop-solar-industry-trump-budget-law) from companies including 400 customers with [smart electrical panels](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/span-edge-smart-panel-utility-meter) from startup 
The local “distribution” grids that serve those customers operate under a variety of conditions, including moments of peak demand that push some of the systems to their limits. Using home batteries and energy controls to delay upgrading those grids could make a big dent in the [high and rising costs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/californias-utility-bill-crisis-is-clear-to-all-the-solution-not-so-much) of electricity in California. In fact, a recent analysis indicates tapping the state’s nation-leading fleet of rooftop solar, backup batteries, and EVs for this task could save [billions of dollars in grid upgrade costs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/reduce-costs-california-distribution-grid-study).
PGE isn’t delaying upgrades on the parts of the grid it’s testing just yet, said Trevor Udwin, the utility’s VPP and grid optimization manager. But the SAVE project will inform next steps to start doing this kind of proactive, VPP-integrated grid planning at a larger scale.
“At some point, we need to build trust,” Udwin said. “That means someone’s signing something” — a commitment to deliver the grid relief needed during specific times — ”and that a distribution planner is changing their operations based on that commitment.”
## **Proving that VPPs can match local grid needs**
Distribution networks are distinct from the huge transmission lines that move the energy produced by power plants over long distances. Local distribution infrastructure instead carries power from substations — the big, fenced-in collections of equipment that lower the voltage of transmission-fed power — along main feeder lines, and eventually to the wires that connect to neighborhoods, homes, and businesses.
Until recently, utilities lacked technologies like smart meters and grid sensors to let them see what’s actually going on on those parts of their grids. That visibility is important, because these distribution networks have unique and fluctuating needs and characteristics — or load shapes, in industry parlance —that determine _where_ and _when_ they may be experiencing problems.
Without that transparency, the traditional utility fix has been to overbuild the system to reduce risks of overloads. But that’s getting expensive as demand for electricity rises. U.S. utilities invest 
It could be much cheaper to instead get a cluster of customers to use less energy or send solar or battery power back to the grid during the handful of hours a particular distribution system is overloaded.
To test that capability, PGE and its SAVE partners are using Sunrun’s batteries and Span’s smart electrical panels to modify how homes participating in the pilot consume and provide electricity to match the hour-by-hour constraints of the grid they’re connected to.
That’s an inherently time- and location-specific challenge, since different grid substations and circuits “may have very different load shapes, and they may peak differently at different hours,” Udwin said. And right now, very few utilities have deployed the data-collecting technology needed to reliably coordinate those interactions across their low-voltage distribution networks.
That technology, referred to as a [distributed energy resource management system](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/ge-snaps-up-opus-one-and-its-operating-system-for-a-fast-changing-grid), or DERMS, does exist. California’s big utilities have run multiple DERMS pilot projects over the years, and PGE has [EV charging hubs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/a-new-way-to-fix-grid-bottlenecks-for-ev-charging-flexible-connection) and “load flexibility” pilots.
But PGE hasn’t yet integrated that DERMS platform with the communications and controls technology it’s deploying with its SAVE partners, Udwin said. Instead, for this summer’s tests, PGE is “building communications with the aggregators,” he said, interfacing with software from [Lunar Energy](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/inside-the-software-running-sunruns-home-solar-battery-fleets) and [Tesla](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/texas-hooked-up-its-first-virtual-power-plants-to-help-the-grid) to control the batteries, and with Span’s software that keeps [whole-home energy use below certain thresholds](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/smart-electric-panels-in-homes-could-prevent-overtaxing-the-grid).
All of that software will be tasked with making sure homes with batteries, panels, and other equipment work together to add power or reduce draws at moments when that section of the grid is expected to experience excessive loads. But it also has to make sure it doesn’t leave customers unable to use their batteries and appliances when they need to, Udwin noted.
PGE and its SAVE partners want to make sure they’re “serving their customers best, and that the load-shaping won’t negatively impact them,” Udwin said. To make that easier, PGE is delivering its partners week-ahead and day-ahead load shape requests, he said. That gives Sunrun and Span an opportunity to prepare their customers for lengthy demands on their resources.
“They’re taking a really big risk with us,” he said. “I’m thrilled our partners are taking this leap.”
## **Capturing the grid savings potential before it’s gone**
California was one of the EV chargers and appliances into grid planning. [Hawaii](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/hawaii-used-rooftop-solar-to-shore-up-the-grid-new-rules-threaten-that), [Minnesota](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/xcel-minnesota-looks-to-mimic-power-plants-with-solar-and-storage), 
Lots of utilities are already using these technologies to reduce system-wide electricity peaks. In fact, [demand-response programs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/guides-and-how-tos/the-power-grid-explained-plus-demand-response-virtual-power-plants-and-more) have existed for decades. But beyond a handful of projects, utilities have yet to leverage VPPs as a way to defer investments in their distribution grids.
Utilities don’t have much time to act on this opportunity for savings, said Aram Shumavon, CEO of grid analytics company Kevala. Even with these kinds of targeted VPPs in place, overloaded grid circuits will need to be upgraded sooner or later, he said. And once they are, VPPs can no longer defer those costs, evaporating the potential savings.
Missing out on those savings could hurt. A 2023 study by Kevala found that upgrading California’s distribution grids without deploying tech and programs to prevent EV charging from overloading local circuits could cost the state’s three big investor-owned utilities [around $50 billion](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/crunching-data-to-keep-evs-from-overloading-californias-grid) by 2035. [Managing EVs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/how-to-make-evs-get-along-with-the-grid?token=CNdirIZy82uLQcTgF-slVY9C-mq3Orf0&x-craft-preview=54460a93229cdd5f55d48b145ba05779ca2ad6647fb2250639d95bda258a6087emvfevcjoc) to avoid those overloads, by contrast, could cut that price tag roughly in half, 
Those savings should more than cover whatever utilities need to pay EV owners to commit to those managed charging constraints, Shumavon said. Eventually, the rising electricity demand from all those new EV-owning customers will [increase utility revenues enough to cover those new grid costs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/evs-will-put-more-stress-on-californias-grid-smart-charging-can-help), lowering rates for customers at large, he added.
To be clear, the lack of uniformity across different parts of the grid makes it hard to pinpoint the precise value of the VPPs the SAVE program is testing. Assessing that value is exceedingly complicated, given the enormous number of variables involved.
VPP advocates argue that utilities and regulators should avoid getting bogged down in those calculations and err in favor of encouraging customers to lend their spare power to help the grid. A new 13.7 billion by 2030 by fully utilizing distributed resources like EVs and solar panels to defer grid upgrades.
However, utilities need to be able to prove out that a VPP’s benefits outweigh the expense of paying customers for access to their energy resources, Udwin said. “We want to find ways to shape for everything we can shape for — and do so cost-effectively. That’s the rub.”
PGE is targeting low-income and disadvantaged communities for at least 60% of its SAVE test cases, Udwin said. There’s a sound rationale for that: Data shows that EV charging.
At the same time, PGE is focusing on parts of the grid where its SAVE partners already have a concentration of customers. California has more rooftop solar, behind-the-meter batteries, and EVs than any other state, which provides a fertile field of latent resources to tap into, said Yang Yu, Sunrun’s director of business development for distributed power plants ([another term](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/heres-a-blueprint-for-building-virtual-power-plants-in-every-state) for VPPs).
“Deploying assets in a small territory can make it difficult [for VPP programs] to reach scale, even with strong customer incentives like a free battery,” he said. But Sunrun has “a ton of assets already deployed,” he said. “That means that, within a specific region — say a substation or even specific feeders — we may have enough penetration at some point to do a local-level peak-load management.”
That’s not just more cost-effective than upgrading utility grids — it’s also faster. “We can stand up a [distributed power plant] in six months,” he said, which is what Sunrun has done for PGE’s SAVE program.","Virtual power plants, Batteries, Utilities, West, California",utilities-california-lower-grid-upgrade-costs.md,articles_virtual-power-plants
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transportation/massachusetts-clean-car-rules-healey,"Massachusetts should uphold the state’s clean car rules, advocates say",1 May 2025,Sarah Shemkus,"Gov. Maura Healey’s administration has already delayed plans for ramping up zero-emissions medium- and heavy-duty truck sales.

More than 60 environmental, business, and housing groups are asking Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, a Democrat, not to delay the state’s commitment to getting more electric vehicles on the road, despite pressure from automakers to do so.
“Massachusetts should not be asked to compromise its policy leadership or economic competitiveness to accommodate private automakers who would prefer to build less efficient, less technologically advanced cars,” wrote Kat Burnham, senior principal at industry association Advanced Energy United, and Jordan Stutt, Northeast senior director for clean transportation advocacy group Calstart, in a letter last week to the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection.
The push to defend the state’s plan to ramp up zero-emissions passenger vehicle sales follows a decision by Healey’s administration in April to postpone enforcement of similar rules encouraging sales of zero-emissions medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.
The regulations are crucial to reaching Massachusetts’ goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, supporters said. Transportation is the state’s largest source of carbon emissions, making up 38% of the total as of 2021, the last year for which full data are available. Getting more EVs on the road, advocates said, would also improve air quality and public health, and save consumers money since EVs cost less than gas-powered cars to fuel and maintain.
“If we roll back these regulations or prevent them from moving forward, we will have dirtier air, more unhealthy communities, and higher costs,” said Kathy Harris, director of clean vehicles, climate, and energy for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
The Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs yesterday issued a statement saying, “We remain committed to working with all stakeholders on a path forward that eases the burden on car customers and dealerships, who are already being harmed by President Trump’s tariffs, while continuing to increase access to affordable electric vehicles and achieve our climate goals.”
The Natural Resources Defense Council will join the Green Energy Consumers Alliance, Union of Concerned Scientists, and Green Latinos to 1 that will explain the regulations, their potential impact, and how residents can let the state know if they want to keep them on track.
The regulation in play is Massachusetts’ iteration of the Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) rule, which became law in California in 2022. The regulation calls for 35% of the light-duty vehicles automakers provide to dealerships to be zero-emissions as of the 2026 model year; the requirement increases every year until it hits 100% in 2035.
California is the only state with the authority to implement vehicle emissions standards stricter than those of the federal government, though other states are allowed to adopt the regulations passed by California. As of today, 11 other states and Washington, D.C., have signed on to ACC II. Combined, these jurisdictions and California account for about 28% of new light-duty vehicle registrations in the country.
In recent months, however, resistance to the regulations has grown, particularly among industry and business groups that claim rules ACC II goals: In the fourth quarter of 2024, EVs made up 35% goal slated to kick in next year.
The U.S. House yesterday voted to ACC II would ban gas-powered cars. In Maryland, Democratic Gov. Wes Moore last month issued an executive order 
Massachusetts advocacy groups are now hustling to make the case that their state should not be the next to waver.
Despite the gap between current sales and the ACC II target, advocates are confident that demand will grow to meet the numbers set out in the regulations. Interest in electric vehicles has steadily risen in recent years: Light-duty EV purchases in Massachusetts rose nearly 50% in 2023 compared with the year prior, though growth slowed in 2024.
“This [opposition] is not coming from consumers. It is coming from companies that are not eager to meet the moment,” Advanced Energy United’s Burnham told Canary Media.
The regulations are also unlikely to limit consumer choices, supporters contend. New gas-powered cars will still be in the mix until 2035, and even then, used gas-powered cars will be available for many years to come. Plus, zero-emissions options are only increasing: There are now 144 different electric models for sale in the U.S., and more are likely to come as ACC II drives up adoption, proponents said.
“There are plenty of light-duty passenger vehicles that are great options,” said Anna Vanderspek, electric vehicle program director for the Green Energy Consumers Alliance. “There is really no way automakers can make an argument that they can’t comply with these regulations.”
Furthermore, Massachusetts has a strong system of electric vehicle incentives and programs that will support the transition, advocates said. A 3,500 to $6,000 to drivers buying new or used EVs. The state has also invested in the 
“There is so much programming and infrastructure there to make it happen,” Burnham said. “There is really a handful of automakers who have procrastinated on preparing, but we can’t afford to procrastinate any longer.”

“Within five years, and with $100 billion in investment, we can satisfy 100% of U.S. demand for battery storage,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, a trade group.
“This is unquestionably an ambitious commitment, but it is absolutely achievable if the private and public sectors work together,” he said. The $100 billion promise represents a major increase in the $10 billion to $15 billion that the American Clean Power Association estimates was invested in U.S. grid battery manufacturing and deployment last year.
As recently as a few months ago, industry analysts largely agreed that a [close the price gap between U.S.-made batteries](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-manufacturing/the-us-clean-energy-manufacturing-revolution-is-real) and those made in China, the world’s main supplier of lithium-ion battery modules, cells, and materials.
These tax incentives, created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, have also helped bolster the [economics of installing large-scale batteries](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/energy-storage-would-win-long-sought-victory-with-inflation-reduction-act) alongside solar power. Solar and batteries are by far the fastest-to-deploy option for utilities seeking to meet rising electricity demand from data centers, factories, electric vehicles, and broader economic growth. The two energy sources [have dominated](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-96-percent-of-new-us-power-capacity-was-carbon-free-in-2024) new additions to the U.S. grid in recent years.

The Department of Energy Loan Programs Office, which has [lent huge sums to battery manufacturers like Eos and Kore Power](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/heres-every-biden-era-energy-loan-now-all-under-threat-from-trump), could soon be 
On Monday, China and the U.S. announced they’d 30%. Manufacturers and developers still lack clarity about what the underlying economics of their business will look like months from today.
As Grumet conceded in a briefing with reporters before the American Clean Power Association’s D.C. media event in April, “there is a remarkable tension right now between probably the best fundamentals for investment in the energy sector that we’ve seen in a generation and the greatest amount of uncertainty that we’ve seen in a generation.”
## **The headwinds holding back the grid battery boom**
When it comes to plugging batteries into the U.S. power grid, tariffs are the most immediate threat by far. The impacts are already showing up in sagging forecasts and postponed projects.
In February, the U.S. Energy Information Administration [more than 18 gigawatts of batteries in 2025](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/chart-us-is-set-to-shatter-grid-battery-records-this-year), up from 11 gigawatts in 2024, continuing what’s been a meteoric increase over the past several years. But the forecast for 2025 grid battery additions has fallen in recent months, at least according to the latest analysis from the American Clean Power Association and consultancy Wood Mackenzie, which is tucked into the end of 100 billion-by-2030 investment pledge. They predict that a little over 13 GW of energy storage will be plugged into the nation’s grid this year.
Several factors play into that drop-off, but the primary one is that 
Monday’s news that the U.S. and China had 145% tariffs that the Trump administration had imposed on China in April will fall to 30% as of Wednesday — at least if the deal holds.
Now, once again, energy storage companies will be recalibrating the economics of their projects, almost all of which currently rely on battery materials or components from China.
“For the next five to seven years, there is no cost-effective, time-critical alternative to battery storage to meet domestic electricity demand,” said David Fernandes, chief financial officer of 120 megawatt-hours of projects in operation and 3 gigawatt-hours in development across the U.S. and Latin America. “That means cells from China.”
Tariffs on Chinese imports simply mean the batteries that the U.S. grid needs “will just be more expensive,” he said, which will in turn drive up electricity prices. 
Regardless of where tariffs settle, they have already disrupted some grid storage projects.
Take Fluence, a major U.S.-based energy storage provider that’s made more than $700 million in commitments to manufacture 2025 revenue forecasts, driven by decisions to “pause U.S. projects under existing contracts” and “defer entry into pending contracts until there exists better visibility and certainty on the tariff environment.”
More delays are on their way, according to Ravi Manghani, senior director of strategic sourcing at 2025, roughly half are “at risk of getting delayed or renegotiated to make the economics work in 2026 and beyond,” he said.
Some larger-scale projects scheduled to come online this year have likely already brought their batteries into the country, escaping the tariff premium, Manghani said. But many that are procuring batteries now for delivery from late 2025 to early 2026 “are indefinitely postponed until we get more clarity around where the tariffs end up, and what happens to non-Chinese manufacturing at large,” he said.
Projects that are being built as part of state-regulated utilities’ broader generation and grid plans may be able to absorb cost increases, he said. But “merchant projects” that are operated by independent power producers in competitive energy markets are “still figuring out if they can pencil out,” he said.
In a Monday email, Manghani updated his view based on the latest news of a U.S.-China trade rapprochement.
“We will have to see if suppliers can actually ship out within this 90-day window,” he wrote. The determination of which countries end up having the most affordable battery components in the long run “will depend not only on which countries have tariffs, but where the tariff percentages exactly land.” Trump’s seesawing on tariffs “just adds another layer of complexity for long-term investments,” Manghani added.
Those dynamics could crimp the rapid pace of development in the competitive energy market of Texas, [the country’s grid energy storage leader](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/how-texas-became-the-hottest-battery-market-in-the-country-energy-storage).
Stephanie Smith, chief operating officer at grid battery developer [summer heat waves while avoiding grid emergencies](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/solar-and-batteries-are-helping-texas-weather-heatwaves-heres-how) that have plagued it in the past.
But it’s going to be harder for Texas, and the rest of the country, to keep rapidly installing grid batteries in the face of rising prices for Chinese batteries. Eolian is scrambling to “source as much outside of China as possible right now” to deal with the tariffs, Smith said. But “obviously, there are some limitations on that.”
Despite the uncertainty and rising prices, utilities and grid operators desperate to meet rising electricity demand have little choice but to build more batteries, said Gary Dorris, CEO and cofounder of clean energy-focused consultancy 
Manufacturers of the turbines used in gas power plants are reporting up to four-year wait times for customers seeking to build power plants not already in the works, Dorris told Canary Media in an email. Solar panels and batteries, by contrast, can be ordered, shipped, and deployed in less than a year.
## **Tariffs and threats to tax credits weigh on U.S. battery manufacturing**
While the specifics of Trump’s tariffs matter — there is, after all, an enormous difference between 156% and 30% tariffs on China — at this point the hardest thing for manufacturers is “the confusion surrounding” trade policy, Dorris said.
Firms are asking, “What are the goals? Will they stay in place? How will other countries react?” he said. “This has created a lot of uncertainty, which suppresses appetite for making large, irreversible capital investment decisions.”
This unpredictability, paired with the immediate price hikes on imported materials and equipment needed to build and expand factories, has 
The American Clean Power Association is tracking 25 major projects to build or expand grid-scale energy storage factories in the U.S., of which 11 are in operation or under construction. Much of this manufacturing capacity is for battery modules, meaning it continues to rely on Chinese battery cells and materials.
“The domestic supply chain is unfortunately going to be at the receiving end of the tariff,” Manghani said. “A lot of the raw materials that would go into domestic batteries, as well as the manufacturing equipment you need to build these cell factories, are still slated to come from China. We don’t have a lot of alternatives yet.”
That dependence on Chinese-made cells underscores just how vulnerable today’s battery-manufacturing industry is to tariffs, Grumet said. Some domestic facilities are also starting to make those cells and refine and manufacture battery materials.
Those include the facilities that Fluence has invested in that are making battery modules, cells, and associated equipment in Utah and Tennessee. It also includes Tesla’s expanding cell-manufacturing capacity from its factories in 
Speaking at the American Clean Power Association’s D.C. event, Michael Snyder, Tesla’s vice president of energy and charging, highlighted the EV and grid battery manufacturer’s advances in lithium iron phosphate cells. These cells are safer and easier to source materials for than nickel manganese cobalt cells and have become the favored technology for [EV batteries](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/a-new-generation-of-cheaper-batteries-is-sweeping-the-ev-industry) and [grid batteries](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/moss-landing-fire-reveals-flaws-in-the-battery-industrys-early-designs) alike.

But those efforts are in their early stages, and they’ll only succeed if they have customers to buy their products — a prospect made less certain by the chill settling in over grid battery deployment.

But the bigger threat to U.S. clean energy deployment and manufacturing is the possibility that Republicans in Congress will undo the tax credits [created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.canarymedia.com/the-inflation-reduction-act-turns-1) to benefit companies that build and deploy lithium-ion batteries and many other clean energy technologies.
Republicans in Congress have pledged to extend tax cuts passed during the first Trump administration that will 780 billion in [clean-energy tax credits is a tempting target](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/what-climate-law-tax-credits-will-be-in-and-out-under-trump-2-0).

These incentives currently boost the economics for grid battery projects [with a 30% base credit on the cost of the up-front investment](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/energy-storage-would-win-long-sought-victory-with-inflation-reduction-act), but developers can get more if the projects obtain a certain amount of materials from domestic suppliers or if they are built in “energy communities” that face losses in jobs and economic activity due to closures of fossil fuel infrastructure. The tax credits have accelerated storage deployments — and boosted demand for batteries from U.S. manufacturers.
But for battery manufacturers, the most vital piece of policy is the [ Advanced Manufacturing Production tax credit](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/climate-bill-could-revolutionize-us-cleantech-manufacturing-heres-how).

The Senate could spare grid storage projects while cutting incentives for wind and solar.

Senate Republicans released a 
In May, House Republicans voted to [slash all the clean power credits](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/house-republicans-nuke-incentives-for-clean-energy-except-nuclear), with some favorable treatment for nuclear plants. The Senate took a more nuanced approach, doing away with credits for cheap but intermittent resources, while continuing to incentivize projects that can generate power on demand.
The Senate version would crank down investment and production tax credits for wind and solar power starting in 2026, reducing them to zero by 2028. But the Senate Finance Committee threw a lifeline to other zero-carbon power plants, allowing hydropower, geothermal, and nuclear to keep their full credits until 2033. Crucially, energy storage was included in that group, which could help grid batteries keep their [meteoric growth streak](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/chart-us-is-set-to-shatter-grid-battery-records-this-year) going.
This effort to continue supporting “firm” power sources, which provide energy even when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing, could be hugely consequential for America’s ability to meet spiking demand for electricity. Companies are racing to build new power plants to serve [AI computing](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/house-republicans-nuke-incentives-for-clean-energy-except-nuclear) and domestic manufacturing (two avowed priorities of the Trump administration), not to mention the widespread electrification needed to address climate change.
The problem is, nuclear construction has stagnated since the [woefully delayed](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear/georgias-big-new-nuclear-reactors-could-be-the-last-built-in-the-us) and [over-budget Vogtle expansion](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear/vogtle-3-nuclear-reactor-is-finally-seriously-for-real-online); hydropower has been essentially frozen for decades; and geothermal is just starting to gain traction thanks to a [handful of startups developing new technologies](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/was-2024-a-breakout-year-for-next-generation-geothermal-energy).
Of the Senate’s chosen few, batteries are the only contender showing real dynamism in energy markets: In just a few years, they’ve jumped from the margins to become the [second-biggest source of new power capacity](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-96-percent-of-new-us-power-capacity-was-carbon-free-in-2024) added to the U.S. grid each year, after solar. Energy storage dominates the queues of projects waiting to hook up to the grid in the next few years in places like California and Texas.
The Senate still needs to debate this proposal and see if it rallies enough votes to pass. Then the Senate and House will have to reconcile their differences. There’s no way to know if the current Senate language will become the law of the land.
Nonetheless, this proposal changes the political landscape for clean energy advocates, by splitting clean energy into winners and losers. It also tacks on requirements around foreign influence that seem conceptually more workable than [the House’s “poison pill” approach](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/republican-tax-bill-credits-china), but that could still thwart actual construction.
## **Splitting storage from solar and wind**
The idea of excluding wind and solar from receiving credits has been percolating over the last few months, though it was easy to miss in a generally turbulent news cycle. In April, U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, a Republican from North Dakota, introduced a bill that she dubbed the “
“Wind and solar are no longer emerging technologies—they’re mature, market-proven, and widely deployed,” Fedorchak said in a statement at the time. “As all the grid operators are saying, we need more dispatchable resources. We must stop providing generous incentives that run contrary to that.”
The legislation didn’t get much attention at the time, and Fedorchak’s House colleagues yanked support from several of the dispatchable options anyway. But she had some historical facts on her side: Wind and solar have enjoyed federal tax structures since the George W. Bush era (incentives for wind actually go back further), when they emerged as a 2023. The technology is clearly the newest of the major power-sector players (excluding the nonexistent nuclear fusion and small modular reactor projects).
On June 3, a cohort of clean, dispatchable power providers chimed in on the debate with a 
“Nuclear energy, geothermal, hydropower, and energy storage stand ready to deliver that reliable power,” said the group, which included novel storage startups [Form Energy](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/long-duration-energy-storage/form-energy-raises-405m-for-its-100-hour-iron-air-batteries) and [Hydrostor](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/massive-underground-air-battery-project-lands-1-76b-doe-award), along with geothermal, nuclear, and hydro firms. “We believe it is possible to advance genuine deficit reduction without sacrificing the reliable, innovative power that American households, businesses, and national security require.”
They never said to throw wind and solar under the bus, but emphasized the particular value in keeping credits for dispatchable resources as senators decided where to cut spending.
## **Will new rules on China scuttle battery financing anyway?**
The House, besides greatly shrinking the timeline for clean energy tax credits, tacked on new requirements that industry insiders decried as impossible to fulfill. The language would block incentives for projects that include any components from a “prohibited foreign entity,” legislative jargon which basically means companies in China. The state of globalized supply chains makes it effectively impossible to build a power plant with that constraint.
The Senate shares the concern about tax credits accruing to Chinese companies, but handled it differently. In its version, the company filing for tax credits cannot be literally or effectively controlled by prohibited foreign entities — that’s a test that U.S.-based developers should, in theory, have no trouble passing. But the text gets very specific on what kinds of arrangements could constitute “effective control” of a project, and calls for the Treasury secretary to issue guidance on how to qualify. That creates ample opportunities for U.S.-controlled storage companies that fulfill the spirit of the law to run afoul of certain sub-clauses.
Additionally, developers must spend a certain amount of the total project cost on products that are not from “foreign entities of concern.” The ratio starts at 40% in 2026, and increases annually from there. Lithium-ion batteries still largely come from China; if a project has to buy those, but can secure the remaining equipment for the power plant from the U.S., they may be able to hit the right ratio. On paper, this rule seems more achievable than the House version, which would penalize firms that use even small, low-value pieces like bolts or cables that originate from China, rather than focusing on critical, high-value components.
Of course, tax credit compliance is the province of well-paid lawyers, who would need to translate the details of the Senate language into actionable legal guidance for companies. The clean energy industry is still reeling from yearslong rulemakings at the Internal Revenue Service that held back many of the investments championed by the Biden administration. Today, the Trump administration has winnowed civil service staff and actively opposed clean energy; it’s hard to imagine IRS rulemaking moving more swiftly under those circumstances.
Storage developers are frantically running the numbers on whether their power plant designs can stay within the guidelines for foreign components, so that they’ll qualify for the tax credits. They also need their financiers to feel confident that they will. Highly prescriptive legislative interference in a high-tech business landscape complicates that process, and could cause investors to pull back until the dust clears.
That’s not to say battery construction will come to a halt without workable incentives. It’s arguably the only dispatchable technology that can be built quickly in the next few years. But saddling the credits with additional bureaucratic requirements would inject extra costs and delays into the industry, at a time when the U.S. desperately needs all the on-demand power it can get.","Energy storage, Batteries, Climatetech finance, Policy regulation",senate-budget-battery-tax-credits.md,articles_energy-storage

LG Energy Solution’s factory in Holland, Michigan, where it just began making lithium iron phosphate battery cells (LG Energy Solution)
The U.S. battery supply chain just got a little stronger.
LG Energy Solution, a division of the major Korean battery manufacturer, is now producing battery cells for grid-scale energy storage at a site in Holland, Michigan. The company spent $1.4 billion to expand the factory, which previously made electric vehicle batteries. At full capacity, the new lines will produce 16.5 gigawatt-hours of lithium iron phosphate cells per year.
“That’s a sizable portion of annual domestic demand for energy storage battery cells,” said Noah Roberts, vice president for energy storage at the American Clean Power Association trade group, who toured the LG factory Tuesday. “It’s a testament and demonstration of the industry’s commitment to onshoring manufacturing and ramping it up in short order.”
The lithium iron phosphate chemistry, often abbreviated as LFP, has grown increasingly popular for stationary storage [and EVs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/a-new-generation-of-cheaper-batteries-is-sweeping-the-ev-industry); it offers fire-safety benefits, durability, and lower costs compared to the typical electric vehicle chemistries, at the expense of some energy density. Until now, American battery customers had to LG’s facility appears to be the largest giga-scale LFP production in the U.S. Japan’s AESC recently launched LFP production at its factory in Smyrna, Tennessee, and Tesla is working to onshore LFP production as well.
As such, LG’s investment is strengthening the U.S. clean energy supply chain at a time of great precariousness, when several other would-be battery manufacturers have failed to deliver.
The plan originated as a way to bolster local supply chains, before Congress passed concerted battery manufacturing incentives, said Jaehong Park, CEO and president of LG Energy Solution Vertech, which focuses on stationary grid storage. But when the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 created incentives for manufacturing and grid storage deployment, LG upped its planned capacity from 4 gigawatt-hours to the eventual 16.5.
The company initially intended to install these manufacturing lines in Arizona, but relocated them to a portion of its Holland facility that had been developed to expand EV battery production, which LG has done there since 2012. By shifting the LFP equipment to the space in Holland, LG could open commercial production a full year earlier than originally planned, noted Tristan Doherty, chief product officer at the storage division.
Now the Holland manufacturing space covers the area of 42 football fields, and will employ 1,700 people when fully staffed. 
LG spent $1.4 billion to expand the Holland, Michigan, facility where it previously made EV batteries for over a decade. (LG Energy Solution)
“It is very clearly a state-of-the-art facility with the most advanced manufacturing that you can have in the United States,” Roberts said.
The LFP products are booked up six months out, and LG is already looking at doubling the production capacity next year, Park said.
## **Factory completed amid tariffs, tax credit turbulence**
Manufacturers took a gamble in betting that the U.S. could reshore the battery production that China has cornered with dedicated industrial policy over the last decade or more. Companies need to build new industrial hubs and train American workers, and then try to match the quality and consistency of the incumbent industry in China.
The Biden administration passed several incentives to reduce the cost premium for “Made in the USA” batteries, including tax credits for purchasing electric vehicles with domestic batteries, and bonus credits for grid storage developers who buy domestic content.
But the current Republican majority in Congress is working to eliminate those policies, to save money for much more costly deficit spending in President Donald Trump’s signature policy bill. Companies like LG that greenlit multibillion-dollar factory investments under one tax credit regime no longer know which rules will apply when they start production.
Doherty acknowledged there’s a great deal of uncertainty at the moment, but said he’s confident in the long-term bet on U.S. battery production.
“It’s clear that the industry is here and it’s here to stay — the question is just what it looks like and what are the nuances to make it work,” he said. “There’s a lot of very big deals that are in the works. Everyone understands, you need to get U.S. battery supply in your supply chain as quickly as possible.”
LG’s factory in Holland, Michigan, is capable of making 16.5 gigawatt-hours of LFP cells annually, which appears to be the largest LFP production site in the U.S. (LG Energy Solution)
Trump’s massive tariffs on China could in theory support domestic producers. But the president has changed his tariff plans from week to week, denying would-be manufacturers the stable business environment they like to see before committing billions of dollars to a yearslong endeavor. Blanket tariffs on China also [inflate the cost of battery materials](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/tariffs-tax-credits-grid-battery-trump), which are almost entirely processed in that country, as well as the cost of battery manufacturing equipment, which also largely originates there.
LG, as a South Korea-based conglomerate, has been able to avoid the negative scrutiny that American politicians have increasingly leveled at Chinese clean energy manufacturers. LG now sources its battery materials for Holland from outside China, and its manufacturing equipment came from Korea and Japan, Park said.
## **Bucking the trend of factory cancellations**
When Trump came into office, the U.S. was on track to [achieve self-sufficiency in battery cell production](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-manufacturing/the-us-clean-energy-manufacturing-revolution-is-real), per a 2024 analysis by Argonne National Laboratory. The U.S. could make 74 gigawatt-hours of lithium-ion battery cells in 2023, but was set to grow that to 1,133 gigawatt-hours by 2030, comfortably more than expected demand.
During Trump’s tenure, though, new manufacturing investments have plummeted compared to the Biden years, and [project cancellations surged to nearly $8 billion](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-manufacturing/trump-ev-battery-factory-cancellations) in the first quarter of 2025. In that time, for instance, Freyr Battery [axed a lithium-ion factory](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/kore-power-has-a-new-plan-after-canceling-1-2b-battery-plant-in-arizona) slated for Arizona.
Elsewhere in Michigan, startup Our Next Energy [has been laboring](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-manufacturing/clean-energy-manufacturing-in-michigan-is-just-ramping-up) to build the first large LFP factory in the U.S. But it has yet to secure the funding necessary to fill out the cavernous building it acquired west of Detroit, and the company is struggling to stay afloat.
Energy, Kore Power, and Our Next Energy share something in common: They are venture capital-backed startups attempting to compete with the incumbents of the global battery industry. That model hasn’t produced a standout success yet — even Tesla initially tapped an incumbent, Panasonic, to make EV batteries at its Nevada Gigafactory.
The achievement at Holland looks rather modest compared to LG Energy Solution’s global portfolio, which Doherty said has reached around 500 gigawatt-hours of annual battery production.
“As a big company with a big balance sheet, we can have the confidence to say we’ll weather this storm,” Doherty said. “We’ll make it to the other end because we see where this is going.”
LG’s customers may have more difficulty riding out the turbulence of constantly changing tariffs and tax policy.
“This is a market that is growing, and any disruption that causes it to contract is something that will harm manufacturing,” Roberts said of the grid storage construction sector.","Energy storage, Batteries, Clean energy manufacturing, Midwest, Michigan",lg-michigan-lfp-battery-factory.md,articles_energy-storage
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/powin-bankrupt-grid-batteries,Powin fueled the US grid storage boom. Then the company crashed.,24 July 2025,Julian Spector,"The Oregon-based battery firm filed for bankruptcy this summer, jeopardizing its 11.3 gigawatt-hours of storage projects installed around the world. 
Beyond the U.S., Powin has supplied batteries for pathbreaking projects in countries from Australia to Mexico. (Powin)
Southern California’s grid needed help in the fall of 2016. The region was still reeling from the calamitous Aliso Canyon gas leak, and its power plants faced a potential shortfall of that fuel to meet air-conditioning demand when the next summer rolled around. The state 
Big names like Tesla and AES stepped in to help, 2 megawatts of batteries in a warehouse it owned in Orange County.
This proved to be a launchpad for the firm, which rose to the upper echelons of the booming U.S. battery industry before crashing down to earth last month.
After that Orange County installation, Powin refocused on importing battery cells from China and integrating them into grid storage systems, fully packaged with inverters, controls, and safety systems. Powin went on to deliver battery enclosures for many pathbreaking projects: It supplied the [landmark utility-endorsed battery fleet in Arizona](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/batteries/arizonas-largest-utility-restarts-grid-battery-development-after-fire), and a [truly mammoth system in Australia](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/australia-to-replace-coal-plant-with-record-busting-850mw-battery), to name just a few of Powin’s self-reported KKR.
And then in June, Powin filed for bankruptcy, alerting the state of Oregon of mass layoffs at its Tualatin campus, outside Portland. The news jolted the storage industry, since so many major grid storage plants run on Powin’s hardware and software. The bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing, but storage software specialist FlexGen has placed a bid to buy Powin’s assets at auction in early August, offering Powin customers a way to keep their batteries running.
Cleantech bankruptcies have flourished under the second Trump presidency, and the storage sector is uniquely exposed. The industry runs almost entirely on imported battery cells from China, making it vulnerable to rapidly shifting trade policies. The Biden administration raised tariffs on Chinese batteries, and President Donald Trump cranked the overall rate on Chinese imports as high as 145% in April, though he has altered the rate repeatedly in the opening months of his presidency. Trump’s budget law preserved tax credits for installing grid batteries but added a [new bureaucratic regime](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/china-foreign-entity-rules-trump) to regulate the amount of China-derived equipment in those storage plants.
“The business model of integrating batteries into a full storage system is one of these classic high-volume, low-margin businesses,” said Pavel Molchanov, a Raymond James analyst covering cleantech companies. “Margins were low even before Trump and these new tariffs on China, and now it’s a safe bet that their margins have been squeezed even further.”
Nonetheless, Powin’s collapse stands out for the scale of the company’s reach — and raises serious questions. Is Trumpian chaos enough to unseat a leading battery supplier, even as the market for grid batteries [continues to surge](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/chart-us-is-set-to-shatter-grid-battery-records-this-year)? Or did Powin’s leadership make choices that ultimately led to its early demise? And perhaps more important, what’s going to happen to those 11.3 gigawatt-hours Powin installed before it went bankrupt?
## **Major growth, then signs of trouble**
Powin got to the big leagues by spotting technological trends before they hit the energy-storage mainstream.
That started with the rapid-fire California installations in 2016, when hardly anyone was building large-scale storage. At the time, American developers looked to a handful of Tier 1 battery suppliers, like LG, Samsung, and Panasonic. Powin instead scoured China for manufacturers that American buyers hadn’t discovered yet but that could match key quality metrics. Powin signed an early supply deal with a firm called Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., or CATL, which has since become far better known in the West as the world’s largest battery maker.
Powin also focused on the then-lesser-known lithium ferrous phosphate (LFP) chemistry, which executives hailed as safer and longer-lasting than the mainstream nickel-based chemistries handed down from the electric vehicle supply chain. Powin imported these LFP cells from trusted vendors in China, installed them in engineered metal cabinets in Tualatin, then delivered them to project sites across the U.S. and, later, the world.
By the 2020s, U.S. storage installations were growing at a shocking rate. To keep pace with soaring demand, Powin 2021 from investors Trilantic Capital Partners and Energy Impact Partners, followed by [$135 million in 2022](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/grid-energy-storage-is-still-pulling-in-big-bucks-recession-be-damned), led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC.
The firm’s first major public setback came when a Powin-supplied battery system in Warwick, New York, [burst into flames](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/batteries/new-york-is-reeling-from-its-hot-battery-summer) after a summer storm in 2023. Days later, authorities 
Developer Convergent Energy and Power owned both systems, and its investigation concluded that a manufacturing flaw in that generation of Powin’s Centipede battery container let water leak in and start electrical fires. Those incidents prompted the Warwick Village Board to 
It’s unclear what kind of financial impact the fallout from those fires had on Powin, but the firm subsequently found itself locked in a legal dispute with none other than its longtime supplier, CATL. That company sued Powin in Oregon Circuit Court in December 2024 for $44 million in allegedly unpaid bills, following an earlier arbitration on the matter in Hong Kong.
The circuit court noted in February that Powin “does not deny that they owe money to CATL” and that “it is apparent to the court that the amount of money Powin owes to CATL exceeds the value of the assets Powin holds in Oregon.” That’s not a great sign for a company’s metabolism.
In a CATL was refusing to honor the contracts and instead tried to spring non-contracted price hikes at the last minute: “CATL effectively held Powin hostage to choosing between negotiating a solution with CATL or breaching contracts with its customers.”
## **The changing battery-storage landscape**
In the same suit, the Powin lawyers proposed a nefarious explanation for the souring relationship with CATL, one that sheds light on a broader challenge Powin faced in the maturing storage market.
“Powin finds it highly suspect that the timing of this filing for pre-judgment remedies comes as CATL is aiming to compete directly with Powin to supply complete energy storage systems, moving beyond its historical business model of supplying subcomponents to Powin and others like Powin.”
Powin championed CATL’s battery cells to the U.S. market when buyers still had hang-ups about sourcing high-quality batteries from China. But CATL, recently valued at more than $180 billion, did indeed move beyond simply shipping cells and began competing directly with Powin. CATL launched a containerized storage product in 2023, and in May it rolled out a new 9-megawatt-hour, double-decker grid battery enclosure called 
“The past few months have presented considerable headwinds for system integrators, even without considering company-specific challenges,” said Ravi Manghani, senior director of strategic sourcing at data firm Anza Renewables. “The increasing number of battery [original equipment manufacturers] entering the U.S. market with attractively priced DC blocks and AC solutions has put pressure on the traditional value proposition of system integrators.”
Other sources in the grid storage industry noted that Powin’s quality had suffered in the scale-up, lowering customer interest in its products. The company had always had a smaller balance sheet than competitors like Tesla, Fluence, and Wärtsilä, all of which are publicly traded and worth billions.
Longtime Powin CEO Geoff Brown, who led the company from 2016 through its dynamic growth phase, [SunPower went bankrupt](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/sunpower-a-solar-icon-once-valued-in-the-billions-files-for-bankruptcy) last year, and Maxeon’s valuation has tumbled precipitously from its 2023 levels.
Last fall, Powin turned to the credit business at KKR, a private-equity trailblazer famous for record-busting leveraged buyouts like RJR Nabisco in the 1980s and utility TXU in the 2000s.
“The facility will be instrumental in supporting Powin’s working capital needs, driving continued innovation, and further enhancing the company’s financial flexibility as it expands its leadership position in the storage industry,” KKR said in a press release from October announcing the $200 million facility.
It’s a strange thing when a company that just secured ample working capital then runs out of working capital just a few months later. Sources familiar with Powin’s business said the debt package, paradoxically, hastened the company’s demise.
Powin drew on only about $25 million of the available debt, but the deal company leadership accepted was “very ugly” and “poorly structured” for Powin’s purposes, said one former Powin customer granted anonymity to speak on sensitive business matters. Another grid storage veteran, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, likened the situation to a payday loan: “They got upside down, and KKR called it in.”
KKR declined to comment on the specifics of Powin’s debt facility.
Powin wouldn’t be the first cleantech company that failed after getting behind on its debt payments. Major rooftop solar provider Sunnova increasingly turned to corporate debt to raise cash as the market soured, then struggled to find cash for debt payments and [fell into bankruptcy](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/sunnova-mosaic-bankruptcies-industry-challenges) in June. Electric bus maker Proterra piled up corporate debt before its [bankruptcy filing](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/bankrupt-ev-bus-maker-proterra-finds-buyers-for-its-business-units) in 2023. When it’s time to pay the tab, even a promising customer pipeline is no legal tender.
## **Action needed to keep the batteries running**
Powin’s financial collapse triggered an existential question for all the storage plants out there running on its hardware and software.
“Everyone’s trying to figure out how to maintain their products and solutions and not have bricked systems,” the former customer said.
Software needs updates, as anyone with an iPhone is repeatedly reminded, and the same goes for the systems that tell huge banks of batteries when to charge and discharge. Energy market rules change; hardware trips up. If Powin simply ceased to exist, it would jeopardize the reliability of all the critical power plants running on its control systems.
But those anxious battery owners may soon get some relief now that software startup FlexGen became a stalking horse bidder in June, proposing to buy “substantially all” of Powin’s assets for $36 million. It’s also lending money to keep Powin operating in the meantime. There will still be an auction, and other firms could bid more. But if all goes according to plan, this process will conclude by early August.
FlexGen CEO Kelcy Pegler said he had great respect for Powin, and “gratitude for them being an early mover” in the grid storage industry.
“Powin was such a substantial part of the market,” Pegler told Canary Media. “FlexGen’s interest is in making sure the customers have a successful path to continuous operations.”
FlexGen, based in Durham, North Carolina, employs some 120 software engineers to constantly maintain and improve its storage management software, Hybrid OS, Pegler noted; that product works on whatever storage hardware the customer wants to operate. If the bid goes through, FlexGen will first provide Powin customers with a “continuity plan” that keeps systems running as they are, and customers will have the option to sign new long-term service agreements with FlexGen.
Customers will have good reason to switch over to FlexGen’s flagship product, Pegler added: An 2023.
As for the business of buying battery cells and turning them into storage plants, Pegler is happy to leave that to the existing field of storage manufacturers. He plans to stick to software and services.
Powin has let go of much of its staff. The founders will lose their stakes, and the venture capitalists and private-equity investors won’t rake in a multiple on their few hundred million dollars invested. But a sale to FlexGen would protect Powin’s physical legacy: The gigawatt-hours of batteries installed across the world could keep on humming, as the energy storage market careens ever onward.","Energy storage, Climatetech finance",powin-bankrupt-grid-batteries.md,articles_energy-storage
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/redwood-used-batteries-data-center,Redwood Materials built record grid storage project using old EV batteries,2 July 2025,Julian Spector,"The EV battery recycler determined it could make good money by repurposing old battery packs for the grid, and found an eager data center customer.

RENO, Nev. — I was supposed to be looking at the largest energy-storage installation ever assembled from used electric-vehicle batteries, the tantalizing new side project of former Tesla Chief Technology Officer JB Straubel’s recycling juggernaut, 
My Redwood tour guide assured me, however, that we were in the right place. Underneath those white shrouds were 792 individual EV battery packs, wired up in long rows and spread across two acres on the firm’s campus outside Reno, Nevada. The plastic wrapping was meant to protect them from the dust. Nearby was a field of solar panels laid flat on the ground, making it hard to gauge just how far back they went. These panels convert sunlight to electricity and store it in the array of old car batteries, to power a miniature data center that a startup named Crusoe built in the same field as the batteries. Any surplus power flows to Redwood’s own facilities surrounding the installation.
Redwood hailed the installation as a breakthrough in the sleepy field of second-life batteries, which has been around for a while but failed to move beyond initial proofs of concept to repeated, large-scale deployments. The firm has indeed broken a record for that stunted sector, certainly in the U.S. and likely the world, delivering 63 megawatt-hours of second-life grid storage in its own backyard. That’s a very deep reservoir of storage for the diminutive onsite data center, which has just 1 megawatt of computing load. The goal is to guarantee 24/7 clean power even with days of inclement weather.
Given the initial success, Straubel sees the energy storage business as a key growth area for Redwood, which was founded in 2017 to recycle battery materials into the domestic supply chain.
“This is, in a way, a first of its kind, and to be able to have a profitable project as a first one is pretty cool,” Straubel said prior to a sunset celebration of the project, held on the desert outcropping above it. “You will absolutely see much larger deployments of this in well under a year, and we are actively engineering and working on those projects today.”
Assuming the concept scales up further, it could be a game changer for data centers that prize speedy new energy construction. But it could further reshape the clean energy transition. Dozens of startups have toiled for years to invent new batteries for long-duration storage. Redwood has already beaten them to a large-scale deployment, without inventing anything new and risky — all it took was some clever reimagining of what others viewed as waste.
## **A radical new approach to second-life battery design**
Using old EV batteries to store energy for the grid makes intuitive sense. Diminished battery capacity is a bigger deal for a vehicle than it is for grid storage; stationary stuff doesn’t need to work as hard as EV batteries, and it can take up a lot more space. A battery with just 80% of its original capacity left may get plucked from a vehicle, but it can still function fine for storing solar power. In theory, these secondhand batteries should be cheaper than new ones, reducing the cost of much-needed grid storage to accompany the rise of renewables.
Yet few second-life grid storage installations exist.
Most of the people who have actually installed second-life batteries have approached it as a small-scale research project, typically grant-funded. A scrappy company called Storage Solutions broke that mold in 2020, when it [built an array of old packs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/used-ev-batteries-are-storing-solar-power-at-grid-scale-and-making-money-at-it) to deliver solar power into California’s energy markets in the most lucrative evening hours. I verified that with my own eyes in 2021, since it went far beyond the sector’s accomplishments at the time. has since expanded the capacity to 28 megawatt-hours, but I haven’t seen a repeat project at that scale yet (though the company did build a 12-MWh project elsewhere in California).
Another startup called Element Energy obtained a bounty of lightly used packs, quite possibly through their investor LG, which endured a billion-dollar recall for units it supplied to General Motors a few years back. Element installed a couple dozen containers in West Texas last year, filled with [53 megawatt-hours of second-life storage](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/long-duration-energy-storage/the-biggest-grid-storage-project-using-old-batteries-is-online-in-texas). Next, it plans to build a factory to mass-produce enclosures for second-life installations.
Now, Redwood has entered the scene with its sprawling Nevada installation.
All of these developers have had to grapple with the same initial challenges. They need to get their hands on old EV packs and then sort out the ones that aren’t going to catch fire. Then they have to figure out how to safely control a patchwork fleet of batteries cobbled together from several manufacturers.
Redwood immediately stands out for its ability to handily source old packs. The company is, officially, a battery recycler, and it says it receives more old batteries than any of its U.S. competitors. All week long, trucks drop off pallets of everything from toothbrush batteries to electric-truck packs, which workers sort and stash in a 32-acre open-air depot. (Redwood says the safety benefits of super-dry air outweigh any risks associated with the bludgeoning Nevada sunshine.)
“If you ever used a lithium-ion battery, it’s probably going to end up coming through here in one way, shape, or form,” Straubel said. EV packs have been shooting up as a portion of total intake, from less than 1 gigawatt-hour per year in 2023 to more than 5 now, he added.
“That’s really one of the keys, is having the scale and having the access to the partnerships and the ability to move and transact and just physically harness that much material,” Straubel said.
Another differentiator might as well be called moxie. Founder Straubel sets the tone as a clean-energy nerd who just likes to give things a shot. He tried second-life microgrids at home before making it a focus for the workplace. His engineers hacked together a universal controller box that connects to each type of EV pack and operates it according to its unique needs. When the time came to test the concept, Straubel oversaw construction of the biggest second-life storage project in the world, all in five months from clearing ground to completion. No grant applications required.

Lastly, the Redwood approach bucks conventional opinion in ways that save time and money.
The storage industry, as a rule, puts its batteries in big metal boxes. Redwood engineers saw that as unnecessary, given how painstakingly ruggedized the packs had to be for vehicular use. No big boxes means no pouring concrete pads. The approach saves on labor, time, and materials.
“There’s almost no poured concrete, frankly — it’s a very light touch on the ground,” Straubel said. “You can pick up and move everything. You can deploy it very fast. Solar was the same way. We actually used this type of architecture specifically because we could deploy it very fast.”
On the solar side, Redwood went with a company that shares the “just throw it on the ground” mentality: [Erthos](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/a-first-hand-look-at-a-california-solar-farm-with-earth-mounted-panels), a scrappy new alternative to the highly engineered trackers that eke every last electron out of the day’s solar arc. This flat-on-the-ground installation also allows a handful of cleaning robots to circumnavigate the array daily and wipe the dust away; their little headlights peeked through the night as Redwood’s celebration cast laser lights across the battery field.
## **AI market heats up while battery recyclers struggle**
Redwood launched Redwood Energy, its business line for second-life storage, at a precarious time for the battery recycling industry, which has promised to recover nearly all the useful materials from old EV batteries.
Redwood succeeded in [raising nearly $2 billion](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/recycling-renewables/redwood-materials-lands-1b-to-boost-its-battery-recycling-efforts) in equity investment since its founding in 2017. It seems to have plenty of resources for the time being. But a leading competitor, Li-Cycle, [declared bankruptcy](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/recycling-renewables/li-cycles-quest-to-recycle-lithium-ion-batteries-ends-in-bankruptcy) this year after failing to raise the money to complete its recycling facility in upstate New York. Another top contender, Ascend Elements, has [pushed back its timeline](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/recycling-renewables/ev-battery-recycling-had-a-rough-2024) for a facility in Kentucky, citing delays from its anchor customer.
The actual task of economically recovering the most valuable battery materials appears to have proven harder in practice than it looked in the pitch decks. Setting aside the technical challenges, there are serious business obstacles. Many key battery commodities have fallen steeply from high prices a few years back, undercutting the value of the recycled products. And there isn’t yet a critical mass of cathode makers to sell to in the U.S., so any recovered materials are just going to generic metals markets for now.
“In a way, we started Redwood almost too early,” Straubel admitted. He was talking about how used EV packs were hard to come by a few years ago. But Redwood and the other recyclers are also now too early for the domestic EV-battery-materials market they would like to sell into.
While that market for recycled materials develops, Redwood can pull in “almost an order of magnitude” more value from its batteries by deploying them for energy storage needs.
“Every battery that we can possibly redeploy, even for as short as a few months, we see a compelling financial case to do that,” Straubel said. In fact, he noted, “This definitely has the potential to grow faster and even to contribute more revenue than the core recycling business.”
That’s somewhat jarring to hear from the battery recycling startup with the most money behind it. The investors funded a battery materials business, not a second-hand battery purveyor. But Straubel stressed that he sees the energy business as additive, not competitive with the original business.
“We’re not getting rid of that material — we’re actually keeping ownership of it,” he said. “We’re keeping the rights to recycle it, and we’re excited to recycle it when it’s done doing its second life in energy storage.”
Redwood Energy is talking with AI customers around the country, but it’s also well-positioned in a desert valley east of Reno that has become something of an industrial and telecom hub. A particularly energetic trick-or-treater could leave Redwood’s campus and knock on the doors of Google, Apple, and Switch, the owner of a fortress-like data center. 
“Those would be logical targets,” Straubel allowed.

B2U Storage Solutions workers break ground on the first of several planned projects in Texas in July 2025. (B2U Storage Solutions)
Five years ago, EV batteries [could hook up to the grid](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/used-ev-batteries-are-storing-solar-power-at-grid-scale-and-making-money-at-it) to store clean energy, safely and cheaply. Now the company is taking the concept to Texas.
just broke ground on a second-life grid battery project in Bexar County, near San Antonio, the company told Canary Media. In the next 12 months, will complete four projects in the region, totalling 100 megawatt-hours of storage, CEO Freeman Hall said. The move marks a major expansion for the scrappy innovator, at a time of increased interest in the value of used EV batteries.
On paper, it makes perfect sense: Putting old EV batteries to work on the grid tackles the waste stream created by [the growing adoption of EVs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/ev-sales-tesla-big-beautiful-bill) while expanding clean energy storage at a discount compared to brand-new lithium-ion batteries. But delivering on the concept efficiently and safely is much harder in practice, and after years of trying, the industry has only installed a handful of utility-scale grid batteries.
stores up to 28 MWh at its first project, in Lancaster, California, and also developed two other smaller facilities in that state. Another company, Element Energy, built a record [53-MWh second-life storage plant](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/long-duration-energy-storage/the-biggest-grid-storage-project-using-old-batteries-is-online-in-texas) in Texas last year. Earlier this summer, lithium-ion recycling startup Redwood Materials beat that record: It unveiled a second-life battery business that includes a [63-MWh storage plant](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/redwood-used-batteries-data-center) to serve an on-site data center in the Nevada desert.
’s new portfolio won’t set any individual records, but it could prove out the repeatability of the second-life model. In developing for the Texas market, focused on areas near population centers that face transmission constraints. It designed the projects as 10-MW systems with a little over two hours of discharge at full capacity, allowing them to qualify for a fast-track permitting program in the grid managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT.
Once built, the batteries can arbitrage from cheap hours when the state’s massive solar fleet is cranking to peak-demand hours when electricity prices shoot up. Batteries, with their ability to instantly inject or absorb power, can also compete to provide various other forms of grid-stabilizing services in the ERCOT markets.
“Texas has been a very strong market with ever more volatility,” Hall said. “And that’s what storage does well, is take advantage of volatile conditions.”
The expansion draws on the company’s five-year track record of operating second-life batteries on the grid, and making money at it.
One lingering question for the sector has been how long the previously worn-down packs would survive when used for daily charging and discharging. The Lancaster project was designed to eke out 2,000 cycles from its initial batch of early Nissan Leaf batteries, Hall said; those packs have now exceeded that target.
Crucially, the equipment has not required much upkeep: Of the 2,000 battery packs that operates so far, technicians have only had to pull out a single-digit number of them for maintenance, Hall noted. That has given the company confidence to dispatch the batteries a bit more intensely.
“We’ve got all these guardrails and real-time monitoring of the batteries that ensure safety, but we’re not as concerned about degrading the batteries,” Hall said. “They’re turning out to be pretty strong workhorses that don’t degrade as people thought they might.”
said its first project, built in 2020, cost about $200 per kilowatt-hour, which at the time offered a roughly one-third discount compared to new battery systems. Today, new lithium-ion enclosures have come down to $150 to $180 per kilowatt-hour, Hall said, and can deliver at half that rate based on the savings from used batteries. Accounting for additional costs associated with permitting, interconnection, and installation, a finished project comes in 30% to 40% cheaper than a new lithium-ion facility would, he added.

has gotten this far with just $20 million raised in an extended Series A funding round, and another $8 million from the founders and friends. Hall built his California projects on the company’s balance sheet to prove out the concept, which was quite risky for most investors at the time. Consequently, has reaped all the profits from those early investments.
Now, though, has far less cash to throw at its projects than newly minted second-life competitor Redwood Materials. That company was founded by former Tesla Chief Technology Officer JB Straubel, a certified celebrity of the battery engineering world who swiftly [raised $2 billion](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/recycling-renewables/redwood-materials-lands-1b-to-boost-its-battery-recycling-efforts) to tackle battery recycling. But Hall found Redwood’s arrival onto the scene more encouraging than intimidating.
“For the North American recycler that has raised the most capital and has been hyping the recycling opportunity the most to now make a big splash and say that they believe that the repurposing market can grow faster and [generate more revenue](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/redwood-used-batteries-data-center) than their core business — that’s quite the validation point,” Hall said.
Going forward, has raised a fund to own its operating projects with a mix of outside equity, debt, and tax equity. That means Hall can sell off the projects to the fund (although will keep a stake in them), freeing up money for new business activities. This sets the company up for faster growth than if it continued to support all its projects with its own corporate balance sheet.
Still, maintains a rare distinction in the cleantech-startup universe: For relatively minor funds raised, the company has built real things that generate profits. Cleantech venture capitalists have heaped far more cash on pre-revenue companies chasing far more dubious propositions.
Five years ago was like “the first at-bat of the first inning” for second-life storage, Hall said, meaning he had a lot to prove in the field to dispel investor concerns about the novel technology. He took it slow on fundraising while he tackled those proof points.
“We’ve been very disciplined in deploying capital. That tends to be viewed by investors as a good thing, but the opportunity is such a big one right now that we need to do what’s smart for shareholders — and staying small probably no longer is as smart,” he reflected. “It’s probably time for us to grow, to take advantage of the opportunity in front of us.”","Energy storage, Batteries",b2u-used-grid-batteries-texas-expansion.md,articles_energy-storage

https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/trump-reopen-nevi-funding,Trump admin reopens $ EV charging program after losses in court,13 August 2025,Jeff St. John,"The Transportation Department says states can reapply for funding under the Biden-era program it had halted. Groups fighting the freeze in court decry the delay.

The Trump administration appears to be backing away from its fiercely contested efforts to freeze a $5 billion federal funding program for electric vehicle chargers.
On Monday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy 5 billion in formula grants from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. NEVI was [created by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/biden-admin-has-7-5b-to-spend-on-ev-charging-how-can-it-get-it-right) to establish reliable charging along major highways, particularly in underserved parts of the country.
“Our revised NEVI guidance slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure,” Duffy said in a statement. “While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.”
Groups representing industries involved in EV charger deployments welcomed the decision, which could allow states to restart projects that have in some cases been paused for months due to orders from the federal government. But environmental advocates warned that the move is just another delay tactic from an administration that’s exceeding its lawful authority by blocking money appropriated by Congress, for EV charging and beyond.
Monday’s announcement comes after months of legal challenges to the Department of Transportation’s February decision [rescinding guidance](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/trump-moves-to-halt-5b-ev-charging-program) for states to access their NEVI funding. That withdrawal, part of [the Trump administration’s broader attack](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/trump-wants-to-end-the-7-5b-bipartisan-ev-charger-buildout-can-he) on Biden-era climate and clean energy initiatives, forced states to halt work underway on contracts and projects representing roughly half of the $5 billion in program funding.
Litigation hasn’t panned out in the administration’s favor so far. In June, a 
Some of those states have been able to access NEVI funding since then, said Daniel Wilkins, a policy analyst at research firm Atlas Public Policy.
However, a chunk of the funding remains unavailable, and the District of Columbia and 20 states are continuing their fight in court in the hopes of getting the Trump administration to unfreeze the rest. The federal government’s actions have disrupted ongoing contracts with EV charging developers and caused “costly delays in project implementation,” according to an 
The 20 states suing the Transportation Department are led by Democratic governors, but the NEVI program sets aside money for red and blue states alike. Texas is set to receive nearly $408 million, 
Under Monday’s order, states can now reapply for funding within the next 30 days.
Getting the NEVI program back up and running will “help to ensure that EV drivers can find charging when and where they need it,” Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, a trade group that includes automakers, battery manufacturers, mining companies, charging manufacturers, and electric utilities, said in a Monday statement. In that light, the new guidance “provides important regulatory certainty for the companies and state departments of transportation that are implementing this program on the ground.”
But the Sierra Club, one of seven nonprofit groups that have NEVI funding freeze, noted that the department’s guidance does not reinstate those plans, but instead requires states to resubmit them, “further delaying the nationwide EV charging buildout.”
“While the Trump administration has moved away from anti-EV rhetoric in this guidance in response to federal litigation filed by over a dozen states, Sierra Club, and other nonprofit organizations, it is still illegally withholding billions Congress dedicated to EV charging,” Katherine García, director of Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All campaign, said in a Monday statement. “We will continue to work towards the recovery of nationwide NEVI funding.”
A spokesperson for the Washington state attorney general’s office, one of the lead plaintiffs in the lawsuit by the 20 states and D.C., said the office is reviewing the revised guidance.
Monday’s announcement also weakens the program’s support for lower-income and disadvantaged communities. It removes requirements that the funding “ensure that the deployment, installation, operation, and use of EV charging infrastructure achieves equitable and fair distribution of benefits and services,” and eliminates Biden-era 40% of the benefits of the projects be targeted toward disadvantaged communities.
Duffy justified these changes in Monday’s statement. “If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” he said.
The NEVI program has made slow progress. The Biden administration hoped to spur the buildout of 206,000 today. But just 378 NEVI fast chargers have come online as of this month, according to Wilkins at Atlas Public Policy. And of the $5 billion in funds, only about $615 million was under contract for constructing almost 1,000 charging sites as of February, according to EV-charging data firm Paren.
Monday’s announcement highlighted that slow start as a “clear signal of the program’s failure.” Both Republicans and Democrats have 
The “marks a constructive step toward addressing the ongoing challenges associated with deploying EV charging infrastructure while also ensuring that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and effectively.”
But Sierra Club’s García said the Trump administration’s freeze has only further delayed the work that Monday’s order purports to streamline. “It’s ironic that this guidance was sold as cutting red tape, yet all it has accomplished is more than half a year of needless delay,“ she said.
The country doubled its [number of public charging ports](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/public-ports-available-us) between 2020 and last year, and 23 NEVI chargers have opened since February.
That delay is particularly harmful to parts of the country that lack the EV adoption to make charger investments worthwhile for private-sector developers — a hurdle NEVI was meant to help overcome. Rural communities in particular are [lagging in fast-charger deployments](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/map-rural-fast-chargers-trump).
Loren McDonald, Paren’s chief analyst, noted that Monday’s revised guidance does give individual states more flexibility and control over how they spend NEVI dollars, which could speed project selection and construction.
However, it could also make the program less effective at serving “[charging deserts](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/3-ways-to-help-ev-charging-bloom-in-charging-deserts),” he said — a term for places where EV charging companies like Tesla, EVgo, and Electrify America were “not deploying stations because utilization would be low.”

Despite the Trump administration’s efforts to EV charging data analytics firm Paren.
As of the first quarter of 2025, 45% of rural counties had at least one fast EV charging port installed, compared to 76.5% of metropolitan counties. Right now, the United States has around 60,000 fast charging ports installed, with more than 3,600 new ones coming online across the U.S. since the beginning of the year, Paren 3 chargers, take about 30 minutes to fill a car to a full charge.
A charging station can have anywhere from several to several dozen charging ports. The term “charger” refers to the hardware. While chargers and ports might seem interchangeable, they’re not. It gets tricky because one charger can have the hookups for more than one vehicle. The number of ports, then, is a useful metric for mapping how EV charging infrastructure is built out in any given area.
In rural areas, charging ports have been slower to come online than in metropolitan areas. That’s partly because of low utilization, or the amount of time the ports are plugged in and providing vehicles with electricity. In cities like San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Miami, where a greater share of the cars on the road are EVs, charging ports can have utilization rates as high as 30% or 40% during peak hours, which are typically in the evening. For much of the rest of the country, though, and particularly in less densely populated rural areas, utilization rates tend to be in the teens or lower.
North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana have the lowest statewide utilization rates in the country, according to Loren McDonald, Paren’s chief analyst. Rural counties in those states also have among the fewest number of charging ports.
“There just aren’t a lot of them on the road there locally to have that sort of baseline level of usage of those stations,” said McDonald.
## **The rural charging catch- 22**
Few EV drivers and a limited number of charging stations pose a dilemma for rural areas looking to expand EV charging infrastructure. Beyond ideological and price considerations, drivers may be hesitant to switch to EVs when there are few places to charge them, while at the same time, investors are hesitant to build charging stations because there aren’t many EV drivers on the road. In order for privately funded charging stations to break even on their investment, utilization rates have to hit certain percentages, usually greater than the teens or low twenties.
“The deck is stacked against those rural areas,” McDonald said. “There aren’t the trends and the economic viability to motivate private industry to put them there.”
To mitigate what McDonald calls this “emerging charging divide,” state and federal-level government programs offer competitive funding for developers to build out EV charging infrastructure in rural areas.
However, the Trump administration has made funding at the federal level difficult for states to access. In February, the Trump administration 5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. Several 2021.
On May 22, the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Transportation, which administers the program under the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), NEVI and that the agency must continue to carry out the requirements of the program. The court case brought by states and nonprofits is still pending.
Funding for NEVI is designed to be allocated to states over a five-year period. The FHWA has allocated a NEVI funding to states through fiscal year 2025. States had awarded or obligated 57 NEVI-funded charging stations 15 states.
Of those NEVI-funded charging stations, 19 are in Ohio, where Paren’s chief technology officer, Bill Ferro, said many are in rural areas. This has to do with Ohio’s major interstate highways that run north-south and east-west through rural counties. In November and December 2024, when traffic increased during the holiday season, utilization rates spiked for Ohio’s rural EV chargers. Ferro said the stations are an example of how NEVI projects can be successful in rural areas.
“We would say they were the best use of NEVI funding in that they were outside the major cities, and they were intended to allow that great American road trip to go,” said Ferro.
Another hotspot on the map is in La Paz County, Arizona, where there are 140 ports, more than any other rural county in the country. Like in Ohio, an interstate is responsible for the build-out, Ferro and McDonald said. Interstate 10 connects Los Angeles to Phoenix, and one Tesla Supercharger station right off the highway has 
As of early June, states are still waiting to see how the future of NEVI is resolved, and some have paused the application process for the next cycle of funding. While the program’s freeze has been a blow to rural areas looking to build out their charging infrastructure, McDonald stressed that NEVI is not the only source of money available to communities.
“Almost every charging station in America has some type of incentive, grant, or tax credit,” McDonald said. “NEVI gets all the headlines, but there are lots of other sources of incentive and grant money to offset costs.”
Utility companies and states have “make-ready” EV charging stations. Some programs will cover the cost of getting sites connected with the utility and any construction that’s needed before the ports go in. Other programs offer rebates for the hardware, helping to facilitate the build-out of EV charging stations in places where private investors would otherwise not be interested in installing charging ports.
McDonald sees the government’s role in funding EV chargers as a way to ensure Americans have access to services regardless of where they live. He compared the current build-out of EV infrastructure to the Rural Electrification Act, which provided federal loans for the installation of rural electrical systems in the 1930s. In that era, the government stepped in to ensure communities had access to electric services in places where private investors didn’t see a way to make a profit.
“There are some things that literally require government help, or otherwise it’s never going to happen,” McDonald said.
Across the U.S., EV sales grew in 2024, increasing the share of EVs among all car sales, according to the International Energy Agency’s 2025 and beyond, despite current political and trade headwinds imposed by the Trump administration.","EV charging, Electric vehicles, Transportation",map-rural-fast-chargers-trump.md,articles_ev-charging

The Trump administration appears to be backing away from its fiercely contested efforts to freeze a $5 billion federal funding program for electric vehicle chargers.
On Monday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy 5 billion in formula grants from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. NEVI was [created by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/biden-admin-has-7-5b-to-spend-on-ev-charging-how-can-it-get-it-right) to establish reliable charging along major highways, particularly in underserved parts of the country.
“Our revised NEVI guidance slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure,” Duffy said in a statement. “While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.”
Groups representing industries involved in EV charger deployments welcomed the decision, which could allow states to restart projects that have in some cases been paused for months due to orders from the federal government. But environmental advocates warned that the move is just another delay tactic from an administration that’s exceeding its lawful authority by blocking money appropriated by Congress, for EV charging and beyond.
Monday’s announcement comes after months of legal challenges to the Department of Transportation’s February decision [rescinding guidance](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/trump-moves-to-halt-5b-ev-charging-program) for states to access their NEVI funding. That withdrawal, part of [the Trump administration’s broader attack](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/trump-wants-to-end-the-7-5b-bipartisan-ev-charger-buildout-can-he) on Biden-era climate and clean energy initiatives, forced states to halt work underway on contracts and projects representing roughly half of the $5 billion in program funding.
Litigation hasn’t panned out in the administration’s favor so far. In June, a 
Some of those states have been able to access NEVI funding since then, said Daniel Wilkins, a policy analyst at research firm Atlas Public Policy.
However, a chunk of the funding remains unavailable, and the District of Columbia and 20 states are continuing their fight in court in the hopes of getting the Trump administration to unfreeze the rest. The federal government’s actions have disrupted ongoing contracts with EV charging developers and caused “costly delays in project implementation,” according to an 
The 20 states suing the Transportation Department are led by Democratic governors, but the NEVI program sets aside money for red and blue states alike. Texas is set to receive nearly $408 million, 
Under Monday’s order, states can now reapply for funding within the next 30 days.
Getting the NEVI program back up and running will “help to ensure that EV drivers can find charging when and where they need it,” Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, a trade group that includes automakers, battery manufacturers, mining companies, charging manufacturers, and electric utilities, said in a Monday statement. In that light, the new guidance “provides important regulatory certainty for the companies and state departments of transportation that are implementing this program on the ground.”
But the Sierra Club, one of seven nonprofit groups that have NEVI funding freeze, noted that the department’s guidance does not reinstate those plans, but instead requires states to resubmit them, “further delaying the nationwide EV charging buildout.”
“While the Trump administration has moved away from anti-EV rhetoric in this guidance in response to federal litigation filed by over a dozen states, Sierra Club, and other nonprofit organizations, it is still illegally withholding billions Congress dedicated to EV charging,” Katherine García, director of Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All campaign, said in a Monday statement. “We will continue to work towards the recovery of nationwide NEVI funding.”
A spokesperson for the Washington state attorney general’s office, one of the lead plaintiffs in the lawsuit by the 20 states and D.C., said the office is reviewing the revised guidance.
Monday’s announcement also weakens the program’s support for lower-income and disadvantaged communities. It removes requirements that the funding “ensure that the deployment, installation, operation, and use of EV charging infrastructure achieves equitable and fair distribution of benefits and services,” and eliminates Biden-era 40% of the benefits of the projects be targeted toward disadvantaged communities.
Duffy justified these changes in Monday’s statement. “If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” he said.
The NEVI program has made slow progress. The Biden administration hoped to spur the buildout of 206,000 today. But just 378 NEVI fast chargers have come online as of this month, according to Wilkins at Atlas Public Policy. And of the $5 billion in funds, only about $615 million was under contract for constructing almost 1,000 charging sites as of February, according to EV-charging data firm Paren.
Monday’s announcement highlighted that slow start as a “clear signal of the program’s failure.” Both Republicans and Democrats have 
The “marks a constructive step toward addressing the ongoing challenges associated with deploying EV charging infrastructure while also ensuring that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and effectively.”
But Sierra Club’s García said the Trump administration’s freeze has only further delayed the work that Monday’s order purports to streamline. “It’s ironic that this guidance was sold as cutting red tape, yet all it has accomplished is more than half a year of needless delay,“ she said.
The country doubled its [number of public charging ports](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/public-ports-available-us) between 2020 and last year, and 23 NEVI chargers have opened since February.
That delay is particularly harmful to parts of the country that lack the EV adoption to make charger investments worthwhile for private-sector developers — a hurdle NEVI was meant to help overcome. Rural communities in particular are [lagging in fast-charger deployments](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/map-rural-fast-chargers-trump).
Loren McDonald, Paren’s chief analyst, noted that Monday’s revised guidance does give individual states more flexibility and control over how they spend NEVI dollars, which could speed project selection and construction.
However, it could also make the program less effective at serving “[charging deserts](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/3-ways-to-help-ev-charging-bloom-in-charging-deserts),” he said — a term for places where EV charging companies like Tesla, EVgo, and Electrify America were “not deploying stations because utilization would be low.”

https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/revel-pge-flexible-connection,How Revel is fast-tracking new EV chargers through a deal with PGE,1 April 2025,Jeff St. John,"The startup is getting charging hubs hooked up to congested urban grids faster in California by participating in the utility’s new “flexible connection” process. 
Revel opened its first West Coast public high-speed EV charging site in San Francisco's Mission District in March 2025. The New York City–based EV charging and rideshare startup is working with utility Pacific Gas & Electric on two other Bay Area sites that will use “flexible connection” technology to ease their stress on the power grid. (Revel)
Want to know why EV chargers can be so hard to connect to crowded urban power grids? Just look to San Francisco’s latest public charging station, opened by startup Revel last week.
At first glance, the station, Revel’s first foray outside of its home city of New York, doesn’t seem like it should be that tricky for Northern California utility Pacific Gas Electric to connect. It’s a fairly small parking lot in the city’s Mission District, right next to a major freeway, featuring a fairly standard number of high-speed chargers — 12 — that are available 24/7.
But when all those chargers are used at once, the total demand on the grid adds up to 1.3 megawatts, Neema Yazdi, a strategic analyst on PGE’s clean energy transportation team, said at the ribbon-cutting event last week. That’s equivalent to roughly one-quarter of the power demand of the city’s tallest building, the 1.4-million-square-foot, 61-story Salesforce Tower.
“That’s a big feat for a utility to energize,” he said — “and to do something like that is impossible without the close collaboration of our customers.”
More such challenges and collaborations are on the way. Revel plans to start construction this year on seven more Bay Area sites with a total of 125 fast-charging plugs. It’s an ambitious pace in a state with notoriously [long wait times to bring EV charging hubs online](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/a-big-barrier-to-californias-electric-truck-goals-a-backlogged-power-grid).
One way Revel hopes to achieve this plan is by entering two of its upcoming stations into a new PGE program to fast-track EV charging hubs. On one condition, that is: Station operators have to be willing to reduce the power that chargers can deliver at the times when PGE’s grid can’t handle the maximum draw. PGE and Revel will pursue this [“flexible service connection” approach](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/a-new-way-to-fix-grid-bottlenecks-for-ev-charging-flexible-connection) at one site in the city of Oakland and another near San Francisco International Airport.
Under standard utility practice, customers can’t connect if their maximum power draw threatens to overtax the grid, even if only during a handful of hours per year when grid demand peaks. That’s despite the fact that many EV charging sites are highly unlikely to have enough vehicles charging at once to reach that limit — and that they can theoretically dial back their power use during those critical hours.
Flexible service turns that theoretical capability into an operational reality. The process is straightforward: PGE forecasts its grid needs and, a day ahead of time, sends customers instructions for when they need to curtail power use.
Both customers and utility win out, Yazdi said. Customers can “connect quickly and more seamlessly” and charge at full capacity most of the time, as they wait for PGE to complete grid upgrades that will eventually remove the constraints they face during peak hours.
PGE, meanwhile, gets to expand EV charging more quickly than it would otherwise be able to. That’s not just good for meeting the state’s carbon-cutting goals but for reducing rates for customers at large. That’s because the program helps reduce immediate pressure on PGE to make grid upgrades, which are a primary driver of rising electricity rates in its territory, while also quickly expanding its electricity sales.
“Only a few utilities in the United States are doing this nowadays,” Yazdi said. “This is really forward-thinking, and we’re really excited about it.”
So are the authors of a PGE’s leading position among U.S. utilities on the flexible connection front. Southern California Edison is pursuing a similar pilot project, the report notes, and utilities and regulators in Illinois and Colorado are exploring approaches to flexible interconnection as well.
Finding ways for EV charging stations to connect more rapidly provides “both economic benefits to the fleet that can put its newly acquired vehicles and chargers to work, and societal benefits where these electric trucks and buses are displacing fossil fuel vehicles earlier than otherwise possible,” the report’s authors wrote. 
## **How flexible connection can help the grid and EV charging**
It took PGE more than a year to establish, test, and gain confidence in the underlying technology needed to complete its first flexible interconnection at a Tesla charging complex in California’s Central Valley late last year.
With initial projects proving the technology is reliable, PGE started looking to expand its use of flexible connections, including at several more EV charging sites in the Central Valley — and Revel’s two sites in the Bay Area.
Revel has been working with PGE for about 18 months to identify sites and plan for its flexible connection projects, said Jake Potent, the company’s vice president of corporate affairs. “There are a lot of times we don’t go forward because we’re grid-constrained.”
In New York City, Revel has already built [told Canary Media back in 2021](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/new-york-city-needs-a-lot-of-ev-chargers-how-can-its-power-grid-support-them-all).
At last week’s ribbon-cutting, Suhey emphasized that building urban fast-charging stations is “kind of hard — well, it’s really hard. It doesn’t happen overnight.”
But finding ways to fit megawatt-scale charging into cities is important for localities in states like New York and California, which have set aggressive goals to end sales of new gasoline-fueled cars by 2035. EVs now make up about one-third of passenger vehicle sales in San Francisco, Mayor Daniel Lurie said at last week’s event, well [above the national share](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/chart-ev-sales-grew-slowly-in-2024-but-still-set-new-records) of around 8%.
Those adoption numbers gave Revel confidence its fast chargers would get enough use to earn back its costs, Suhey told Canary Media. In New York City, where EV adoption is lower, Revel also operates an all-EV rideshare fleet rather than relying solely on public customers to make the economics of its charging sites work out. New York City and California have mandates for rideshare companies to switch to EVs over the coming years, which further [heightens the need for charging sites](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/3-ways-to-help-ev-charging-bloom-in-charging-deserts).
Cities also struggle to bring public charging stations into neighborhoods where most people rent their homes, said Joe Piasecki, public affairs and policy coordinator for the San Francisco Environment Department.
That’s a big problem: Most people charge their EVs at home, but renters [face an uphill battle in convincing landlords](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/renters-need-ev-charging-at-home-these-companies-aim-to-provide-it) to install EV chargers on their behalf. That means renters tend to be disproportionately reliant on public EV charging while also having worse access to it. About 70% of San Francisco residents live in multifamily housing, Piasecki said.
The economics of urban EV charging have been helped along in “make-ready” infrastructure — digging trenches, installing transformers and switchgear, and other work required to connect charging stations to the grid — that the site developer might otherwise bear. Similar programs support EV charger installations in [Illinois](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/illinois-largest-utility-unveils-100m-to-spur-ev-adoption), 
But make-ready work is just one of the expenses that EV charging creates. Sometimes, big sites might force utilities to upgrade the substations serving entire neighborhoods. Flexible interconnection can allow utilities to postpone those “upstream” upgrades until they can be conducted as part of a broader strategic grid expansion plan.
Demand for those upgrades will increase as high-speed charging expands — and as the latest generation of chargers requires even more power to charge vehicles faster. Electrify America’s flagship indoor charging station in San Francisco, which houses 20 high-speed chargers, required 
Public fast chargers aren’t the only option, of course. Slower Level 2 chargers can be installed in garages, along curbs, or [into street lights](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/can-streetlights-unlock-big-city-ev-charging-this-startup-thinks-so). Even slower [Level 1 chargers could offer overnight charging](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/access-to-slow-ev-chargers-could-speed-up-ev-adoption-among-renters) options for multifamily buildings.
But fast chargers that replicate the experience of fueling up at a gas station are widely seen as a vital amenity to expand the pool of people willing to switch to an EV. “Without widespread, easy to use, convenient, reliable fast charging, dreams of EV adoption are just that — dreams,” Suhey said.","EV charging, Electric vehicles, Utilities, West, California",revel-pge-flexible-connection.md,articles_ev-charging
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/middleburg-virginia-fast-charger-tourism,Cruising Virginia countryside in an electric vehicle is a lot easier now,19 August 2025,Elizabeth Ouzts,"As EV tourism takes hold in rural towns, historic Middleburg looks to attract eco-minded visitors with a high-speed electric-vehicle charger. 
Lynne Kaye, sustainability committee chair for Middleburg, Virginia, with the EV fast charger that the town installed last year (Town of Middleburg)
It’s no Route 66.
But the roughly 80-mile stretch of U.S. Route 50 that snakes across Virginia from the nation’s capital to the West Virginia border is rich in American history and culture. The mostly two-lane, winding mountain road features vineyards, battlefields, high-end resorts, and more. And just like the iconic route from Chicago to California, U.S. 50 is increasingly making way for the future of American road trips: electric vehicles.
The tiny town of Middleburg, Virginia, is a case in point: Officials there installed a fast charger nearly 18 months ago to serve EV drivers in the wealthy, bucolic region just 45 miles west of Washington, D.C.
Named for its equidistance between Alexandria and Winchester, Middleburg has long been at the center of foxhunting and steeplechases. These days, the town of less than 1,000 people is also surrounded by wineries and boasts a 
“Since colonial times it has been a stopping place, and it’s continued to be a place where people come from all over the world, as well as from the greater D.C. area,” said Lynne Kaye, chair of Middleburg’s sustainability committee.
As electric vehicles have become more prevalent, so too has “EV tourism”: towns off the beaten path seeking to [lure travelers with charging infrastructure](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/north-carolina-hopes-to-lure-ev-tourists-with-rural-charging-stations). While visitors juice up — often for free at relatively slow Level 2 chargers – they might browse local art galleries and shops, grab some dinner, or visit another attraction they may have otherwise missed.
But Middleburg is part of Loudoun County, 
“When we walked around town, we were noticing a bunch of EVs,” said Kaye. “We wanted to make sure that we didn’t accidentally become unappealing to people who were driving them.”
Reducing the town’s climate footprint was also a consideration. Kaye and others reason that cars driven by visitors and residents are the leading contributor to its planet-warming emissions.
“We only have 673 residents. We can only create so much carbon,” she said. “But when you have 20,000 people come to an event, that’s a lot of carbon all at once.”
When town leaders were in the planning stages of adding their charger, they also noticed a lack of devices in the region that could fill up a car battery in an hour or less. “Not everybody wants to spend however many hours getting their EV charged,” Kaye said.
For all these reasons, the decision to install a fast charger in the heart of town was an easy one. But bringing that choice to fruition wasn’t as simple.
An expansive bay with 10 or more chargers, an increasingly common feature at gas stations, wasn’t logistically feasible in the tiny Town Hall parking lot. And most charging companies Middleburg approached wanted to install no fewer than six fast chargers.
“Getting this huge bank of chargers didn’t fit a historic town,” Kaye said. “There wasn’t really space for it, and we weren’t sure that we were going to get enough traffic to use the chargers effectively.”
XCharge North America came to the rescue. The charger manufacturer was “willing to work with us and come up with a way to have the one charger,” Kaye said. “And it’s been a success.”
Initially called Current Electric, the startup had recently been acquired by a European equipment maker. Its business proposition: 208-volt system rather than the global standard of 480V.
While Middleburg had already wired its new Town Hall to accommodate the industry standard, XCharge still leapt at the opportunity to showcase its hardware, said company cofounder Alex Urist.
“This was very much a way for us to get early applications in the U.S.,” said Urist, who lives in New York City. “The proximity to D.C. is great as well. Selfishly, I go to D.C. to visit the in-laws frequently enough, so I can always check in on the charger. I like to take them over there and show off that I actually have a job,” he quipped.
Typical direct-current fast-charging units can run between $30,000 and $120,000. In Middleburg’s case, XCharge provided its hardware for free while the town covered the installation. The two entities share the revenue from charging sessions, and the company can learn from how the fast charger performs as it explores other markets.
“It’s not really a charger on a high-throughput area,” Urist said. “But what is interesting about it is, it’s kind of dead in the middle of Virginia wine country. It’s along this rural corridor where the perceptive availability of chargers is very important.”
Between March 2024, when the charger was installed, and February 2025, 181 sessions were logged. Since then, there’s been an uptake, with 268 sessions logged as of May 2025, according to XCharge.
“It’s a really interesting use case for us to see. How does it help with the local economy? Are they going to also see any ancillary impacts of it beyond just the revenue coming in?” Urist said.
Indeed, that’s one of the expectations behind an initiative called Virginia Green Travel, which helps the state’s towns, especially those with carbon-reduction goals, attract environmentally minded tourists, said Alleyn Harned, executive director of Virginia Clean Cities.
“Electric vehicle chargers have been part of green tourism in Virginia,” said Harned, whose group is among the backers of the Green Travel initiative.
Virginia Clean Cities, a U.S. Department of Energy-funded entity that’s based at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, is what brought Middleburg and XCharge together. The town’s success with its fast charger was a bright spot for the organization after President Donald Trump [stalled the rollout](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/trump-moves-to-halt-5b-ev-charging-program) of $5 billion for charging infrastructure launched under his predecessor.
“This is a positive story in getting something done,” Harned said, “because this stuff really improves our economy.”
As the Trump administration moves toward [releasing National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure funds](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/trump-reopen-nevi-funding?amp%3Butm_medium=email&%3Butm_campaign=canary&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9nwoUtp6cAEf217e8KuZnxcwLFfSzfB0Lp-yNLrjRT0nUDxIZxTSW24GvoxSCZ9Y0sIcLlguyN-kE48msLj9CicflXTZ8oSZp2WnKwkbpU_RngmGI&_hsmi=375730104&utm_source=newsletter) after losses in court, more towns across Virginia may have the chance to follow Middleburg’s lead.

It’s a tough time for electric trucking in the U.S. The Trump administration has cut off funding for heavy-duty vehicle charging and port infrastructure. Republicans in Congress are trying to rescind states’ authority to set clean vehicle mandates. And tariffs are throttling incoming cargoes to U.S. ports, hampering the business of trucking as a whole while likely also driving up the already-high price of battery-powered trucks.
But in Southern California, the transition away from diesel trucks, which emit a disproportionate share of the transportation sector’s planet-warming and health-harming emissions, is moving forward despite federal policy obstacles. Two big all-electric charging depots opened in April to serve clean trucks operating in the region, which is home to the busiest seaport complex in the country and is the epicenter of U.S. electric truck adoption.
The first, located in Rancho Dominguez, 12 miles north of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, is [startup with more than $1 billion](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/terawatt-infrastructure-snags-1b-for-ev-charging-buildout) in capital and that is working with a 7 megawatts of capacity at 20 fast-charging stalls, it can charge up to 125 trucks per day.
The 60 miles east of Los Angeles in California’s Inland Empire, a region crowded with massive distribution warehouses. That site is owned and operated by 12 pull-through sites for trucks hauling trailers, which are equipped with 400-kilowatt dual-port chargers, along with 29 “bobtail” lanes — sites for trucks without attached trailers — equipped with 180-kW chargers. In total, it can support just over 10 megawatts of charging.
These facilities are the latest in a line of big truck-charging depots springing up across California, built by major firms like [logistics operators like Prologis](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/without-enough-utility-power-california-ev-truck-depots-try-microgrids), and startups including [Forum Mobility](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/california-is-getting-its-biggest-electric-truck-charging-station-yet), [Voltera](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/more-money-is-flowing-to-charge-electric-trucks-in-california), and [WattEV](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/big-electric-truck-charging-depots-are-coming-soon-to-california). This proliferation is in response to the state’s ambitious truck electrification goals, which include a target for completely zero-emissions fleets by 2045, and to the the hefty incentives it has put in place to accomplish that.
Terawatt’s and Greenlane’s newly opened electric truck stops represent a new class of charging site meant to serve the next phase in the Southern California electric truck charging evolution.
Early truck-charging sites were designed to serve [shorter-range trucks that deliver goods](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/electric-trucks-could-handle-millions-of-short-haul-routes-across-north-america) from a central warehouse before returning to recharge overnight. But Terawatt’s and Greenlane’s new depots are meant to function more like a classic highway stop for battery-powered trucks looking to deliver [goods hundreds of miles away](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/electric-big-rigs-are-going-farther-and-charging-faster).
The new stations will support more routes per day from Southern California’s crowded ports to its distribution warehouses further inland, said Emilia Sibley, lead of Terawatt’s heavy-duty business unit. Terawatt’s newly opened site, which serves the trucks of customers ranging from relatively small freight haulers like “meant to be an enabler for on-the-go charging,” she said — a place to get a “top-off charge to get from the port to the Inland Empire multiple times per day, rather than once a day.”
This infrastructure will allow truck owners to “extend the range and economics of these heavy-duty assets,” she said. Owners and operators measure the value of trucks not just on up-front price and long-term operating cost, but on the revenue the vehicles generate over their useful life. Being able to run two trips per day instead of one could essentially double a truck’s value.
The same dynamic applies to electric trucks looking for a recharge at the end of delivery routes in the farther reaches of the Inland Empire, said Andrea Pratt, Greenlane’s vice president of government and utility relations. Unlike most truck-charging depots today, Greenlane’s Colton site is open to any electric truck, in the traditional “truck stop–type model,” she said. “We are publicly facing, and we will always have charging available for trucks to come up and charge ad hoc.”
These big new charging depots are also the launchpads for a broader eastward expansion of truck-charging capacity. Greenlane’s Colton site is the first of a string of electric truck stops being planned from Long Beach to the Mojave Desert cities of Barstow and Baker as part of its 
The routes and use cases open to electric trucks will further expand as the next generation of longer-range trucks from mainstream manufacturers and those from all-electric specialists like 2026.
“As battery technology increases and as prices come down, you’re really going to see a change in the market,” Pratt said.
Both Greenlane’s and Terawatt’s new charging depots also offer fancier versions of the typical truck stop amenities, such as a lounge area with food and drink for sale, restrooms, free Wi-Fi, and round-the-clock security and customer support. Those are important both for on-the-go truckers spending a half hour to an hour to top up their batteries for the next leg of their journey and for trucks reserving bobtail spots to recharge overnight.
“Sites like ours can really de-risk the zero-emissions vehicle journey,” Pratt said, particularly for the vast majority of U.S. trucking fleets that “You may be less likely to need to put down a lot of capital to electrify your property if there’s a Greenlane or a Terawatt or a Forum down the street — and there will be someone there if something’s gone wrong.”
## **The risks and rewards of building truck-charging depots**
This build-it-and-they-will-come approach to electric trucking comes with its fair share of financial risk — particularly in the shadow of the second Trump administration.
The administration has frozen or restricted billions of dollars in grant funding authorized by Congress in the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Those actions have left states and companies uncertain about whether they can rely on billions of federal dollars [for building charging infrastructure](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/trump-moves-to-halt-5b-ev-charging-program) on major transit corridors and 
The Trump administration [Advanced Clean Fleets mandate](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/how-quickly-can-trucking-decarbonize-california-is-about-to-find-out), which set statewide zero-emissions truck purchasing quotas on most large truck fleets.
Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress 10 other states to 
Economic troubles are compounding the regulatory uncertainty. President Donald Trump’s crushingly high tariffs imposed on China have led to a major reduction in cargo being shipped to U.S. ports, _any_ new trucks — electric or diesel.
Those tariffs will also [drive up the cost of lithium-ion batteries](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/trump-tariffs-clean-energy-industry), most of which are made in China today. Battery costs are the biggest reason why electric trucks remain 
These headwinds further complicate the inherently uncertain economics of electric truck charging. Companies like Greenlane and Terawatt do have some levers to pull to secure demand for the charging infrastructure they’re building, however.
While Greenlane is opening its Colton chargers to all users, “that doesn’t mean we don’t have customers,” Pratt said. Last week’s ribbon-cutting featured one major anchor customer — 100 electric trucks it plans to bring onto Southern California roads.
Nevoya cofounder and Chief Commercial Officer John Verdon said the startup is working directly with “shipping customers looking to achieve sustainability goals.”
“We hire the drivers, acquire the trucks and trailers, and charge the trucks,” he said. “There are lanes where we are price-competitive with diesel — and in those markets we’re very aggressive.” But other markets are “quite candidly not price-competitive” due to challenges around charger availability and vehicle range and price.
It will take some careful planning to expand charging at the proper pace and scale to match the trucking industry’s demand for electrifying its fleet. “We’re building these things with a lot of intention and strategy behind it,” Pratt said, using such inputs as the telematics data from Daimler trucks to understand where route lengths and freight volumes allow electric trucks to compete, and how much charging is needed at which sites to support that.
“At the end of the day, for fleets, it’s all about dollars and cents and making the economics work,” she said. That puts pressure on states like California that want to keep growing the clean freight sector to keep up support, she said.
California has been a leader on incentives to expand electric trucks, she noted. The state’s 
”These are really small margins that companies are running their trucks on,” Pratt said. “If we want a long-term viable market, we need carrots and sticks — and maybe more carrots than sticks in the beginning.”","EV charging, Clean fleets, Transportation, West, California",truck-depots-greenlane-terawatt.md,articles_ev-charging

The administration, which opposes EVs, is trying to claw back the money. 
_This article originally appeared on_ _, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy, and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter_ _._
Sixteen states, the District of Columbia, and more than a half dozen environmental groups have alleged in a lawsuit that the Trump administration has indefinitely and unlawfully frozen funds for a 
The complaint was filed on Thursday last week in U.S. District Court in Seattle. Plaintiffs’ attorneys are asking the judge to require the Trump administration to unfreeze the funds and distribute them to the states according to a formula established by Congress.
During the Biden administration, Congress appropriated $5 billion for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, also known as NEVI, as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021. The money would have been disbursed each year to all 50 states, plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, to build a nationwide network of electric vehicle charging stations along designated Alternative Fuel Corridors.
“Transportation is the leading source of climate pollution in the U.S., and halting the NEVI program directly threatens our progress toward clean, reliable transportation options — especially in the Southeast, where EV infrastructure is still catching up,” said Megan Kimball, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. “In rural and urban areas alike, more charging access means cleaner air, economic growth, and real savings for families. We’re defending that future.”
The legal challenge coincided with a NEVI program, the GAO wrote, but it can’t act unilaterally.
A department spokesperson said in a prepared statement that the GAO report “shows a complete misunderstanding of the law” and “conflicts with Congress’ intent.”
Less than three weeks after Trump was elected to a second term, the Transportation Department 2022-2025, worth about $2.7 billion. States could reimburse contractors for money already spent, but no new funding could be obligated.
DOT justified the funding freeze by saying the Federal Highway Administration was “updating the NEVI Formula Program Guidance to align with current policy and priorities.”
The GAO report concluded that the Transportation Department erroneously froze funding when it determined that funding was available only for signed project agreements. Instead, the GAO wrote, the effective date for funding was much earlier: when the law made money for the program available for obligation.
Some agencies delay their funding distribution while trying to comply with legal requirements for a program, the GAO wrote. In the NEVI case, however, DOT imposed requirements that exceed what the law prescribes. For example, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act requires states to submit plans to DOT, but does not provide authority for the secretary of transportation to approve or disapprove such plans.
A DOT spokesperson said the GAO was “cherry-picking language in the program statute.”
The agency is updating NEVI program guidance, according to the spokesperson, “because the implementation of NEVI has failed miserably, and DOT will continue to work in good faith to update the program so it can be utilized more efficiently and effectively.”
Attorneys for the environmental groups — including CleanAIRE NC, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, West End Revitalization Project, Sierra Club, and the Natural Resources Defense Council — wrote that in blocking the distribution of funds, the Trump administration directly defied congressional directives.
The funding freeze nullified more than 150 state implementation plans, according to court documents, which harmed local communities. NEVI requires EV charging stations in the first phase to be installed every 50 miles along the federally 
“By reducing access to reliable public charging,” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote, “DOT and the FHWA are restricting electric vehicle owners’ ability to travel and use their EVs, increase their fuel costs, delay EV purchases, worsen health impacts from vehicle pollution, and deprive communities of promised public investment.”
In the Charlotte, North Carolina, metro area, for example, air quality — such as levels of ozone and particulate matter — has worsened, according to the 2025 American Lung Association State of the Air Report. The largest city in North Carolina, Charlotte is ringed and bisected by several highways clogged with cars.
“Tailpipe pollution is a public health crisis — fueling asthma, heart disease, and respiratory illness in communities already overburdened by environmental harm,” Jeff Robbins, executive director of CleanAIRE NC, said in a prepared statement. “NEVI is a vital step toward reducing that harm through zero-emission transportation. Freezing the program blocks progress and keeps our most vulnerable residents breathing dirty air. Clean air and climate justice cannot be put on hold.”
Interstate 85 and U.S. Highway 70 run through many underserved communities in Alamance County, North Carolina, about 30 miles west of Durham.
“For decades, communities like ours in Alamance County have been denied access to basic infrastructure,” said Omega Wilson, codirector of the West End Revitalization Association. “The NEVI program offers a real chance to change that — with public investment in EV charging that finally includes rural Black and brown neighborhoods. Suspending the program delays critical investments, widens infrastructure disparities, and sends the message that once again, the taxpayers who’ve been left behind the longest will be the last to benefit.”","EV charging, Electric vehicles, Policy regulation, Transportation",states-and-advocates-sue-trump-to-unfreeze-billions-in-ev-charging-funds.md,articles_ev-charging
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/3v-infrastructure-multifamily-apartments,Multifamily housing needs EV charging. This startup will pay for it.,17 April 2025,Jeff St. John,"Infrastructure is self-financing EV charging at multifamily properties, betting that the rewards of selling at-home charging at scale are worth the up-front risk. 
Aubrey Gunnels, CEO of EV chargers in thousands of apartment building garages and condominium parking lots. She also sees the opportunity.
Just look at the statistics. By 2030, EVs are expected to make up 80% of EV charging takes place at home, and roughly one-third of Americans 5% of U.S. multifamily housing offers on-site EV charging, according to CBRE, one of the world’s largest property management companies and a 
“People really prefer to charge at home,” Gunnels said — and they’ll want to live in apartments or condos that offer that option. 
Tenants don’t pay to install EV charging, though — property owners do, and they aren’t in the business of financing, installing, or operating complex EV charging projects.
That’s where Infrastructure comes in, Gunnels said. Since launching last year, the New York–based startup has is installing chargers at hundreds of sites in 17 states, and hopes to expand to thousands by 2030, she said.
Getting big is key to ’s business model, Gunnels said. Many [“charging-as-a-service” offerings for multifamily properties](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/renters-need-ev-charging-at-home-these-companies-aim-to-provide-it) already cover the cost of chargers in exchange for monthly fees or other payback structures. But isn’t asking property owners for any money at all, she explained — just a 10-year contract to let it build chargers on the site and charge customers for using them.
That means it’s up to to pick the right properties, install the right number of chargers in the right locations, keep them in good working order, and decide how much it needs to charge users to make its money back.
“We’re taking early risk with the EV driver adoption rate at each site,” Gunnels said. “And once we’re profitable, we share the profits with the property owner — and that helps allow us to maintain the chargers.”
## **A business model for EV chargers to match the market’s evolution**
In that sense, ’s business model more closely resembles that of the public charging operators that rely on electricity sales to earn back their up-front costs. That’s inherently riskier than getting someone to pay you to install and operate EV chargers — and so far it’s a rarity in the world of multifamily EV charging developers.
It is, after all, still early days for the EV charging industry. The [first public charger deployments were boosted](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/ev-chargers-have-a-big-reliability-problem-can-the-government-fix-it) by significant government or utility incentives to make up for the fact that there weren’t enough EVs on the road to reliably finance their costs.
But up-front incentives aren’t a good mechanism to ensure that chargers keep performing over the long haul. In fact, EV chargers have a [long and troubled history of not working](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/whats-behind-the-epidemic-of-unreliable-ev-chargers) when drivers need them to. This is a well-publicized problem with public chargers, but it’s affected multifamily properties as well.
“As we all know, the statistics about EV charger uptime are not great. A lot of those chargers may be not functioning,” said Mark Kerstens, vice president of EV charging solutions at CBRE. That’s certainly true for the earliest rollouts of multifamily charging, many of them undertaken by property owners themselves.
CBRE manages and advises multifamily property owners around the world, and works with a number of chargepoint operators, including , for those looking to install EV charging, Kerstens said. Some property owners have taken on charging installations and operations on their own, he said. But most are simply looking for a way to not be left behind in a market that’s constantly seeking out new amenities to draw in tenants and residents.
How badly property owners feel they need EV chargers depends on where they are and what type of tenant they want to attract, he said. He sees the overall market as shifting to the point where it could be “a negative differentiator, if you’re the only multifamily property that does not have an EV charger.” And for many property owners, “it’s just like a vending machine in the rec room — they don’t want to do it themselves, they’d rather have a service provider.”
CBRE’s EV charging partners run the gamut from all-in risk-takers like to a range of “as-a-service” models that charge monthly fees or arrange cost- and revenue-sharing agreements with property owners, he said. What’s paramount, he said, is that the chargers work properly — and “there’s quite a bad track record for those who’ve tried to do it on their own.”
The same concern applies to charging provided by a third party, said Clark Longhurst, president of commercial markets at on its projects with Bridge Investment Group. SitelogIQ has decades of experience installing LED lighting, building controls, and other energy-efficiency projects in multifamily housing. EV charging is a relatively new addition to that roster — and “there’s a longer list of people who will do it ‘as a service,’” he said.
But EV charging for multifamily properties has had some serious problems. Early projects were plagued by chargers that couldn’t receive wireless control signals in concrete parking garages, low-cost chargers that companies failed to repair promptly when they broke, and other issues, he said.
“I don’t want to hand this over to someone who will provide a bad experience – that’s bad for me as a property owner,” Longhurst said. Any provider of charging as a service “needs to have the same incentives — or maybe more incentives — than you have as an owner to ensure the charging works, that it’s done without friction, and if there’s a problem it’s handled quickly.”
Multifamily property owners also have to consider the risks of taking responsibility for charging infrastructure that could end up being abandoned as companies exit various markets, said Larsen Burack, EV charging product manager at analysis firm Ohm Analytics. His company’s [companies like Enel X Way](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/enel-x-way-abandoned-its-us-ev-charging-customers-what-happens-next) that abruptly exited the market and stopped supporting customers.
“Options like the model are intriguing for property managers because there is no up-front capital cost and can be seen as relatively low risk,” Burack said. At the same time, “this is still a volatile industry, and if a company shutters, you risk having another Enel X situation on your hands.”
## **Scaling up multifamily charging infrastructure**
Gunnels conceded that ’s customers will need to have faith in its ability to execute on its 10-year contracts. She also highlighted that the company doesn’t rely on government subsidies for its projects to be profitable, and takes a conservative approach to forecasting utilization — the critical metric of how often chargers are used, and thus how quickly they can pay back their costs and earn profits.
That’s important for aligning the long-term incentives of the charging business, she believes. “Many of the stranded chargers we have across the nation are not a product of hardware or software [issues] — it’s really the economics,” she said. “If someone’s not incentivized to make sure the chargers work, they’re not going to work.”
’s conservative approach may limit the scope of markets and properties that the company goes after. ”We don’t believe every multifamily building has to have an EV charger in the next five years,” she said, even if most will eventually need them. will also limit how many chargers it installs at each property during its initial deployment phases, as the company tests its utilization forecasts against reality.
The key to success, Gunnels said, is scale and diversity. Each individual project may be relatively small — costing, say, between $30,000 to $100,000 to install up to 14 Level 2 chargers per property.
Luckily for , it’s easier to predict utilization for multifamily properties than roadside and public charging. So said Quinn Pasloske, a managing director of the with up to $40 million going into its first round of investments.
“Historically we’ve been very averse to taking utilization risk. This has been the third rail” for investors in the charging sector, he said. Roadside charging, for instance, runs the risk of too few EVs showing up to pay back its up-front or ongoing costs — or the risk that another charging station will open across the street and steal its business.
“But when there’s charging at home, people charge at home,” he said. “Now, all of a sudden, you have captive demand. Even though you are taking utilization risk, you can measure and modulate that so much more carefully.”
To be clear, that dilution of utilization risk works best at large scales, he said.
“You cannot be doing this on a property-by-property basis,” Pasloske said. “You need scale — it needs to be over $100 million, and to get to really attractive costs of capital, over $500 million. And you need a lot of diversification.”
“But once we have scale, the cost of capital comes down dramatically,” he said. That’s because these kinds of projects can be bundled into portfolios and sold as 
“The market is very good at understanding the risk of distributed assets, even if these assets are high risk,” Pasloske said.
’s eventual success relies on achieving that level of scale, Gunnels said. It’s not there yet: “We are using equity to invest in this, so the cost of capital is high. But we have enough data to show that utilization is dependable,” she said — and “we know we have to be at thousands of properties to make this model work.”

https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/distributed-energy-resources/solid-state-transformers-dgmatrix-resilient-power,"A universal adapter for solar, batteries, EVs, and microgrids is here",18 August 2025,Jeff St. John,"DG Matrix and Resilient Power say their solid-state transformers can cut costs, time, and complexity for powering data centers, EV charging hubs, and more. 
DG Matrix CEO Haroon Inam stands next to his company's new solid-state transformer technology, the multi-port Power Router. (DG Matrix)
For decades, electrical engineers have dreamed of a device that can seamlessly connect solar panels, battery systems, and on-site generators to high-powered equipment like EV chargers or data center servers, without loads of expensive hardware to make it all work together.
Now, these devices, called solid-state transformers, are actually starting to hit the market — and they couldn’t be coming at a more opportune time.
That’s because the technology could be key to dealing with the torrent of power demand from [data centers](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/one-way-data-centers-can-help-the-grid-by-being-flexible), [factories](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/in-a-first-a-solar-microgrid-will-directly-power-an-industrial-plant), and [electric-vehicle charging hubs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/a-new-way-to-fix-grid-bottlenecks-for-ev-charging-flexible-connection) that threatens to overwhelm the grid and cause utilities to burn more planet-warming fossil fuels.
Right now, these large electricity customers are clamoring for more power than the U.S. grid can easily supply. In theory, this problem could be solved by allowing them to install their own solar arrays, batteries, and generators on site — ideally as a [microgrid](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/grid-edge/the-countrys-first-neighborhood-microgrid-is-coming-online-in-chicago) — but that seemingly simple solution is actually complicated and costly to execute.
Every solar array, battery, fuel cell, generator, or other source of on-site power requires multiple pieces of equipment — electrical protection gear, isolation transformers, step-up and step-down transformers, power converters — to safely turn direct current into alternating current or vice versa, and to raise or lower voltages to match the needs of different loads within a building.
Solid-state transformers can do all that from a single device, controlling electricity as nimbly as routers control the flow of data. That’s particularly valuable when it comes to managing equipment with high power needs, like EV chargers, or with extremely sensitive requirements for power quality, like the server racks populating data centers.
So says Haroon Inam, CEO and cofounder of DG Matrix 1,000 units annually, he said.
“We’re hitting the massive underserved commercial and industrial microgrid market,” he said. “People haven’t done it because it costs so damn much to build individual snowflake microgrids.”
DG Matrix is not the only firm working on this. 
Major electronics companies are interested. Electrical equipment giant Eaton last month agreed to [raised $5 million in 2021](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/why-amazon-is-investing-in-a-startup-thats-shrinking-the-footprint-of-ev-charging) to build and deploy its power-conversion devices for EV charging hubs and other energy-hungry settings. Eaton will spend $55 million on the company on closing; additional payments based on Resilient Power’s financial and technological performance in the coming years could total another $95 million.
“People have been working at this technology for well over a decade,” said Aidan Graham, senior vice president and general manager of Eaton’s critical power solutions business. But now, following several key engineering advances, the technology may finally be ready for primetime — and utilities and others are starting to test it out.
## **The evolution of solid-state transformers**
Eaton has been “there are a couple of branches we’re chasing,” Graham said, including EV charging and integrating batteries into data centers and other critical environments, “where people‘s lives are on the line, or a lot of money is on the line, if the power goes out for even a fraction of a second.”
Michael Wood III, DG Matrix’s chief of staff, said the company is testing its devices with companies including electrical-equipment manufacturing giant ABB, North Carolina-based utility Duke Energy, and PowerSecure, a major microgrid and data-center power system developer owned by utility Southern Co.
“The best way to get the next gigawatt of energy is to build distributed systems,” Wood said. “Today, you need all of this gear to make those projects work. DG Matrix eliminates all that balance of systems and boils it down to a single system.”
Using a DG Matrix solid-state transformer can cost half as much as using the standard mix of multiple technologies to connect the components of a typical on-site microgrid, Inam said. It also makes it a lot simpler to quickly mix and match devices or to change up the configuration of systems at data centers, EV charging hubs, and other potential microgrid sites.
So if solid-state transformers are such a useful technology, why are they just now getting into the field?
There are good reasons why it’s taken so long, said Vlatko Vlatkovic, a veteran of General Electric’s industrial electrification business and a partner at DG Matrix investor Clean Energy Ventures, who joined the startup’s board of directors this year.
Much of the power grid relies on electromechanical devices that operate in relatively simple ways that haven’t changed much in a century. Despite recent advances that have enabled things like solar inverters or electric-vehicle drivetrains, the same kind of semiconductors that make modern computing possible have yet to be applied widely to the power grid.
“It’s always been a big challenge to move that industry towards using more power electronics,” Vlatkovic said, particularly at the higher voltages of electricity on the grid. Until relatively recently, the underlying technology “wasn’t big enough, wasn’t reliable enough. There were technical issues.”
Similar challenges have dogged solid-state transformers in higher-voltage industrial applications, said Neal Dikeman, a partner at Resilient Power investor Energy Transition Ventures. Consistent advances in silicon carbide semiconductors have helped, as have strides in the computing ability required to make them effective at power conversion, he said. “But that doesn’t make it easy.”
Inam, who served as chief technology officer at [grid power-controls provider Smart Wires](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/new-projects-aim-to-break-us-barriers-to-digitizing-the-grid) before joining DG Matrix in 2023, noted several key challenges that the startup had to solve to get to this point.
Dissipating the heat created by converting alternating current and direct current at high voltages is tricky, for one. So is dealing with “electromagnetic noise,” or interference caused by that same high-frequency electrical switching. “If you don’t understand how to critically mitigate that noise, it gets into everything. It causes overheating, blow-ups, and misperformance,” Inam said.
Solving those challenges has its rewards, however. “We’re at the point where the technology is mature enough and good enough so that we can introduce reliable devices,” Vlatkovic said. 
## **Why now’s the time for solid-state transformers**
The timing couldn’t be better.
“Everything’s being electrified, from cars to industry to housing,” Vlatkovic said. “If you look at the projections for what the grid needs to deliver over the next 10 to 20 years, at a minimum we have to double the capacity of the grid. Some projections say we need to triple what we have.”
Meeting power demand from data centers is a particularly big opportunity, Inam said.
Tech giants’ AI ambitions are [taxing the grid capacity of utilities](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/utilities-are-flying-blind-on-data-center-demand-thats-a-big-problem) in [data center hot spots](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/data-centers-are-driving-us-power-demand-to-hard-to-reach-heights) like Virginia, Georgia, and Texas. That’s led data center developers to explore ways to reduce the stress they put on grids — including the potential for 
“The three big problems are speed to power — customers can’t get power fast enough — cost of power, and the ability to aggregate multiple resources to reach flexibility,” Inam said. “We talk to enterprise customers with hundreds or thousands of sites. Their biggest challenge is having to design every single one from scratch. They’re looking for a turnkey solution to the challenge of not having to deploy one, but having to deploy 1,000.”
Solid-state transformers can help meet those needs, Vlatkovic said. “You go from complex installations and multiple companies to one company doing everything.”
Packing more capabilities into a smaller “power-dense” package also saves valuable space in tight environments like data centers and EV charging sites, Eaton’s Graham said. And solid-state transformers can be made en masse in factories, reducing the cost and time spent on electrical labor on job sites. “You’ve pulled that back into a controlled manufacturing environment,” Graham said.
Plus, having a single device that can perform multiple tasks simplifies engineering needs, Dikeman said.
“If you’re using off-the-shelf components and designing a complex system, the mismatching of” different devices that don’t perfectly match the needs of the system “drives up costs and drives down efficiency,” he said. “You can get around that by building custom stuff — but that’s more expensive and more risky. When you get to solar and storage and data centers and people who need to go fast and need things that are reliable and cheap, all of that breaks down.”
All of these potential benefits have led PowerSecure, the microgrid developer, to launch pilots of at least two solid-state transformer technologies, including its tests with DG Matrix, said Joaquin Aguerre, the company’s director of strategic portfolio development. “We’re trying to be in front on this technology.”
PowerSecure has designed and installed more than 2.4 gigawatts of microgrid capacity for customers ranging from big-box retailers and hospitals to utilities and data centers. It’s particularly interested in solid-state transformers to integrate power-efficient “hybrid microgrids” that combine “solar, energy storage, natural-gas generators, fuel cells, EV charging, you name it,” Aguerre said.
“There is starting to be a real market need,” he said. At the same time, “the majority of these companies are still in the early stages. … The next logical step is doing proper pilot programs, to see real customer use cases at a smaller scale” and to test the durability and reliability of the technologies in question.
After all, whatever their drawbacks compared to cutting-edge power electronics, traditional transformers “don’t fail that often,” Aguerre pointed out. “Everyone’s going to expect the same reliability for whatever solid-state transformer they’re looking at.”

If you didn’t think President Donald Trump’s attacks on offshore wind could get worse, think again. In just the last week, the administration targeted more already-permitted wind projects, slashed funding for projects tied to offshore wind, and enlisted a wide array of federal departments to go after the industry.
Trump [vowed on the first day of his term](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/scare-tactics-and-uncertainty-what-trumps-offshore-wind-order-means) that “we aren’t going to do the wind thing,” and it’s been blow after blow to the sector since. But in the last two weeks, the Trump administration has doubled down on its commitment to crushing offshore wind in particular — and what was already an aggressive campaign has now become an all-out war.
In late August, the Interior Department [sent a stop-work order](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-admin-halts-construction-of-nearly-finished-offshore-wind-farm) to the Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island, even though the development is just months away from completion. It echoed a similar — [failed](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/equinor-empire-trump-timeline) — attempt to halt construction of the Empire Wind project off the coast of New York back in April.
New England’s grid operator [has since warned](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-revolution-halt-disaster-new-england-grid) that delays will jeopardize power reliability and raise electricity prices, and even fishermen who voted for Trump are urging the administration to [let work resume](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/fishermen-oppose-trump-revolution-halt). Developer Ørsted and the states of Rhode Island and Connecticut [are now suing](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/orsted-states-sue-trump-revolution-halt) the Trump administration to get Revolution Wind construction up and running.
The halt turned out to be just the start of a new wave of attacks. Late last week, the Transportation Department said it would 426 million granted to [turn a California port](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/california-port-trump-grant-cut) into the country’s first hub for floating offshore wind construction.
Recent federal court filings reveal the administration is also looking to revoke and reconsider permits for three already-approved projects: 
And now, Trump is expanding his full-court press by calling on federal departments that typically have nothing to do with offshore wind, 
If it wasn’t clear before, it is now: The Trump administration is going to leave no stone unturned in its attempt to stop offshore wind in America.

**Court OKs green bank termination**
The Trump administration scored a significant, but potentially temporary, win in its efforts to claw back billions of dollars meant to bring clean energy to communities nationwide. A federal appeals court EPA has the authority to cancel awards under the $20 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.
The “green bank” program, created by the Inflation Reduction Act, is supposed to provide low-interest loans for emissions-reducing projects in low-income and disadvantaged communities. The EPA moved early in Trump’s presidency to revoke the funds, which had already been awarded to the nonprofits administering the program, and the money has been frozen in Citibank accounts ever since. Still, it’s not the end of the line: The nonprofits indicate they’ll appeal the decision further.

A massive wind farm will soon resume construction near New York City after the Trump administration lifted a federal block late Monday, bringing an end to a high-stakes, monthslong saga that threatened to tank the project.
Before its stunning reversal, the stop-work order on Empire Wind 1 sent chills through the burgeoning U.S. offshore wind industry. Many feared it marked the death of the installation, which is the nation’s first offshore wind farm to begin at-sea construction since President Donald Trump took office in January. In the weeks leading up to his inauguration, Trump said “no new windmills” would be built in the U.S. during his presidency.
Empire Wind 1 is eight years in the making and when complete will feature 54 turbines capable of producing 810 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 500,000 homes. It will be the first offshore wind project to feed directly into New York City’s power grid. Its onshore terminal in South Brooklyn is halfway finished, and at-sea construction started in early April.
The unprecedented pause on the $5 billion energy infrastructure project — New York state’s “rushed.”
That same day, on April 16, BOEM sent a letter to Equinor, the project’s developer, explaining that the basis of the stop-work order was feedback from NOAA about Empire Wind’s environmental impact and that the branch needed time to “address” the information. “You may not resume activities until BOEM informs you that BOEM has completed its necessary review,” said 
On Monday evening, BOEM sent Equinor “ongoing” but that the construction halt is — officially — lifted.
Equinor, working with New York lawmakers and possibly Norwegian diplomats, seems to have reached a deal yesterday with Trump officials, though the specifics are still coming to light.
In a “willingness to move forward on critical pipeline capacity,” raising alarm among environmental advocates that a potential deal had been reached to build a fossil-gas pipeline in the state in exchange for Empire Wind moving forward.
“New York will work with the Administration and private entities on new energy projects that meet the legal requirements under New York law,” said Hochul in “no deal on any natural gas pipeline was reached.”
Here’s a timeline of the Trump administration’s attempts to stop Empire Wind, which almost derailed a project crucial to the grid reliability and clean-energy goals of New York state.
**Jan. 20:** Trump issues an executive order that initiates a federal review of offshore wind activities during the Biden administration and pauses all new offshore wind permitting and leasing. [Nine projects that already have federal permits in hand](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/scare-tactics-and-uncertainty-what-trumps-offshore-wind-order-means), including Empire Wind, appear safe to proceed.
**Feb. 11: **Anti-offshore wind groups 1.
**Feb. 14:** Trump officials cut eight employees from BOEM’s renewables office, the group that oversees Empire Wind’s construction and operations permits. This kicks off a wave of layoffs and retirements that shrinks the office from 80 to 60 total employees by early May, according to an Interior Department employee granted anonymity for fear of retribution.
**March 24: **An Equinor-run Listserv catering to boat captains and local residents posts a notice that underwater “rock installation” around the sites of Empire Wind’s future turbine bases will begin in April.
**March 26**: U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican and longtime offshore wind opponent, “alarming development” of the project starting at-sea work. He advises Burgum to “block construction” of Empire Wind using “everything in your power.” Smith cites the president’s anti-wind executive order alongside other unsubstantiated claims that Empire Wind could “blind” military radar or break apart during hurricanes.
**April 1: **Empire Wind’s at-sea construction begins. In the first step toward erecting turbines, Equinor lays rock on the seabed that will eventually protect its turbine bases. The developer issues no press releases and holds no public ceremonies.
**April 9: **Canary Media [reports](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/empire-wind-construction-trump) that Empire Wind’s first steel monopile — the subsea part of a wind tower — will be driven into the seafloor on May 1. Undersea cable laying is scheduled for June, according to Canary Media’s sources.
**April 16: **Secretary Burgum issues the stop-work order that halts all offshore construction of Empire Wind 1. The order does not impact work on the [massive 73-acre wind terminal](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/wind/offshore-wind-hub-new-york-sunset-park) being built by about 1,500 people along a South Brooklyn waterfront to support the installation.

The company, which utilizes locally sourced fishing vessels and crews to provide scout and safety services, had been working on Empire Wind’s underwater rock installation.
**April 21: **Interior Secretary Doug Burgum “scientists at NOAA have revealed that the Biden administration’s rushed approval of the Empire Wind project was built on bad flawed science.” His social media posts imply that findings from federal scientists at NOAA are the basis for the unusual move.

A new state law set to take effect next month marks the end of New Hampshire’s flirtation with offshore wind — at least for now.
The 
“It’s definitely discouraging, practically and symbolically, when it comes to our region moving toward offshore wind as a meaningful part of the energy mix,” said Mireille Bejjani, co-executive director of New England-based environmental advocacy group Slingshot.
The move comes as President Donald Trump attempts to stop the emerging offshore wind industry in its tracks. On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order [pausing all permitting and lease sales](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/scare-tactics-and-uncertainty-what-trumps-offshore-wind-order-means) for new projects, and in the months that followed his administration has attempted to [halt the construction of fully permitted offshore wind](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/equinor-empire-trump-timeline) developments, including, most recently, the [nearly complete Revolution Wind project](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-admin-halts-construction-of-nearly-finished-offshore-wind-farm) off Rhode Island.
Other governors in New England, a region that has been counting on offshore wind for climate action and grid reliability, have been resolute in pushing projects forward. In fact, every coastal New England state aside from New Hampshire [is party to a lawsuit](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/wind/states-lawsuit-trump-pause-platkin) seeking to overturn Trump’s offshore wind executive order.
The law marks a shift from the stance taken by previous governor, Republican Chris Sununu, who was in office from 2017 to 2025.
Swing state New Hampshire has long been a libertarian-leaning outlier in deeply Democratic New England. On climate and energy issues, New Hampshire has generally been less aggressive than neighboring states: It doesn’t have legally mandated greenhouse gas reduction targets, has pulled back on energy-efficiency goals and programming, and recently all but [drained its renewable energy fund](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/renewable-fund-raid-leaves-future-of-popular-nh-solar-program-in-doubt) to pay for other state needs.
For a time, however, the state seemed on the verge of embracing offshore wind. In 2019, Sununu asked the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to convene a task force to facilitate regional cooperation and discussion about the potential for wind development in the Gulf of Maine. The next year, the state created a commission to study offshore wind and port development, and in 2021 the Office of Offshore Wind Industry Development and Energy Innovation was formed and funded. In 2022, the state released an 
“Offshore wind has the potential to realize many positive economic, energy, and environmental impacts for New Hampshire and our neighboring states,” Sununu wrote in the introduction to the report.
This year’s legislative session, however, saw a flurry of bills aimed at keeping the New Hampshire government out of the business of offshore wind. One proposal even 
The recently signed law is less aggressive, pulling away from offshore wind without prohibiting it. To soften the blow further, the state Senate, led by Democratic state Sen. David Watters, amended the legislation to make it clear that the energy innovation office would still have the authority to do work related to offshore wind if interest is revived in the future.
“The bill as it finally passed still kept a toehold in state government for being able to respond to or prepare for future offshore wind development,” Watters said.
During the legislative process, however, it was clear that many interested parties saw the bill as a referendum on offshore wind in general, not merely the structure of government offices and committees. Public comments during a House hearing on the bill in February dwelled heavily on the perceived dangers of offshore wind, including potential threats to wildlife, possible hikes in electricity prices, and concerns about the intermittent nature of wind power.
The movement against offshore wind, observers said, is driven by a mix of national conservative hostility toward renewable energy and New Hampshire’s unique character. The state Senate is reasonably open to renewables, Watters said. However, the 400-member House — the largest state legislative body in the country, by a wide margin — is far more averse, he said.
Furthermore, the state has always been fiscally conservative, priding itself on its lack of sales and personal income taxes. It was always unlikely to offer tax incentives, like neighboring states, or take the risk of getting locked into a power purchase agreement at prices that could exceed market rates, said Sam Evans-Brown, executive director of Clean Energy New Hampshire.
“New Hampshire was never going to be the state that drove the offshore wind industry,” he said.
Still, some clean energy advocates are concerned that the offshore wind law is a troublesome step backwards when the state needs to be charging ahead on renewables. There is widespread agreement that New England needs more power supply to help control soaring electricity prices and maintain grid reliability. At the same time, observers said, restraints on natural gas supplies make more gas-fired power generation unlikely, and building new nuclear facilities would be contentious; either option would take years to begin sending electrons into the grid.
Now, the Trump administration continues to throw up as [many](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/orsted-financial-struggles-trump-revolution-sunrise) [roadblocks](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-interior-revokes-leasing-areas) [as possible](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-tax-credits-marwin-delaware) to offshore wind, potentially scuttling what may be the region’s best — and speediest — chance to build large-scale energy generation.
It makes no sense to let ideological objections to renewable energy get in the way of considering all available resources, said Nick Krakoff, senior attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation.
“They’ll say they are for all-of-the-above energy, but don’t even want to consider offshore wind,” he said. “They’re not really looking at the full picture.”
For others, the new law is a reasonable response to political realities in New Hampshire. If the state was never going to be a major supporter of offshore wind, it makes sense to focus the Office of Energy Innovation on measures that might actually have a fighting chance, Evans-Brown said, pointing to microgrids, battery developments, demand-flexibility programs, and electrification as promising options that would help the state make the most of the power production it has.
Advocates and policymakers across the board, however, are holding on to hope that while the state explores other courses of action, the development of offshore wind is merely delayed.
“I do think [it] is likely to come back,” Watters said. “But I am a very pragmatic legislator: We’re just going to have to have a pause on offshore wind.”","Offshore wind, Policy regulation, Wind, Northeast, New Hampshire",new-hampshire-law-office-energy-innovation.md,articles_offshore-wind

With Trump’s pause, they are losing vital income.

The Trump administration’s order to stop construction of the nearly completed Revolution Wind project is putting hundreds of offshore workers out of a job — including dozens of local fishermen who voted for President Donald Trump and are asking him to reverse course.
A week ago, the acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Matthew Giacona, ordered the Danish wind developer Ørsted to [stop all offshore work on the Revolution Wind farm](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-admin-halts-construction-of-nearly-finished-offshore-wind-farm) so the federal government can​“address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States.” Giacona did not specify the nature of those security concerns.
Construction began on the 704-megawatt project in January 2024 and is now 80% complete, according to Ørsted. The wind farm is being built off the coast of Massachusetts and Rhode Island in a federally designated “wind energy area” that received sign-offs from multiple branches of the military, Canary Media reported Sunday.
Though often seen as opposed to offshore wind, many New England fishermen have [made peace with the industry](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/fishermen-trump-development-sea-services) in recent years.
They increasingly rely on part-time salaries from wind companies as fishing revenues dry up. Over the past two years, Ørsted put 80 fishermen to work on the Revolution Wind project, paying out $9.5 million to captains, deckhands, and fishing boat owners, according to Gary Yerman, a Connecticut-based fisherman who founded and leads a fisher cooperative called Sea Services North America, which has an active contract to work on Revolution Wind.
“Most of us are Trump voters, and we still believe in a leader who builds. That’s why we’re asking President Trump to reverse the stop-work order issued to Revolution Wind by Interior,” Yerman told Canary Media.
The stop-work order echoes a similar one the Interior Department gave in April that froze all offshore work on New York’s Empire Wind project — a move that grounded Sea Services’ fishermen for a month, until Trump [lifted the ban](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/equinor-empire-trump-timeline).
Yerman and other commercial fishermen remained quiet the last time Trump’s assault on a wind farm put them out of work. This time they’re speaking out.
“It’s madness to stop a project that already had permits,” said Jack Morris, a Massachusetts-based scalloper and manager for Sea Services who voted for Trump. “This is not something any of us planned for: the captains, the crew, the shore engineers, the people we buy food from for our trips.”
Sea Services captains Jack Morris, left, and Kevin Souza, right, pose on the Pamela Ann, a scalloping boat docked in New Bedford, Massachusetts, on Feb. 28, 2025, just before the boat embarked on a 10-day journey at sea to provide safety services to offshore wind construction vessels. (Clare Fieseler/Canary Media)
Ørsted was one of the first firms building turbines in U.S. waters to employ local fishermen, offering Sea Services a contract in 2021 to perform safety and scout tasks. The cooperative helped build Ørsted’s [South Fork Wind](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/wind/the-first-big-us-offshore-wind-farm-is-open-heres-whats-next) — America’s first large-scale offshore wind farm, which went online last year.
Today, it’s common for wind developers to rely on local U.S. fishermen. Avangrid and Vineyard Offshore, codevelopers of the embattled Vineyard Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts, have paid out about $8 million over the past two years directly to local fishermen and vessel owners.
“If the infrastructure and pilings are already in, what good is stopping now?” fisherman Tony Alvernaz told Canary Media when asked about the Revolution Wind pause. A Massachusetts fisherman unaffiliated with Sea Services, Alvernaz works part-time for Vineyard Wind, assisting with the ongoing construction of its 62 turbines. Of those, 17 are already 
Alvernaz is concerned about the Trump administration’s pattern of halting wind projects without warning and with little justification. Trump has already pressed pause on two of the five offshore wind farms currently under construction in America today.
## **Trump putting fishermen out of work**
In a statement Monday, an Ørsted spokesperson said Revolution Wind supports more than 2,500 jobs around the U.S., including “hundreds” of local offshore jobs.
Commercial fishermen have spent a total of 1,109 days working at sea for Revolution Wind, according to Yerman. Now, sitting at the docks due to the Trump administration’s stop-work order, the 15 fishermen who planned to be at sea, working 10-day shifts throughout this month, will get paid nothing.
“Our cooperative only invoices when our boats are on active duty. Fishermen are paid for the days they work, not for standby,” Gordon Videll, CEO of Sea Services, told Canary Media. The group is calling on Trump to lift the ban so that its members can resume the job, which would have involved eight more fishermen helping with an offshore substation this fall.
The extra income from Revolution Wind has been a lifeline, particularly for scallop fishermen who, in recent years, have been severely restricted in how much they can fish.
Strict federal quotas have been put in place to allow scallop populations to rebuild after years of being overfished, according to Morris, but that has meant scallopers — who form the majority of Sea Services’ members — are off the water for about 10 months a year.
Before the pause on Revolution Wind, scalloper Kevin Souza expected to make an additional $200,000 working on the project as a part-time boat captain for two years. Souza told Canary Media in February that, had he stuck to scalloping alone, he’d be “lucky” to earn $100,000 in a single year. The deckhands he hires only bring in around $30,000 per year working on scallop boats, but the offshore wind gig makes it possible for them to earn a “middle-class wage,” said Souza.
Souza has recruited both of his sons, his nephew, and other young people from longtime fishing families to work for the wind industry. They might have otherwise left the scallop industry if not for the supplemental income, he said.
## **Losing faith in Trump**
As a group, America’s commercial fishermen have long been loyal to Trump. Last week’s order is shaking that confidence.
“I can’t think of one guy who isn’t a Trumper in our co-op. We’re blue-collar guys (and some gals too) who get up before dawn, work with our hands, and we trusted him to look out for us. The truth is, we love President Trump,” Yerman said.
In New Bedford, Massachusetts, home to the country’s most profitable fishing port, “TRUMP 2024” flags fly from dozens of boats docked in the harbor. A few of those crews work for the offshore wind companies, and at least one captain lowers his MAGA flag before setting out to the wind farms, according to Rodney Avila, a Sea Services fisherman.
That kind of faith makes Trump’s pause on Revolution Wind even more gutting. 
“It’s like having the rug pulled out from under you. … Nobody understands why Trump did it. I don’t know what Trump’s agenda is,” said Morris.
Trump’s attacks on wind have dried up job prospects for local fishermen up and down the East Coast. His administration’s hostile actions have thrown sand in the gears of a [New Jersey wind farm](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/zeldin-atlantic-shores-permit-epa) that planned to start construction in the next three years, 
In addition to targeting individual projects, the Trump administration has initiated policies intended to [killing offshore wind leasing](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-interior-revokes-leasing-areas), [pausing permitting for wind farms](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/scare-tactics-and-uncertainty-what-trumps-offshore-wind-order-means), and [sunsetting tax credits](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-tax-credits-marwin-delaware) critical to their economic viability.
Many fishermen, including those who have pocketed thousands by working at offshore wind farms, remain wary of the companies building turbines out at sea.
“No fisherman loves new structures in the water, but we all have grandkids,” Roy Campanale, a Sea Services member based in Rhode Island, told Canary Media. “We’ve lived with the water getting warmer, watched the fish move north, and had to adapt again and again.”
Trump’s pause on Revolution Wind imposes yet another hardship.
Alvernaz voted for Trump and opposes certain wind farms that he believes pose a risk to his favorite fishing grounds. He said that he does not support Revolution Wind due to its placement on Cox Ledge, a swath of seabed identified by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as critical habitat for Atlantic cod.
But if Trump decides to freeze Vineyard Wind, for example, Alvernaz said he “would not be happy.”
Alvernaz has worked on the water for over 40 years. Yerman’s fishing career spans 50 years. With nearly a century of combined experience in New England’s waters, neither of them are buying the Trump administration’s excuse for pausing Revolution Wind.
“Something about national defense? How can it be an issue of national defense if there are other wind farms out there with the same technology?” pondered Alvernaz. “It’s kind of odd.”","Offshore wind, Politics, Wind, Northeast",fishermen-oppose-trump-revolution-halt.md,articles_offshore-wind

A big-budget offshore wind project that would clean up a contaminated California port and turn it into America’s first hub for floating wind turbines is the latest target of an increasingly emboldened national anti-offshore wind movement.
Representatives of a D.C.-based conservative think tank, Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), and a local California community group asked the U.S. Department of Transportation early this month to cancel a 5 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030 and 25 gigawatts by 2045.
Anti-wind activists told Canary Media they are looking to capitalize on the “timing” of a recent implosion of offshore wind plans in Maine, which — like California — sought to pioneer floating turbine technology in this country. Currently, all turbines operating or under construction in U.S. waters are fixed to the seafloor.
The move represents a westward spread of anti-wind activism from the East Coast, where longtime organized opposition has found [sympathetic ears](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/zeldin-atlantic-shores-permit-epa) as it petitions the Trump administration to tank permitted projects.
For example, in February, [reversed that decision](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/equinor-empire-trump-timeline) after a month, but the move signaled that opposition groups have gained traction.
“They are clearly feeling emboldened by Donald Trump,” said J. Timmons Roberts, a professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University, who studies networks of anti-wind activists. “They are taking these local victories on the East Coast and continuing to move along.”
Both CFACT and the California community group, 
The Humboldt project was awarded the DOT grant in January 2024 and a developer has not yet been announced, but it’s been five years in the making. Humboldt Bay Harbor, Recreation, and Conservation District has already used nearly $20 million in state and federal funds to design and permit much of the planned wharf. The federal grant includes additional funds for port expansion as well as environmental restoration, a solar array, trails, public kayaking access, and a fishing pier.
Earlier this month, CFACT and REACT Alliance [sent a letter](https://assets.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/REACT-ASlliance-DoT-Grant-Recission-Request-06-04-25.pdf) to DOT Secretary Sean Duffy challenging the project’s “public interest” grant requirement, citing the “lack of viability of the floating offshore wind ‘industry.’” The letter also points to Trump’s [anti-wind directive](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/scare-tactics-and-uncertainty-what-trumps-offshore-wind-order-means), which halted federal permitting and leasing for wind projects but did not mention grants for supporting wind infrastructure, like ports.
“We decided that the timing and the political will was there for us to go ahead and write this letter and to ask for the grant to be terminated,” said Mandy Davis, REACT Alliance’s president.
Davis told Canary Media that two recent setbacks in Maine’s pursuit of floating offshore wind motivated the group to act. First, Maine’s application for the same DOT grant awarded to the Humboldt Bay Harbor project was rejected in October. Those funds would have helped finance a port for floating offshore wind on Sears Island, Maine. Secondly, this spring, the Department of Energy 
Davis leads both REACT Alliance and the National Offshore Wind Opposition Alliance. She insists that neither of those groups receive any monetary support from CFACT, though the D.C. think tank co-signed the letter. CFACT has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from fossil-fuel groups over the years.
“CFACT has, for decades, been undermining the science of climate change and attacking efforts to address the issue. This is just their latest effort to destroy a climate solution,” said Roberts.","Offshore wind, Wind, West, California",california-port-trump-grant-cut.md,articles_offshore-wind
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/dominion-virginia-construction-trump,Massive Virginia offshore wind project presses on with construction,5 May 2025,Clare Fieseler,"Dominion said its wind project, the largest under construction in the U.S, will be completed on time — a bright spot for an industry facing turbulence.

The Trump administration turned the offshore wind industry on its head last month when it slapped a stop-work order on New York’s Empire Wind 1 project. The move launched local [protests](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-empire-brooklyn-jobs-terminal), and Empire’s developer is 
Dominion Energy resumed turbine installation at sunrise on Thursday last week, after the end of a federally mandated seasonal hiatus to protect migrating whales. The renewed construction marked the start of the second installation phase for a project that company executives said is 55% complete.
Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW), a 2.6-gigawatt project, has already installed 78 foundations for its 176 turbines and is generating 2,000 direct and indirect jobs for the local economy. Dominion has so far spent $6 billion on the monumental effort, which is 12 years in the making. The state-regulated utility in 2013 purchased the lease for the site about 30 miles offshore of Virginia Beach, Virginia, and [overcame anti-wind opponents](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/gop-think-tank-that-tried-to-stop-va-offshore-wind-now-says-go-ahead) that sought to thwart the project.
“I can’t speak for [Empire Wind], but we’ve been through a thorough permitting process,” G.T. Hollett, a director of offshore wind at Dominion Energy, told Canary Media on Wednesday at an annual industry meeting hosted by the Oceantic Network. “We feel reasonably sound that we are just going to continue keeping our head down, do the job, and bring this in on time.”
So far, the project hasn’t drawn President Donald Trump’s ire. But the company is wasting no time completing it. Finishing CVOW on schedule was a major theme of Dominion’s earnings call on Thursday.
“This project is consistent with the goal of securing American energy dominance,” said Bob Blue, the utility’s CEO, echoing rhetoric voiced by Trump. 
Blue reported that CVOW is “months away from first delivery of electricity to customers in early 2026” and on schedule for full completion by the end of next year. 
Much of CVOW’s success stems from the fact that it has garnered bipartisan support, including that of the state’s governor, Glenn Youngkin, a Republican. 
Despite all the progress, challenges still lurk, said Blue: “It’s difficult to fully assess the impact tariffs may have to the project’s final cost.”
The company estimates the project’s costs could rise about $120 million by the end of June due to tariffs. Cumulatively, the company could lose $500 million if tariffs remain in place until the end of 2026.
“Right now, everything is very slow … not just offshore wind,” said Justin Slater, an executive at Fincantieri Marine Group, which serves the shipyard industry. He believes the vessel builders that serve offshore wind and passenger ferrying could feel the impact of tariffs very soon.
That the Trump administration’s [animosity toward wind](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/zeldin-atlantic-shores-permit-epa) is taking a toll on the sector was clear at last week’s industry meeting in Virginia Beach, which was sponsored, in part, by CVOW.
“A lot of people are holding their breath right now,” said Gordon Videll, CEO of Sea Services North America, a co-op of fishermen that provide vessel services to wind developers. The company could lose millions of dollars if Empire Wind’s developer Equinor can’t continue construction. But the Virginia project ramping back up feels like a bright spot, Videll said.","Offshore wind, Clean energy, Utilities, Wind, Southeast, Virginia",dominion-virginia-construction-trump.md,articles_offshore-wind
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/empire-wind-construction-trump,Trump said no new offshore wind farms. One just got underway — quietly,9 April 2025,Clare Fieseler,"Empire Wind 1, located off the coast of New York City, is the first U.S. project to start at-sea wind turbine construction under Trump 2.0. 
Along with beginning at-sea construction, Empire Wind developer Equinor is making progress on a South Brooklyn Marine Terminal facility that will support the offshore project. (Equinor)
After eight years of planning and amid the Trump administration’s all-out assault on the sector, an offshore wind project outside of New York City quietly began at-sea construction this month.
Developer Equinor issued no press releases, held no ceremonies, and failed to respond to multiple inquiries about the construction milestone for its Empire Wind 1 project. Instead, a Listserv catering to boat captains and local residents posted “rock installation” around the turbines’ underwater bases would begin in April. Multiple insiders told Canary Media that work is now underway on those bases, which will minimize erosion around the first-ever wind turbines to connect to New York City’s power grid.
The lack of fanfare around an 810-megawatt wind farm effectively breaking ground less than 20 miles from America’s largest city speaks to the seismic shifts in messaging by renewable energy companies under Trump 2.0. While some firms are 
“There’s a bit of hesitancy to be out in front,” said Hillary Bright, executive director of Turn Forward, a nonprofit that advocates for U.S. offshore-wind businesses and sector growth. “It’s about not wanting to stick their heads up and drawing more attention, potentially, from the administration, which is already giving quite a bit of attention to offshore wind.”
President Donald Trump, more accurately, has put a bullseye on the industry’s back.
The president has called wind power “garbage,” “horrendous,” and “bullshit.” On the campaign trail, he made “windmills” a frequent focus of stump speeches and social media tirades. In the weeks leading up to his inauguration, Trump said [last year’s wind turbine failure](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/wind/vineyard-wind-1-cleared-to-resume-some-construction-after-blade-failure) at the Vineyard Wind project in Massachusetts.
Trump then [issued an executive order on Inauguration Day](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/scare-tactics-and-uncertainty-what-trumps-offshore-wind-order-means) that effectively froze all offshore wind permitting and leasing pending a federal review. Seemingly safe from the president’s pause at the time were nine projects, including Empire Wind 1, that already had their federal permits in hand. Since then, at least one of those permitted projects — [the 2.8-gigawatt Atlantic Shores project](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/nj-has-given-up-on-offshore-wind-for-now-whos-to-blame) off the New Jersey coast — has fallen apart. Others, like Dominion Energy’s

Both at-sea construction notices went out to subscribers of a public Listserv and have since been posted to the project’s 1 since Trump took office.
Empire Wind 1 is slated to finish construction by 2027, and when it does it will power 500,000 New York homes, according to the project’s website. It will also play an integral role in helping the state achieve its legislatively mandated target of [70% renewable energy by 2030](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/how-new-york-can-make-good-on-its-big-clean-energy-promises).
But Bright said she isn’t surprised that the company is avoiding the spotlight right now.
## **Wind opponents push to kill all projects**
An army of conservative think tanks are lobbying for a 
Empire Wind’s quiet kickoff this month caught the attention of U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican and longtime offshore wind opponent. In late March he penned a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in response to the “alarming development” of the project’s at-sea work and advised Burgum to “everything in your power.” Smith cited the president’s anti-wind memorandum alongside other claims, which lacked specifics, that Empire Wind could “blind” military radar or break apart during hurricanes.
Smith also claimed in his letter to Burgum that something similar to last year’s cargo ship collision with the Francis Scott Key Bridge could happen to one of Empire Wind’s turbines, writing “such a situation is more likely than many may think.” The fatal bridge collision occurred inside one of the Port of Baltimore’s designated shipping channels. While Empire Wind’s lease area is sandwiched between two shipping lanes, 
There’s no indication that the Interior Department has intervened in Empire Wind’s scheduled construction — yet.
In fact, agency officials are likely in close contact with Empire Wind’s developers, as is typical with all construction in federal waters. If Empire Wind 1 can avoid weather delays and political interference, the first steel monopile — the subsea part of a wind tower — could be driven into the seafloor as early as May. Undersea cable laying is scheduled for June, according to sources familiar with the project.
Plus, with rising energy demands and some of these multi-billion-dollar wind projects nearly complete, some Republicans see abandonment as [a risky move](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/gop-think-tank-that-tried-to-stop-va-offshore-wind-now-says-go-ahead).
## **More progress despite headwinds**
While the start of offshore work is a symbolic milestone, Empire Wind’s onshore construction is also ramping up.
Empire Wind’s Monday update email said the roof of the [project’s South Brooklyn Marine Terminal facility](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/wind/offshore-wind-hub-new-york-sunset-park) is nearing completion. According to the notice, excavation is underway at the spot where a future Brooklyn-based substation will connect wind-generated electricity to the city’s grid.
Research to monitor ecosystem impacts from this massive project is also progressing.
In late March, Duke University professor Doug Nowacek told Canary Media that he and his team of researchers were still planning to tag whales in the project’s lease area during the last week of April. The tagging is meant to take place just before pile-driving into the seafloor begins in early May, he explained.
“This is a unique opportunity to gather data on whale movements in the area both before and after a wind project is built,” said Nowacek, whose multi-year research on the 
Meanwhile, as the weather warms, marking the start of a new construction season, “things are moving forward” for the four other U.S. offshore wind projects that are underway, said Bright of Turn Forward.
In addition to Empire Wind, the other commercial-scale projects actively under construction are Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, Massachusetts’ Vineyard Wind 1, New York’s Sunrise Wind, and Revolution Wind, which is shared between Rhode Island and Connecticut.
The steady progress of some wind projects under Trump’s anti-wind order is noteworthy but not entirely unexpected.
Presidential executive orders are not “self-executing,” according to Mark Squillace, a law professor at the University of Colorado Law School. Squillace said they are akin to a memo penned to another leader, which in this case is the Secretary of the Interior.
Before entering Trump’s orbit, Secretary Burgum was a friend to wind energy as governor of North Dakota, a state that gets “to continue” even under political pressure to halt them.
Since his confirmation, Burgum has made negative comments about offshore wind — calling it [Construction of new gas plants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/utilities-are-flying-blind-on-data-center-demand-thats-a-big-problem) can’t keep up; the U.S. needs all the power it can get.
In countries like the U.K., offshore wind is already increasing grid reliability while delivering affordable energy.
In fact, while Equinor keeps its head down in America, the company is celebrating ongoing successes in Britain’s offshore wind sector, which the U.K. government calls 277-turbine North Sea project that will soon surpass

Chuck Schumer, Equinor, and Interior staff say Trump officials refuse to share NOAA documents that are the basis for Empire Wind’s costly stop-work order.

A massive New York offshore wind project may soon be abandoned mid-construction due to a mysterious report that few people in Washington appear to have seen except Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, one Fox News reporter, and the scientists who apparently wrote it.
“Scientists at [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] have revealed that the Biden administration’s rushed approval of the Empire Wind project was built on bad flawed science,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum 1 project and shocked the industry. His social media posts implied that findings from federal scientists at NOAA were the basis for the extreme measure. Construction can’t restart until the Interior Department performs “further reviews,” he wrote.
Those apparently damning NOAA findings, however, have not been made public. Burgum’s office did not respond to Canary Media’s requests to share them. Nor have they been shared with Equinor, the project developer. As of May 14, U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, hadn’t seen them either, 
“Nobody’s seen this report,” said a career employee at the Interior Department who Canary Media granted anonymity to speak freely for fear of retribution. “My personal opinion is that it’s all bullshit.”
The lack of clarity raises questions about the basis of the Interior Department’s initial decision, and what, exactly, its ongoing review is looking at. Desperate for an answer, Equinor has resorted to filing a Freedom of Information Act request for the report. That route could take months or years to deliver — time the project simply can’t afford.
The delays have created an “urgent, unsustainable situation,” according to one Empire Wind executive, who 50 million each week.
Empire Wind 1 comprises [a 73-acre onshore terminal](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-empire-brooklyn-jobs-terminal) and 54 turbines that were being built roughly 20 miles from New York City.

The Fox News journalist appears to be the first and only reporter to access the study’s contents. 
Industry groups fear Burgum’s order sets a dangerous precedent for vaporizing energy projects mid-construction on the premise of politics.
“Stopping work on the fully federally permitted Empire Wind 1 offshore project should send chills across all industries investing in and holding contracts with the United States government,” said Liz Burdock, president and CEO of Oceantic Network, an offshore wind industry group.
## **Interior staff left in the dark**
Documents obtained by Canary Media indicate that staffers in BOEM’s Office of Renewable Energy Programs (OREP) have been denied access to the report.
OREP is the government’s “hub” for offshore wind permitting and federal coordination, said the Interior employee who spoke with Canary Media. Its staff are in constant contact with offshore wind developers, the person added, from the time of lease purchase to the point where “steel goes in the water.” It’s not uncommon, they explained, for a developer and their assigned OREP point-of-contact to meet a few times each month.
The Interior employee said that personnel within OREP, including top-level figures, were not alerted of Burgum’s order until the day the news broke: “There was no BOEM press release … nothing internal went out.”
When it comes to the Empire Wind block, Burgum appears to be keeping BOEM in the dark. 
The Interior staffer said that, to their knowledge, no one at OREP has been explicitly asked to help with the ongoing review of Empire Wind’s approval that Burgum announced in April.
But a few days after the news broke, OREP was tapped to put together a spreadsheet that summarized “concerns” about Empire Wind, according to the Interior staffer. The summary was prepared by OREP staff and sent to one of the office’s supervisors within the last week, according to emails shared with Canary Media. The spreadsheet listed all concerns raised by the public and other federal agencies during 
For each concern raised about Empire Wind, OREP staff were instructed in an email seen by Canary Media to succinctly summarize “BOEM’s response, the extent to which the issue was fully addressed, BOEM’s view of whether the concern is mitigated, and whether there is new information that has been identified since [construction and operations] approval that would change the finding or outcome.”
The spreadsheet includes hundreds of concerns — whether they are valid or not — that the public submitted in response to the Empire Wind’s environmental impact assessment. OREP staff were instructed to capture as many of them as possible in this “summary.”
The Interior staffer said the whole exercise smacked of a fishing expedition — “saying there is a problem and then they have to go searching for a problem.” 
## **Wind company fails to nab report**
Equinor, the wind farm’s developer, has also been in the dark.
“The federal stop-work order from the Department of the Interior did not include information about the alleged deficiencies in the approval,” a spokesperson for Equinor told Canary Media.
Equinor has since submitted “repeated requests” to Burgum’s office for the NOAA report, according to the spokesperson, in addition to filing the FOIA request.
The Norwegian energy giant has already invested $2.7 billion into building the project’s onshore and offshore infrastructure. It’s anxious to know if it can still get a return on its investment — and turbines in the sea — but information has been hard to come by.
“While there have been some meetings, that does not include Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum,” Equinor’s spokesperson told Canary Media. Last week, an Equinor executive met with a top White House official, 
“If no progress is made within days, Equinor will be forced to terminate the project,” Molly Morris, president of Equinor Renewables Americas, told Bloomberg on Monday. “We are still fighting every day to find a resolution.”
Equinor is a familiar face in Washington. It has particularly long-standing relationships with conservatives, as the company has invested over $60 billion in the U.S. since the early 2000s, mostly in oil and gas. The company spokesperson said that “Equinor has over 100 oil and gas leases in the Gulf of America,” referencing the new name President Donald Trump bestowed on the Gulf of Mexico earlier this year.
Now, it’s Democrats who are backing Equinor and joining its call for Burgum to hand over the NOAA report. 
## **Schumer searches**
In “dictatorship” where whim reigns and due process dies.
“I call on [Commerce] Secretary Lutnick to immediately release the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report that was used as justification to halt work on the Empire Wind project. New Yorkers, Americans, the company, which invests heavily in America, deserve to know. Why halt this project? What’s the deal?” said Schumer on the U.S. Senate floor on Wednesday.
The senator also spelled out the incredible stakes should Equinor walk away.
Empire Wind is being developed under contract with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). According to Equinor, it will create roughly 2,500 new jobs in the New York area over the lifetime of the project. Roughly 1,000 of those employees are already at work.
Empire Wind 1 is also a critical component of New York’s strategy to address climate change and [get 70% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/how-new-york-can-make-good-on-its-big-clean-energy-promises). It’s the largest energy infrastructure project the state has undertaken in the last 50 years, according to NYSERDA President Doreen Harris, 
It’s also important for helping New York City meet its humongous and growing electricity needs.
Empire Wind 1 is one of the only “new capacity sources” slated to come online in the near term for New York City and Long Island, according to 1, and offshore wind in general, key to the city being able to provide reliable and affordable energy to its millions of residents.
In late April, CEO floated that the company was considering legal action against the U.S. government over its stop-work order. It’s the last lever the company has to pull to preserve the project. An Equinor spokesperson told Canary Media on Friday that the company’s stance on weighing legal options has not changed.
Schumer has heavily encouraged the firm to sue. “We think it’s illegal. And in fact, I have a call today into the head of [Equinor] to tell him to go to court, you’ll win the case,” “Our lawyers we’ve consulted think they have no basis to suspend it.”
The Interior employee shared Schumer’s sentiment.
“My personal hope is that Equinor does sue. Because I think what they would find during discovery is that we have no new information,” the employee said. “There’s nothing that was not already considered during the [permit] process that would warrant this change in decision.”","Offshore wind, Policy regulation, Politics, Wind, Northeast, New York",empire-equinor-interior-review-halt.md,articles_offshore-wind

Offshore wind leasing is effectively dead in the U.S. following a Trump administration order issued this week.
Large swaths of U.S. waters that had been identified by federal agencies as ideal for offshore wind are no longer eligible for such developments under an Interior Department statement released Wednesday.
In the BOEM) said the U.S. government is “de-designating over 3.5 million acres of unleased federal waters previously targeted for offshore wind development across the Gulf of America, Gulf of Maine, the New York Bight, California, Oregon, and the Central Atlantic.”
The move comes just a day after Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered his staff “unreliable.” Analysts say that offshore wind power can be a 
The outlook was already grim for new offshore wind leasing activity following President Donald Trump’s [executive order in January](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/scare-tactics-and-uncertainty-what-trumps-offshore-wind-order-means) that introduced a temporary ban on the practice. Wednesday’s announcement makes that policy more definitive. Wind power advocates say it will erase several years of work from federal agencies and local communities to determine the best possible areas for wind development.
“My read on this is that there is not going to be any leasing for offshore wind in the near future,” said a career employee at the Interior Department, who Canary Media granted anonymity so they could speak freely without fear of retribution.
Figuring out the best spot to place offshore wind is an involved undertaking. The proposed areas start off enormous and, according to the Interior staffer, undergo a careful, multiyear winnowing process to settle on the official “wind energy area.” Smaller lease areas are later carved out of these broader expanses.
Take the process for designating the wind energy area known as “2023 and is now dead in the water.
The draft area — or “call area” — started out as a thick belt roughly 40 miles wide and reached from the southernmost tip of New Jersey to the northern border of South Carolina, according to maps on BOEM’s website. Multiple agencies, including the Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, and NASA, then provided input on where that initial area might have been problematic. NASA, for example, maintains a launch site on Virginia’s Wallops Island and in 2024 found that nearby 
The winnowing didn’t stop there. By 2024, according to BOEM’s website, its staff was 2026, based on a timeline posted to BOEM’s website.
But the Trump administration is no friend to offshore wind.
Trump officials have repeatedly targeted wind projects by [pulling permits](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/zeldin-atlantic-shores-permit-epa) and even [halting one wind farm during construction](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-empire-brooklyn-jobs-terminal). Last month, Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” sent federal tax credits to an early grave, requiring wind developers who want to use the incentives to either start construction by July 2026 or place turbines in service by the end of 2027. The move is [particularly devastating](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-tax-credits-marwin-delaware) for offshore projects not already underway. Currently, five major offshore wind farms are under construction in the U.S., and when they come online, they will help states from Virginia to Massachusetts meet their rising energy demand with carbon-free power.

These wind energy areas could hypothetically be re-designated by a future administration or the policy reversed, according to the Interior Department employee. Still, in the best case, that means developers will have to wait several more years for new lease areas to become available, further slowing down an industry whose projects already take many years to go through permitting and construction.","Offshore wind, Policy regulation, Wind",trump-interior-revokes-leasing-areas.md,articles_offshore-wind

Now Interior wants a judge to cancel the wind farm’s approvals.

Maryland’s first offshore wind farm could have broken ground next year. But now the 114-turbine renewable energy project is all but doomed following the Trump administration’s most recent move in a long line of attacks on the industry. 
In a [motion](https://assets.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/OC-Lawsuit-Motion-for-Remamd-With-Vacatur-1.pdf) filed Friday with the U.S. District Court in Maryland, the Interior Department asked a judge to cancel approval of the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, which was authorized in the final weeks of the Biden administration. The wind farm was expected to power over 718,000 homes in a Democrat-led state facing rocketing energy demands.
Officials claim that the agency’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management made an “error” when assessing the turbines’ potential impact on other activities — like search-and-rescue operations and fishing — within the 80,000-acre swath of ocean where the wind farm would be located.
The project is over a decade in the making, with developer US Wind purchasing the lease in 2014. But after President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July and [greatly shortened the duration](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/tax-credit-changes-trump-law) of the wind energy tax credit, Maryland’s first offshore wind farm already [seemed impossible to pull off](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-tax-credits-marwin-delaware) — at least economically.
Harrison Sholler, an offshore wind analyst with BloombergNEF, told Canary Media in July that with the tax credits sunsetting at a much earlier date, the Maryland project would likely no longer be able to offset 30% of its costs. The original rule for receiving the incentives required construction to start by 2033 or potentially even later, but the new law stipulates that wind farms must be “placed in service” by the end of 2027 or begin construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify.
Onshore construction is not supposed to start 2028, so the new deadline for receiving tax credits was crushing. Also, US Wind doesn’t have its financing in place yet to underwrite construction, according to Sholler. Securing financing without those credits guaranteed is a hard sell.
Analysts saw the tightening of the tax credit’s timeframe down to this one-year sprint as the final nail in the coffin for offshore wind farms that were fully approved but not currently underway.
Two projects — MarWin, the first phase of the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, and New England Wind off the Massachusetts coastline — exist in that gray zone. If the judge yanks its approval, MarWin will almost certainly be mothballed for the rest of Trump’s tenure.
Four offshore wind farms are currently being built in America’s waters. A fifth project, Revolution Wind, is 80% complete, but Interior Secretary Doug Burgum abruptly[ paused its construction](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-admin-halts-construction-of-nearly-finished-offshore-wind-farm) in August, citing “national security” concerns.

Revolution Wind can officially resume. But unlike the last time President Donald Trump ordered construction on an offshore wind project to pause, relief came through the courts rather than politicking.
A federal judge on Monday ruled in favor of the Danish energy giant Ørsted, whose $6.2 billion Rhode Island project was [halted last month](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-admin-halts-construction-of-nearly-finished-offshore-wind-farm) by the Interior Department without, as the judge put it, any “factual findings.” A similar stop-work order that froze construction on New York’s Empire Wind [was lifted by Trump officials](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/equinor-empire-trump-timeline) in May following one month of heavy lobbying — and 
Judge Royce Lamberth, a Reagan-era appointee serving the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, granted a motion for a preliminary injunction [sought by Revolution Wind](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/orsted-states-sue-trump-revolution-halt) to resume turbine construction while its complaint against the Interior Department works its way through the courts, which could take years. The project is 80% complete, and Ørsted released a statement on Monday saying workers will restart “
Monday’s decision marked a victory for Revolution Wind and could have broader legal ramifications for Trump’s ongoing war against offshore wind energy, given that several projects are still tangled up in litigation. And, if the recent ruling is any indication, the Trump administration may have a hard time convincing judges that walking away from already-approved wind farms makes sense.
“The Trump Administration’s erratic action was the height of arbitrary and capricious, and failed to satisfy any statutory provisions needed to halt work on a fully approved and nearly complete project. It was not a close call,” Connecticut’s Attorney General William Tong, a Democrat, 
## **All eyes on the courts now**
Twelve other high-profile lawsuits are actively challenging Biden-era approvals for eight U.S. wind farms, according to the research firm ClearView Energy Partners. Traditionally, the government defends projects it’s already greenlit. Legally, however, it can pick and choose which approvals to stand up for.
For example, three of those projects — New England Wind, SouthCoast Wind, and the Maryland Offshore Wind Project — could soon lose their federal approvals. None of the three have started construction yet, but in the past month, government officials have filed documents in court for each, trying to undo approvals granted by the Biden administration.
“These other cases are different procedurally, but [the Revolution Wind ruling] shows that the courts are taking this seriously and that the Trump administration took these actions without sufficient justification,” said Nick Krakoff, a senior attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation.
The latest blow came on Thursday, when government lawyers 141-turbine project slated for federal waters near Massachusetts’s coastline. Krakoff said that the legal argument is nearly identical to [one filed in the U.S. District Court of Maryland](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-cancel-permits-maryland-marwin-project) the week prior seeking to take back approvals from the Maryland Offshore Wind Project.
Both filings invoke a new legal interpretation of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act that argues that the Interior Department must weigh other ocean activities — like commercial fishing and Coast Guard operations — in an “absolutist approach,” said Krakoff, to evaluate potential conflicts with wind farms.
The standard interpretation, employed for almost a decade by past administrations and already upheld in [a 2024 court decision](https://assets.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Seafreeze-Shoreside-Inc-v-United-States-Department-of-the-Interior.pdf), instructs agencies to take a more balanced approach to evaluating multiple ocean users.
“It’s not unprecedented for a new administration to switch positions. But it is unprecedented to seek to remand a permit because of it,” said Krakoff, who called the Trump-era interpretation of the law a “coordinated attack” on thousands of clean energy jobs.
Oddly, the Trump administration appears to be defending some wind projects at the center of these legal challenges while trying to tank the three others.
For example, on Sept. 8, the Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management filed a letter signalling that it wants to dismiss a lawsuit brought by the anti-wind group Protect Our Coast NJ that challenges New York’s Empire Wind.
Then there is the exceptional case of Virginia. Earlier this month, EE News reported that House Speaker Mike Johnson (R) GOP support may explain why the Trump administration has not tried to remand approvals for the Virginia project in response to a lawsuit brought by the Heartland Institute and other right-leaning think tanks challenging its construction. Instead, on Friday, government lawyers asked the judge for a 90-day extension on filing a report on the Virginia project’s status.
Being inconsistent in when and how it deploys new legal interpretations could backfire for the Trump administration.
On Monday, Lamberth told government lawyers that “mandating the immediate pause to construction of a project whose approval the Bureau continues to defend in other cases is the height of arbitrary and capricious.”
## **Lawmakers weigh in**
Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are clearly frustrated that most of the offshore wind projects in Trump’s crosshairs are in solidly blue states at a moment when they have little power in Congress to fight back. Many Democrats see the courts as the best hope for surmounting the administration’s continued efforts to block the development of wind power, which they view as necessary for meeting growing electricity demand.
“One of our most important roles right now is to illustrate to people that the actions taken by this administration are creating shortages and … spikes in your [electricity] prices. Second is the litigation pathway,” Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, said during a press call on Monday.
The longtime climate hawk discussed new data showing that electricity prices in the U.S. have “success.”
Revolution Wind’s stop-work order had been bleeding its developers of “more than $2 million per day,” according to court filings, and posing [a risk to New England’s future grid reliability](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-revolution-halt-disaster-new-england-grid).
“The time frame to get a new law in place and enforce that new law is unlikely to match up with the time frame of a developer who is almost invariably working on borrowed money and can’t wait three and a half years while we sort ourselves,” said Schatz.
For Revolution Wind, Monday’s legal victory may only be temporary — federal officials could appeal the ruling. A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment. A similar but separate lawsuit challenging Revolution Wind’s stop-work order, brought by the attorneys general of Rhode Island and Connecticut, is winding its way through the courts. Last week, the feds requested that this case be transferred to the U.S. District Court in D.C.

The Trump administration’s latest attack on an in-progress offshore wind project is now being challenged in court.

Hours later, attorneys general from both Rhode Island and Connecticut announced a 
If allowed to proceed, the project would generate enough carbon-free electricity to power more than 350,000 households across the two states. Should President Donald Trump tank the development, it would [be a disaster for New England’s grid](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-revolution-halt-disaster-new-england-grid).
The project was set to come online next year, and New England’s grid operator had already factored its 704 megawatts into its plans. Delaying delivery of that power on such short notice “will increase risks to reliability,” ISO New England warned in a statement last week, adding that the hold-up could also increase utility bills and discourage future investment. [even local fishermen](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/fishermen-oppose-trump-revolution-halt) have also demanded Trump overturn his decision.
“Does this sound like a federal government that is prioritizing the American people? This is bizarre, this is unlawful, this is potentially devastating, and we won’t stand by and watch it happen,” said Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha in a statement.
The lawsuit comes as the Trump administration steps up its already hostile campaign against offshore wind. There’s new chaos almost daily.
Since ordering Revolution Wind to stop construction in late August, the administration has filed documents with federal courts signaling it intends to revoke permits for projects 
In choosing litigation over negotiation, the moves made on Thursday mark a shift in how the wind industry is responding to the U.S. government’s new war on the energy resource.
When the Interior Department stopped New York’s Empire Wind project in April, developer Equinor opted not to take the Trump administration to court — even as its losses rose to nearly $1 billion. Instead, the firm and diplomats from its home country and majority shareholder Norway lobbied the government to overturn its decision. In May, the Trump administration [reversed course](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/equinor-empire-trump-timeline), claiming that it had struck a deal with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) to allow gas pipelines in the state. Hochul’s office denies any such deal was made.
In both instances, the Trump administration used vague and dubious justifications for the stop-work orders.

Then oil rigs. Now, it’s offshore wind turbines that are becoming artificial reefs for creatures from haddock to lobster.

When ecologist Anthony Bicknell went looking for fish around the foundations of wind turbines a dozen or so miles off the coast of Scotland in the North Sea, he wasn’t sure what he’d find.
But he was ready for something surprising. Around that time, some European lobsters were catching researchers off guard by taking up residence in wind turbine foundations in the waters off of the British Isles. Sure enough, Bicknell and his team counted two more sea creatures that scientists had never documented congregating around wind turbines: a flatfish known as a dab and, most strikingly, haddock.
Haddock is one of Scotland’s highest-value commercial fish, ranking above cod and just below herring in total number of fish caught annually. Unlike cod, haddock don’t usually hang out around shipwrecks and other human-made structures on the seafloor.
The discovery that these sleek silvery fish are utilizing wind foundations, described in 
Offshore wind is growing rapidly in some parts of the world, particularly in northern Europe and China, as nations look to complement other carbon-free resources like solar.
In the U.S., the industry has faced opposition from the fishing industry, environmentalists, and other anti-wind groups who have raised concerns about how turbines will affect marine life. False claims about offshore wind’s impact on ocean animals — especially whales — have been spread by opponents including President Donald Trump, who [issued an executive order](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/scare-tactics-and-uncertainty-what-trumps-offshore-wind-order-means) on his first day in office that has slowed the industry to a crawl.
The new study from Bicknell, a senior research fellow at the University of Exeter, is the latest in a growing body of research that suggests offshore wind turbines, like other hard structures introduced to the seabed, can not only coexist with marine life but potentially benefit certain species.
Scientists have repeatedly found, for example, that an oil rig or oil platform can become an oasis of hard structure in ocean expanses devoid of much else but sand. They attract barnacles, shellfish, invertebrates, and, eventually, the fish that like to eat those creatures. An entire food web can grow.
Studies like Bicknell’s find the same phenomenon is playing out around some wind turbines installed on the seafloor of the North Sea. Except, unlike oil rigs, these massive pieces of infrastructure are helping to reduce the carbon emissions caused by burning fossil fuels, which is rapidly warming the ocean and devastating marine life worldwide.
Bicknell and his coauthors discovered that the older the wind foundation, the more fish — and sometimes bigger fish — like to call it home. This is true, they found, for many demersal fish like flatfish, haddock, and cod, which sit lower on the food chain. His team focused on the U.K. offshore wind farms known as Beatrice and Moray East; some of the studied turbines were built in 2017, while others went in around 2020.
These studies also underscore that offshore wind farms are clearly changing the ocean. Scientists are still debating which species are most feeling the change. 
“Are they good or bad for fish? The caveat is, well, what fish?” said Bicknell.
Take the case of the European lobsters that like to turn wind foundations into homes. In 2021, 
For haddock, the turbines are more like a buffet. Bicknell described the fish as enjoying what he and other scientists call “indirect benefits.” Because haddock don’t usually hang around hard structures, preferring instead the sandy sea bottom, the groups that showed up on the researchers’ underwater cameras likely come there to feed and then leave. His study provides more evidence that wind foundations may increase the availability of food for many fish.
Some of these discoveries are helping researchers in the U.S., where offshore wind has been slow to catch on. Five projects are actively under construction in the country, but only one commercial-scale offshore wind project, South Fork Wind, is in operation today. Meanwhile, the U.K. has over 40 offshore wind installations with a total capacity of 15 GW plugged into its grid.
“I think when it comes to surveying offshore wind infrastructure for fish, yes, we are a little bit behind,” said Brendan Runde, a marine ecologist with The Nature Conservancy who is based in Virginia.
Runde is part of an ongoing research project to understand how fish use two wind turbines installed off the coast of Virginia as part of a 2020 pilot by Dominion Energy. This installation — and the fish that use it — serve as a glimpse of what’s to come in the region’s waters. Less than a mile away, the state’s first commercial-scale project is under construction and, according to its developer Dominion, on track to be completed in 2026.

During construction, wind farms could have negative effects on fish, said Runde.
Artificial noise, changes to seafloor sediment, and newly laid cables that emit electromagnetic fields can all impact fish in the short-term. However, his team’s research has found that the Atlantic sturgeon, an endangered species, and a variety of sharks are not avoiding the area even during ongoing construction.
At least [78 wind foundations have already been installed](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/gop-think-tank-that-tried-to-stop-va-offshore-wind-now-says-go-ahead) off the coast of Virginia, according to Dominion, while new ones continue to be built in spite of federal headwinds from Trump. In Virginia, offshore wind has a history of bipartisan support, and Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, is a vocal supporter of Dominion’s 2.6-gigawatt, 176-turbine project.
Runde’s research is ongoing and must now endure a challenging political moment for the offshore wind sector. In addition to calling wind farms “garbage” and vowing to [gutted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-fires-noaa-scientists-helping-whales-and-offshore-wind-coexist) of staff and resources in recent months. Runde actively collaborates with NOAA scientists on this research, and his project itself is funded by the NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center.
When it comes to measuring the long-term benefits of these structures, Runde and his team use some of the same methods as their British counterparts: baited remote underwater video, which measures fish abundance, size, and diversity at the pilot turbines. The foundations they explore can reach depths of 120 feet below the water’s surface.
Black sea bass are already making homes out of these foundations. Runde said that one fish that was tagged at a Virginia wind foundation in February 2024 was still there seven months later when he returned.
“We know that, for many species of fish, this wind foundation is a really big deal,” said Runde.","Offshore wind, Clean energy, Wind",fish-turbines-reef-research.md,articles_offshore-wind

Now anti-wind groups are trying to leverage a Republican-run EPA.

The Environmental Protection Agency revoked an essential Clean Air Act permit last month from Atlantic Shores, an offshore wind development slated to be built off the New Jersey coast. One of the main justifications was [President Donald Trump’s January executive order](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/scare-tactics-and-uncertainty-what-trumps-offshore-wind-order-means) calling for a halt and reexamination of the fledgling offshore wind industry.
The move suggests the agency, which has historically played a relatively small role in wind development, may be joining Trump’s assault on a renewable sector that many blue states are counting on to slash their planet-warming emissions and 
Lee Zeldin, one of President Trump’s first allies in Congress, now heads the EPA. Anti-wind groups have speculated in emails with Canary Media that Zeldin is sympathetic to their cause. One group has already submitted a “copycat” petition in hopes of convincing the agency to yank the same type of permit from Vineyard Wind in Massachusetts, a 
Permits are now the golden tickets of offshore wind. 
Depending on the location and size of the project, an offshore wind farm needs to secure between eight and 10 federal permits before the first turbine can be built.
If you don’t already have them, you’re effectively locked out of building a wind farm over the next several years given Trump’s directive to freeze new permitting. Only nine projects in the U.S. — including Atlantic Shores — had all the necessary permits in hand when Trump took office again in January. But as indicated by the case of Atlantic Shores, even having all the paperwork in order may not be enough to keep projects from being crippled by the Trump administration’s assault on wind.
Most of the necessary federal permits are examined and issued by the Interior Department. But only the EPA or one of its regional delegates can give out the Clean Air Act permits that are required to ensure wind companies minimize air pollution during construction and operation.
The EPA appeals board has a history of pulling these permits from energy or industrial projects when appropriate, according to the letter of the Clean Air Act. Presidential orders are not typically a meaningful factor.
“It’s not unprecedented,” said Stan Meiburg, a former acting deputy administrator of the EPA, referring to the use of a presidential order in this kind of agency decision. “But it still seems unusual that you would cite it that heavily in a case.” The decision comes as Zeldin moves to dramatically reshape the agency.
He has floated plans to [claw back $20 billion of funds](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/trump-epa-aims-to-claw-back-20b-in-green-bank-funds) Congress had already approved for clean energy projects. In early March, he released an extensive plan that aims to “more affordable to purchase a car, heat homes, and operate a business.”
It’s a remarkable shift not only for the agency but for Zeldin himself, who began his political career as a moderate blue state Republican before morphing into what The New York Times described in a recent profile as the cabinet’s “
That transformation was on display in his confirmation hearing held in January.
“When asked about wind power, he spouted fossil fuel–funded talking points about harms to marine life,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, at a meeting of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works to vote on Zeldin’s confirmation.
The EPA’s appeals board — which has a decades-long track record of independence — could now theoretically become caught up in Zeldin’s crusade against clean energy, too, argued Meiburg.
In 1992, the Environmental Appeals Board was formed as “an impartial appellate tribunal” to resolve regulatory disputes. The four-judge panel is staffed by long-time EPA attorneys who are senior career officials — not political appointees. In the agency’s early years, disputes were settled by the administrator directly, but the workload became overwhelming. In the three decades that followed its establishment, the board evolved from an extension of the administrator’s office to an independent body untethered from politics. According to “cannot be appealed to the EPA Administrator.” In other words, the board has the final say.
“The value of the Environmental Appeals Board as an institution has derived from the fact that they are seen as independent,” said Meiburg, who now serves as executive director of Wake Forest University’s Andrew Sabin Family Center for Environment and Sustainability. “And they want to make sure to preserve that independence and integrity because that’s the basis of some of their credibility.”
Zeldin could reverse course, exerting more political pressure on the board or firing its judges.
“The Environmental Appeals Board is independent of all EPA components outside the immediate office of the Office of the Administrator,” said an EPA spokesperson via email. “It is an impartial appellate tribunal established by regulation to hear administrative appeals under the major environmental statutes that EPA administers.”
On March 14, Environmental Appeals Board Judge Mary Kay Lynch EPA calls it, a Clean Air Act permit issued last September to Atlantic Shores. Companies can appeal the board’s remand decisions in federal court but, according to Meiburg, most of those appeals fail. Overall, less than 1% of the board’s final decisions have been reversed.
EPA officials working in the Region 2 office in the Northeast had recommended in February a reexamination of the permit, in light of Trump’s anti-wind order and in response to a formal petition, filed in October, from a local anti-wind group called Save Long Beach Island. Along with other concerns, the group had raised questions about the impact on wildlife at a nearby refuge.
Atlantic Shores contested the decision, which moved the dispute to the EAB judges’ desk.
The project’s lawyers argued that Trump’s anti-wind order — the EAB’s main justification for pulling the permit — should not be retroactively applied to a permit that was issued in September, well before his election.
But Judge Lynch wrote “broad discretion” in pulling permits, handing a win to the EPA officials and another blow to Atlantic Shores. The judges offered no opinion on the actual merits of the original petition about nearby wildlife, according to Meiburg.
The revoked permit came after the project was already faltering in the face of [rising costs from inflation and waning support](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/nj-has-given-up-on-offshore-wind-for-now-whos-to-blame) from the state’s lame-duck governor. Shell, one of the project’s partners, pulled out in January.
“Atlantic Shores is disappointed by the EPA’s decision to pull back its fully executed permit as regulatory certainty is critical to deploying major energy projects,” Atlantic Shores spokesperson Terence Kelly wrote in a statement.
Lawyers working in the environmental field expressed similar concerns.
“My first reaction was disappointment — these are projects that had gone through extensive review by the agency. It seems to be invoking a tangential issue here,” said Kate Sinding Daly of the Conservation Law Foundation, a nonprofit that has brought numerous cases to the agency’s appeals board.
She explained that Atlantic Shores’ air permit application will now be reexamined. Most revoked Clean Air Act permits are eventually reissued, sometimes with modifications, but it’s unclear what will happen with Zeldin at the helm given Trump’s order to halt permitting activity.
Sinding Daly also raised concern about the ACK for Whales to challenge Vineyard Wind’s Clean Air Act permit.
That petition argues that the EPA did not properly anticipate emissions from wind turbine malfunctions, such as the [Vineyard Wind blade accident,](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/wind/vineyard-wind-1-cleared-to-resume-some-construction-after-blade-failure) which left the developer with almost a year of extra at-sea work and thus created extra emissions from the ships working on the project. The wind farm is slated to come online later this year, feeding renewable energy from near Nantucket Sound to the state’s energy grid.
“We’re hopeful that our petition to EPA will be carefully reviewed as we believe our concerns are valid,” said Amy DiSibio, a member of ACK for Whales, in an email.
Sinding Daly said the group’s petition addresses a more narrow provision in the law and pointed out that it’s been submitted years after the original air permit was issued, instead of just weeks, like with Atlantic Shores. She doubts that the Massachusetts petition will be successful. But when asked about potential “copycat” Clean Air Act petitions elsewhere, directed at other U.S. wind projects, she said she still considers them a “threat.”
Historically, she said, the agency has focused on protecting public health and the environment. But the remit is different now under Zeldin — and the EPA has just enough permitting authority over large infrastructure projects to slow down turbine installations in line with the Trump 2.0 mandate.","Offshore wind, Clean energy, Politics, Wind, Northeast, New Jersey",zeldin-atlantic-shores-permit-epa.md,articles_offshore-wind

Ørsted stages and assembles wind turbines at Connecticut's State Pier Terminal. (Ørsted)
Europe’s largest wind energy company was brought to its knees last week by a market it helped create.
Ørsted, the Danish energy giant that 9.4 billion to complete its two remaining U.S. offshore wind projects and to continue to be financially sound enough to build wind farms elsewhere — likely in places far away from the United States.
During its Aug. 11 earnings call, Ørsted blamed its funding needs on “adverse developments” in the U.S. market, referring to the political risk, red tape, and tax credit changes created in recent months by Trump administration policies. Ørsted’s investor presentation described these MAGA headwinds as “unexpected developments outside our control.”
The announcement follows a series of setbacks for foreign offshore wind developers that were once seen as essential to fulfilling the decarbonization goals set by the U.S. government and many Northeastern states.
In January, the U.K.’s Shell [exited](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/nj-has-given-up-on-offshore-wind-for-now-whos-to-blame) the now-defunct Atlantic Shores wind project slated for the waters near New Jersey, [and failed](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/equinor-empire-trump-timeline) — to cancel.
Though intensified by the current administration, the industry’s financial troubles began even before Trump took office. One year ago, Ørsted 704-megawatt Revolution Wind project near Rhode Island. Two years ago, it booked a more than 1 and 2 projects off New Jersey’s coastline.
“‘Come to America and lose a billion dollars’ should be the headline of your article,” said Elizabeth Wilson, a wind energy expert and professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College, in an interview with Canary Media.
Denmark, which owns half of Ørsted, is backing the new fundraising effort in which the company will issue new shares worth about 45% its total value. It’s a fallback plan resulting from Ørsted’s failure to sell part of its ownership stake in Sunrise Wind, a 924-megawatt wind farm under construction near Long Island, New York. The project is more than one-third of the way built and is slated for completion by the end of 2027, but no one wanted to buy into it at a workable price.
Selling off a stake of Sunrise Wind was always part of the plan; the proceeds were meant to cover a large chunk of its construction. Now that would-be buyers are avoiding Trump’s chaos, Ørsted is left footing the entire bill. The firm’s other active U.S. project, Revolution Wind, is 80% complete and is expected to be fully operational by the second half of 2026, the company announced during the call.
But despite assurances that both Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind will be finished, even at a steep cost to the firm, Ørsted — according to Wilson — is unlikely to invest in American offshore wind again. Ørsted did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.
“What developers really need is market certainty,” said Wilson, who wasn’t surprised that Ørsted could not find a buyer for Sunrise Wind. Trump’s presidency has brought too much risk, she explained.
Trump [issued an executive order](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/scare-tactics-and-uncertainty-what-trumps-offshore-wind-order-means) on Inauguration Day that froze all offshore wind permitting and leasing pending a federal review. Seemingly safe at the time were eight projects, including Ørsted’s Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind, that already had all their federal permits in hand. Of those fully permitted projects, [the 2.8-gigawatt Atlantic Shores project](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/nj-has-given-up-on-offshore-wind-for-now-whos-to-blame) off the New Jersey coast has since fallen apart.

The community is pushing back.

One sign read “Let the Wind Power Our Future.” Others displayed nothing more than the giant gold seal of America’s largest electrical workers union. These logos and slogans stood out among the 100 or so people crowded on top of the marble steps of the Nassau County Executive and Legislative Building in New York on Tuesday, as they called for the right to continue building offshore wind turbines near the Long Island coast.
That right had just been revoked.
On April 16, the Trump administration issued a 810-megawatt wind farm was two weeks into [at-sea construction](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/empire-wind-construction-trump). It’s also the anchor project of an in-progress effort to build an offshore wind staging terminal in South Brooklyn, which has been celebrated as a major economic win for the local, mainly working-class community.
“It was time to demonstrate the diverse support for offshore wind,” said Adrienne Esposito, rally organizer and executive director of the nonprofit group Citizens Campaign for the Environment. She said the group includes retirees, union workers, young people in job training, a charter boat captain, and a whale expert.
They’re emblematic of the broad array of stakeholders who stand to lose from President Donald Trump’s ongoing war on offshore wind, which [started with a pause on new permitting](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/scare-tactics-and-uncertainty-what-trumps-offshore-wind-order-means) and has in recent weeks escalated to attacks on projects already underway. These projects are central to the climate goals of many East Coast states, the economic development plans of 
## **Betting on wind to revive a community**
Empire Wind 1 is a critical component of New York’s strategy to address climate change and achieve a 70% renewable energy share by 2030. It’s the 50 years, according to a top state official who lambasted the Trump administration’s stop-work order as doing “irrefutable harm.”
“This project underwent extensive and robust federal reviews … and is already under construction with strong support from the local Sunset Park community and more than 1,500 construction workers currently employed,” Doreen Harris, president of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, said in a statement last week.
Since early April, vessels had been laying rocks roughly 20 miles offshore from New York City in preparation for attaching 54 wind towers to the seafloor in May. The project was supposed to go online in 2027. All at-sea work is now halted.
The Trump administration’s order didn’t impact the massive terminal being built along a Brooklyn waterfront to support the installation. About 1,500 people have been [constructing the 73-acre offshore wind hub](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/wind/offshore-wind-hub-new-york-sunset-park) since June. But local supporters now worry what the order means for all the green jobs promised by the Empire Wind project.
“Offshore wind, if done properly, gave us a real shot at creating economic opportunities for a neighborhood and region that has carried the weight of environmental racism for too long. It meant good jobs and local investment for our local residents,” Elizabeth Yeampierre wrote in a statement issued Tuesday, the same day as the rally. She is executive director of the grassroots nonprofit organization, UPROSE, and a longtime resident of Brooklyn’s Sunset Park neighborhood.
For the past decade, Yeampierre has [led efforts in her community](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/just-transition/power-by-the-people-green-resilient-industrial-district-sunset-park) to advocate for redevelopment of Sunset Park’s industrialized waterfront, a stretch of which has sat vacant since the 1990s. At one point, city officials considered plans to rezone the area for apartments and retail shops. Yeampierre pushed officials instead towards plans to rebuild a “working” waterfront that would generate jobs and place Sunset Park residents at the center of the energy transition.
That vision, the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, is becoming a reality. The offshore wind hub, once completed by the end of 2026 if it’s not interrupted, will be used for storing and assembling wind turbines. Equinor, the Norwegian energy giant building Empire Wind, was planning to use it as a staging ground for not just Empire Wind but for a sprawling array of already-approved wind projects being built across the Northeast and mid-Atlantic by various developers.
The previous administration gave some level of approval to nearly a dozen offshore wind farms. But only nine projects, including Empire Wind, managed to get all of their permits before Trump took office. Another one of those approved projects — Atlantic Shores in New Jersey — has already been shelved, thanks in part to the Trump administration’s decision to [claw back a previously issued Clean Air Act permit](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/zeldin-atlantic-shores-permit-epa).
A spokesman for Equinor told Canary Media, “We will not comment about the potential consequences until we know more.” He said the company is engaging directly with the Department of the Interior to “understand the questions” raised about its federal permits, which were issued in 2024.
Equinor signed its federal lease for Empire Wind during the first Trump administration in 2017. Its project took over eight years to go from proposal to full approval, though President Trump’s interior secretary, Doug Burgum, who oversees the core offshore wind permitting process, [recently suggested](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-cancels-empire-wind) in a post on X that “the Biden administration rushed through its approval without sufficient analysis.”
That leaves Sunset Park community members to wonder what’s next.
“Unfortunately, that door of what is beautifully possible and necessary is being shut on our knuckles,” wrote Yeampierre in response to Trump’s interference.
## **Defending the dream**
Offshore wind promises cleaner and more reliable energy for New York and the East Coast. But for residents of Sunset Park in particular, these projects — and the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal that relies on them — offer benefits beyond that.
What’s also at stake is a real shot to revive Sunset Park, a mainly working-class neighborhood of Asian, Latino, and immigrant communities. Equinor has already given $5 million in grants to help local community groups, like UPROSE, build education and job-training programs around a new wind-power economy.
Maintaining Sunset Park’s industrial character is key to keeping housing affordable in the area, Eddie Bautista, executive director of the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, told Canary Media in 2022. Many envision Sunset Park as a place where people have job training and good salaries without the air pollution that spewed from the port during its 20th century heyday.
“We were building a whole industry … and the problem with shutting down the project is that it really sends a signal to the developers in the market — like, what certainty is there?” said Lara Skinner, executive director of the Climate Jobs Institute at Cornell University’s New York City campus.
She fears that developers like Equinor may pull out, not for lack of commitment, but for lack of certainty that Trump will honor the federal government’s permits and approvals. And if the offshore wind turbines don’t get installed, she said, the wind hub in Sunset Park is in jeopardy.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, has expressed “fight this every step of the way.”
Meanwhile, some local Republican officials are pleased. Speaking at a press conference last week, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman “We think there [were] shortcuts. We think there was false information. And a lack of public input.”
Esposito, the organizer of Tuesday’s rally, said politics should not be part of the Empire Wind debate.
“Look, offshore wind is not a Republican issue and not a Democratic issue,” said Esposito, who noted the threats of a warming planet and rising seas. “At the end of the day, we all live on an island.”","Offshore wind, Clean energy jobs, Climate justice, Wind, Northeast, New York",trump-empire-brooklyn-jobs-terminal.md,articles_offshore-wind

The Trump administration’s latest attack on an offshore wind project could make New England’s electricity less reliable and more expensive.
Late last month, the administration [halted work](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-admin-halts-construction-of-nearly-finished-offshore-wind-farm) on the nearly complete Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, citing dubious “national security” reasons. [New England fishermen](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/fishermen-oppose-trump-revolution-halt) who voted for Donald Trump oppose the move, which is part of the president’s [monthslong assault](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/orsted-financial-struggles-trump-revolution-sunrise) on an energy source central to the Northeast’s grid and decarbonization plans.
Should Trump tank the project, it would leave a gaping hole in New England’s energy mix, driving up the region’s already-high electricity prices and leaving its grid more vulnerable to collapse during winter storms. New England’s grid operator has already factored the 704-megawatt wind farm into its plans starting next year. Delaying delivery of that power “will increase risks to reliability,” ISO New England warned in a 
That’s not to mention the longer-term disruptions that could stem from killing a project that’s followed all the rules and is already about 80% built.
“Unpredictable risks and threats to resources—regardless of technology—that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” ISO New England said in the statement.
In the measured world of grid operators, warnings like these are “unprecedented,” said Abe Silverman, an attorney, energy consultant, and research scholar at Johns Hopkins University. But so is the threat of the federal government smashing a cornerstone of a region’s energy mix, he said.
“We’re talking about a really significant hit to consumers, at a time we’re all hyper-concerned about inflation and energy prices generally,” Silverman said. Losing Revolution Wind’s electricity could cost New England consumers about $500 million a year, he estimated, based on the value the project has secured in ISO New England’s 
And “we don’t need a bunch of fancy studies to tell us that these units are needed for reliability,” he said. New England has long struggled to meet electricity demand during winter cold snaps and summer heat waves. When temperatures surpassed 100 degrees Fahrenheit for [several days in June](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/northeast-heat-wave-solar-battery-benefits), “they had every single generator on,” he said. “Here we have a unit that should be operating as of next summer that is now in doubt.” 
But it’s during the winter months that the loss of Revolution Wind could be most keenly felt, said Susan Muller, a senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. That’s when the region’s ISO New England is 
But as the move to shut down Revolution Wind shows, the Trump administration’s relentless attacks on the offshore wind industry are making the energy source harder to plan around. 
## **Keeping energy prices down and the grid up**
In the winter, “we essentially run out of pipeline gas” for the gas-fired power plants that make up New England’s largest single source of power, Muller said. The region is forced to rely on power plants fueled by 
That’s an expensive way to keep the lights on. Wholesale power costs from December to February spiked to $4 billion, up from $1.6 billion the previous winter, ISO New England reported that 67% compared to last year, driven primarily by a 112% year-over-year increase in gas prices.
Luckily, strong winter winds make offshore wind farms a great solution to these problems, Muller said — and she has the fancy studies to prove it. 
Muller consulted on a 400 million in energy costs this past winter if 3.5 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity had been online. That’s roughly the total combined capacity of Revolution, the in-progress Vineyard Wind, and two other yet-to-be-built projects, New England Wind 1 and the first phase of the SouthCoast Wind project. 
The money-saving mechanism is pretty simple, Muller explained. Offshore wind farms are costly to build, and the utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island that signed long-term contracts with Revolution Wind will be paying prices for that power that are higher than the average prices on ISO New England’s wholesale energy market. But the price is steady and not susceptible to huge swings like that of fossil gas. During wintertime peaks, it costs the same to generate power from offshore wind as it does on a mild day — the same is not true for gas.
Because of this dynamic, the Daymark Energy Advisors analysis found that Revolution Wind’s power would still save consumers money even if the utilities pay twice as much as wholesale prices, Muller said. 
Revolution Wind is also meant to supply power to ISO New England’s forward capacity market, which is designed to secure the resources the region needs to ensure its grid can keep running during times of peak demand in future years. 
The project would make it less expensive for the region to meet those peaks, Silverman said, putting New England in a better position than other areas of the country. Grid operator PJM Interconnection, which covers 13 states and D.C., has seen [capacity prices skyrocket](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-markets/pjm-rising-costs-interconnection-reform) in the past year because it has not built new generation fast enough, he noted.
Perhaps even more valuable is that offshore wind can be a buffer against fuel shortages, Muller said. “In other words, we might have enough power plants, but they might not have enough fuel to get us through,” she said. 
This summer, ISO New England LNG import and storage facility near Boston. 
But out of all those variables, the study’s base case assumes that ISO New England will have about 1.6 gigawatts of offshore wind power in 2027, including 704 megawatts from Revolution Wind. “If you take it out of the model, the risk will go up,” Muller said. 
##  **Why fossil fuels can’t fill the offshore wind gap**
Fossil fuels can’t replace the power that would be lost if Revolution Wind isn’t brought online, Muller and Silverman said — even if the Trump administration is touting more gas pipelines as a solution.
Last month, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin 
The piece came after the Trump administration [lifted a stop-work order](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/equinor-empire-trump-timeline) on New York’s Empire Wind offshore wind project in May, claiming it had struck a deal with Gov. Kathy Hochul to allow two major gas pipelines to be built in the state. Hochul, a Democrat, has “work with the administration and private entities on new energy projects that meet the legal requirements under New York law.”
Energy experts have [pointed out many flaws](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/constitution-pipeline-zeldin-energy-prices) in the administration’s push for more pipelines, including a lack of capacity to move gas from New York to New England and poor long-term economics for expanding that capacity. Every state in New England [except New Hampshire](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/new-hampshire-law-office-energy-innovation) has set clean energy and decarbonization mandates that call for using less fossil gas, not more, in the years to come.
“We know that pipelines cost billions of dollars to build,” Muller said. But while Revolution Wind will generate energy throughout the year, “a pipeline would only change things for a handful of days, a few weeks of the year. The rest of the time, it wouldn’t be needed. … There would be cheaper options.”
The Trump administration has insisted that fossil-fueled power plants must stay open to ensure grid reliability, going so far as to [use emergency powers](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/trump-extend-campbell-michigan-coal-plant) to force coal-, gas-, and oil-burning plants to [keep running](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/trump-extend-pennsylvania-eddystone-stay-open-order) past their planned retirements. Those orders will force customers to bear tens of millions of dollars or more in unnecessary costs while doing nothing to improve reliability, according to energy analysts as well as the state attorneys general and environmental groups challenging the extensions in court.
Fossil-fueled power plants also pose [reliability challenges in cold weather](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/natural-gas-is-the-pillar-of-the-us-electric-grid-its-also-unreliable). Gas plants made up the 2021, across the U.S. Southeast in 2022, and during the 2014 “polar vortex” in the U.S. Northeast.
The cold can cause malfunctions at gas plants themselves, or it can limit fuel supply by spurring breakdowns at the wellheads and compression stations that feed pipeline networks. ISO New England’s 3.9 gigawatts to 4.8 gigawatts of gas-fired power “may be at risk due to constrained natural gas pipelines.”
All of these factors were considered in the years-long decision-making processes that New England states went through to decide that offshore wind is their best choice, said Larry Chretien, executive director of the nonprofit Green Energy Consumers Alliance.
“We’re buying 30 years of power at a fixed price, and it’s a good price,” he said. “The states have decided they want to buy this stuff.” By blocking completion of Revolution Wind, the Trump administration is “forcing fossil fuels down our throats.”","Offshore wind, Energy markets, Wind, Northeast",trump-revolution-halt-disaster-new-england-grid.md,articles_offshore-wind

Gary Yerman, 75, sat nervously in a noisy ballroom in Virginia Beach, Virginia, counting down the minutes until he could shed his ill-fitting double-breasted suit for a sun shirt and blue jeans. He introduced himself as a fisherman of 50 years to a stranger seated next to him at the banquet table.
“That sounds really hard,” the other man replied.
“Not as hard as it’s going to be to go accept this award and talk to a room full of people,” joked Yerman. Moments later, his name was called, and he walked onto a professionally lit stage to accept a small crystal trophy from the Oceantic Network, a leading trade group for the burgeoning multibillion-dollar U.S. offshore wind industry.
It was an unlikely sight. America’s fishermen have long treated wind developers as their sworn enemies.
The conflict started in the early 2000s, when the first plans for New England’s offshore wind areas were sketched out. In packed town hall meetings that often devolved into shouting matches, fishermen claimed the projects would make it harder to earn a living: fewer fishing grounds, fewer fish, damaged ocean habitat.
Few of these predictions have come to pass in places like the U.K., which has already built over 50 offshore wind farms in its waters. Wind areas there are [habitat for haddock](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/fish-turbines-reef-research). But even today, fisher-led groups in the U.S. are spearheading lawsuits aiming to halt at least two offshore wind farms under construction on the East Coast. One former offshore wind executive told Canary Media that the amount of pushback from fishermen in America has made offshore wind investments riskier than in Europe.
Yerman was one of the first fishermen in the U.S. to cross this bitter divide. He’s become the reluctant face of a group of over 100 fishermen and fisherwomen who go by the name Sea Services North America. They’ve decided to work for offshore wind farms — not against them. Doing so supplements their income from scalloping, a centuries-old bedrock of the New England fishing economy that has seen revenues dry up.
Pursuing work in wind power has come at a cost. After the awards event, back in blue jeans and with a celebratory beer in hand, Yerman recounted the exact word New England fishermen used when he and his crew first crossed the Rubicon.
“They called us traitors,” he said.
Those tensions have become supercharged with the election of President Donald Trump, who has called offshore wind “““
Yerman and his crew are left wondering if the industry they’ve bet their livelihood on — and work they’ve risked their reputations for — will all come crashing down.
Many of the fishermen who work through Sea Services voted for Trump. And if the president fulfills his promise to halt the industry, it would be devastating not only for the Northeast’s climate goals and grid reliability — but for thousands of workers in the region, from electricians to welders to Sea Services’ fishermen.
One of Sea Services’ captains, Kevin Souza, put it simply: The impact would be “big time.”
## **“ Everyone was skeptical”**
Six years ago, Yerman was like the others — angry with offshore wind developers, particularly Danish giant Ørsted, which had set up shop in his hometown of New London, Connecticut.
Concerned that wind turbines might push his son out of the scalloping business, he pulled one of the only levers he could think to pull and contacted his state senator at the time, Paul Formica, a Republican who owned a local seafood restaurant.
Formica wanted to see the two sides get along. He arranged a meeting between Yerman and an Ørsted executive named Matthew Morrissey, who happened to be a native of New Bedford, Massachusetts, the most lucrative commercial fishing port in America.

Yerman found in Morrissey a sympathetic ear, and in turn, he listened to what the executive had to say — that Ørsted was open to partnering with fishermen. Morrissey had seen, with his own eyes, fishers working for and coexisting with Ørsted in a tiny port in Kilkeel, Northern Ireland. The energy firm had a team of about two dozen marine affairs employees, Morrissey relayed, who could help make something like that happen in America if Yerman was on board. He pitched it as a win-win.
“Everyone knows that fishermen hate offshore wind companies. Well, guess what? Offshore wind companies hate fishermen, too,” Morrissey, who no longer works at Ørsted, told Canary Media earlier this year. “Our goal here is to spread the understanding that these two industries can and do and will work together.”
The idea intrigued Yerman. In the U.S., profits from scalloping have fluctuated from year to year, and, following a crash in the 1990s, scallop numbers remain unpredictable. In his view, if offshore wind companies were moving into their waters — like it or not — they might as well make some money from it.
Yerman got to work.
His first call was to Gordon Videll, a longtime friend and affable small-town lawyer, who knew things about contracts that Yerman didn’t. The two flew to Kilkeel — on their own dime — to see the model for themselves. Videll noticed that some of Kilkeel’s fishermen were driving cars nicer than his. He and Yerman were inspired.
When they returned to Connecticut, Yerman recruited about a half dozen of his commercial fishing buddies, and Videll started putting together the paperwork. They dubbed themselves Sea Services North America and in 2021 landed their first small contract, with Ørsted. It was a pilot, said Morrissey, to see if this arrangement would work here in America.
“Everyone was skeptical,” recalled Morrissey with a laugh. “Because their boats were in such poor safety condition. But you know what? They pulled it off.”
Today, Sea Services operates like a co-op and has brought 22 fishing boats up to certified safety standards. With Videll at the helm as part-time CEO, the group has completed over 11 contracts in eight different wind farm areas, from Massachusetts to New Jersey. Instead of hiring ferries or work boats, developers rely on Sea Services fishermen to provide safety and scout services for offshore wind vessels.
It’s important work: making sure, for example, no fishing gear, like crab traps, is in the way of cables, monopiles, or survey operations. If necessary, Sea Services fishermen move gear — with the owner’s approval. When not cleared, these obstacles have caused days and sometimes weeks of costly delays for developers, according to Morrissey.
Sea Services was an “indispensable partner” in helping to build South Fork Wind, [which went online last year](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/wind/the-first-big-us-offshore-wind-farm-is-open-heres-whats-next) and became America’s first large-scale offshore wind project, wrote Ed LeBlanc, a current Ørsted executive, in an email to Canary Media. The firm has since contracted the group for other projects, in no small part because of their expertise about local waters, he added.
Cooperation between these two sides — offshore wind and commercial fishing — does exist elsewhere in America. For example, Avangrid and Vineyard Offshore, the codevelopers of the Vineyard Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts, have 
But Sea Services is unique. Today the group offers an expansive network of 22 partner vessels based in six states and is led by a commercial fisherman. Videll brought on new technology, allowing developers to track their work in real time. He said they adopted a co-op model to maximize the amount of money going into participants’ pockets.
Receiving the Oceantic Network award in late April was a big deal for the collective, said Videll. It’s an example of how successful the venture has been in a short period of time — and, more importantly, it should be good for business. Industry awards mean visibility. More visibility could mean more Sea Services contracts.

But, right now, the Sea Services business faces headwinds that no award can help overcome.
Since taking office in January, President Trump has launched an all-out assault on the offshore wind industry. On his first day in office, he [halted new lease and permitting activity](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/scare-tactics-and-uncertainty-what-trumps-offshore-wind-order-means) and called for a review of the nine projects that already had their federal permits in hand. In March, his Environmental Protection Agency chief [revoked a key permit for Atlantic Shores](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/zeldin-atlantic-shores-permit-epa), a fully permitted project that 
The most eyebrow-raising step came in April, when Trump’s Interior Department [issued a stop-work order](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/equinor-empire-trump-timeline) for Empire Wind 1, two weeks after the project [had begun at-sea construction](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/empire-wind-construction-trump).
It was a wake-up call for Sea Services, which works for Norwegian energy giant Equinor on the project. Videll, Sea Services’ CEO, said at the time that the cessation of Empire Wind would be a crushing blow that could cost the co-op a total of $9 million to $12 million worth of work.
In May, the administration suddenly lifted the stop-work order. Sea Services’ contract was safe, at least for the time being. But it was the most bracing illustration yet that the business, in spite of all its success, now faces very choppy waters under the Trump administration.
## **Taking a risk**
On a cloudless late-February day at the New Bedford port, 57-year-old Souza hovered over a checklist and laptop in the captain’s quarters of the Pamela Ann. Souza is the captain of the boat, and he needed to make sure everything was in order before he and his crew left New Bedford that afternoon. They’d be at sea for 10 days, working in many of the spots Souza had fished in for decades.
Those 10 days at sea would not be spent dredging up scallops from the seafloor and tallying their catch, however, but conducting safety operations for the Revolution Wind offshore wind project, which is being built off the coast of Rhode Island and Massachusetts.
The hulking scalloping boat, with its ebony-painted hull and wood-paneled interior, was bustling ahead of the journey. In the galley, Souza’s 25-year-old son, one of the three mates onboard, sorted through the food they’d need. Jack Morris, a 73-year-old scalloper and Sea Services manager, paced around the Pamela Ann checking in on its recently updated safety assets, like a new tracking beacon and safety suits.
Trips like these have become a lifeline for Souza, his crew, and an increasing number of fishermen who depend on the struggling scalloping industry.
Today, there are roughly 350 vessels sitting in ports from Maine to North Carolina that have licenses to harvest sea scallops. For several decades, East Coast scallopers managed to eke out a comfortable middle-class lifestyle on scalloping alone. Morris said that “years ago” he’d pull in $200,000 to $300,000 of profit annually as a scallop boat captain.
“Yeah, those days are gone,” scoffed Morris.
While the price of scallops remains high, making it one of the most lucrative U.S. fisheries, 30 years have restricted when and where scallopers can harvest, resulting in fewer days at sea, fewer scallops caught — and less money for the entire industry.
Souza has mixed emotions about the regulations.
On the one hand, scallops are no longer being overfished. A 2024 “meets the requirements for a well-managed and sustainable fishery.” In fact, for over a decade, U.S. sea scallops sold on grocery store shelves have carried a little blue-check label — the mark of a seafood certified by the Marine Stewardship Council.
But most scallop fishermen are now limited to an extremely short window of time during which they can harvest scallops— in 2025, it was just 24 days. Some of their favorite fishing grounds are regularly closed for scallop recovery. There are simply fewer scallops to go around. Souza estimates that captains who stick to scalloping alone are making half of what they did in years past: “They’re probably lucky to make a hundred [thousand].”
Offshore wind work has helped fishermen like Souza and Morris ease the sting of that lost income.
Across Revolution Wind’s two-year construction window, Souza expects to make over $200,000 as a part-time boat captain. For the younger generation, who Souza said as deckhands can expect to make only around $30,000 per year from scalloping, offshore wind work makes it possible to keep earning a middle-class wage.
In the past year, Souza has recruited to Sea Services both of his sons, his nephew, and a few other young folks from longtime fishing families who might have otherwise left the scallop industry if not for the supplemental income.
“This wind farm business is the number one way for scallop guys, captains, mates, deckhands, to make extra money,” said Morris.
It’s also helping to revitalize the port of New Bedford, a city of 100,000 that is not only the most valuable fishing port in America but also a place of tremendous historic importance to the industry. It was once the epicenter of the whaling world and serves as the backdrop for the opening scenes of Herman Melville’s “Moby Dick.”
In just 10 years, the offshore wind industry has ushered in a transformation the city hadn’t seen “since the whaling era,” according to Jon Mitchell, the city’s mayor since 2011.
The companies building Vineyard Wind now stage their offshore wind infrastructure in New Bedford. Their presence has brought a flood of public and private funding to the city, with over $1.2 billion already invested and pledged to help give the terminals, docks, and harbor a facelift, according to Mitchell.
For all the money offshore wind has brought to the city — and into the pockets of locals like Souza and Morris — offshore wind remains highly controversial among many commercial fishermen in New Bedford.
That’s in spite of Mitchell’s insistence that, when push comes to shove, New Bedford’s local government will always side with scalloping.
Still, Mitchell, one of New England’s fiercest offshore wind defenders, remains unpopular with many down at the boat docks. “I’ve put myself in the loneliest place in American politics, which is right in the middle. Between offshore wind and commercial fishing,” he said.
## **Trump flags, full pockets**
The fishermen who take part in Sea Services also float in that lonely place.
It’s not uncommon for them to face harassment from other fishermen over the radio when out on the water, Yerman said. One time, he said a Sea Services fisherman was turned away from a Rhode Island dock, in what Yerman characterized as an act of revenge.
The hardest part of Yerman’s job is overcoming this cultural aversion and getting fishermen to the table, convincing them that working for the offshore wind developers is a way to sustain a livelihood whose viability has begun to fade.
“You’ll have the lobster guys and they’ll say shit to you — like, ‘traitor.’ Or ‘Trump’s gonna shut that down, ha ha ha,’” Souza said, imitating the taunts he receives over the marine radio bolted to the wall near the helm of the Pamela Ann.
The lobstermen have a point regarding Trump. As frustrating as their remarks may be, the biggest threat to offshore wind is not snipes from colleagues, but the actions of a president who many Sea Services members — including Souza — voted for.

As Souza prepared to leave the New Bedford port in February to go help Ørsted build giant wind turbines in the ocean, something Trump swore would not happen during his term, he explained his support for the president.
“Trust me, I want Trump to ‘drill, drill, drill.’ I’m all for it,” said Souza of the president’s plans to expand oil and gas production.
But he still thinks offshore wind is necessary to get more power onto New England’s grid and lower energy costs. Experts say that the federal permitting process for offshore wind in America takes too long — about four years. But, in the Northeast region, according to energy analyst Christian Roselund, finishing the deployment of the offshore wind projects already in the permitting pipeline will be much faster than starting up new nuclear or fossil-gas power plants.
“Once we ‘drill, drill, drill,’ you’re still gonna need more electricity,” Souza said. “Where are you gonna get it? My electric bill at my house is stupid high!”
Most of the fishermen in New Bedford are Trump supporters, he insisted. Morris, who also voted for Trump, agreed. Overall, Trump won 46% of the city’s votes in last November’s election — a much higher proportion than his Massachusetts 36.5%. The “TRUMP 2024” flags flown from the dozens of scallop boats docked across New Bedford’s port underscored the point. A few of those Trump flag-flying boats even work for the offshore wind companies, Morris claims. The Pamela Ann _,_ for its part, does not have a Trump flag.
“I support Trump even though I know he’s against wind. … I believe this will still be around,” said Souza, gesturing toward the ocean, where somewhere over the horizon an array of wind towers was being erected. “He’s gonna see the light.”
Trump, of course, has not seen the light — though he did revoke his stop-work order against Empire Wind.
After being grounded for a month, Sea Services fishermen began operations on Empire Wind again in early June, when the project resumed at-sea work. The co-op’s members are helping Equinor’s construction vessels lay boulders on the seafloor to stabilize all 54 wind towers that will be raised over the next two years and eventually supply much-needed carbon-free power to New York City.
But nothing is certain. When the Trump administration unpaused the project, it left open the door to stopping it again — or killing it altogether. A May letter from the Interior Department to Equinor noted that it is still conducting an “ongoing review” to determine if the project’s permits were “rushed” and therefore illegitimate in the eyes of the Trump administration.
Meanwhile, a coalition of a dozen fishing companies and several anti-offshore wind groups typically allied with Trump 
In his opposition to offshore wind, Trump has positioned himself as a defender of the commercial fishing industry, 2024 campaign rally in Wildwood, New Jersey, for example, that the turbines “cause tremendous problems with the fish and the whales.”
But for the increasing number of fishermen working with offshore wind companies, halting the industry would not help — it would crush a financial lifeline.
Not long ago, in 2017, Sea Services captain Rodney Avila remembers being one of the only fishers in New Bedford willing to seize this lifeline. He recalled with a laugh what a long-time fisherman friend said to him then: “When you put that first wind turbine up there … we’re going to hang you from it!”
Times have changed. In the New Bedford area, almost 50 local fishing vessels have performed some kind of safety or scouting work for Vineyard Wind. At least one captain lowers his MAGA-supporting flag before setting out to work on the projects the president has sworn to stop, according to Avila. He said politics has always been tangled up in fishing. And work is work.
“They don’t care whether it’s red, or blue, or whatever color. … They don’t care,” Avila shrugged, while sipping coffee inside a Dunkin’. Five scalloping boats bobbed on calm water just beyond the parking lot. “It’s money that they need to support their families, wherever it comes from.”

The move echoes an April order from the Interior Department that stopped all offshore work on New York’s Empire Wind project. 
Last time, the controversial pause lasted just one month but cost the developer [nearly $1 billion](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/orsted-financial-struggles-trump-revolution-sunrise) — and drove the project to the [brink of cancellation](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/empire-equinor-interior-review-halt).

The purpose given for Friday’s stop-work order — “national security interests” — has long-time wind industry insiders scratching their heads. 
“There were no major military issues that came to the fore in New England,” said wind energy veteran Bill White in an interview with Canary Media. From 2009 to 2015, White represented Massachusetts on 
“Was the military at the table, represented and consulted with during this stakeholder process? The answer is: very much so,” said White, who for much of his time on the task force worked for the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center as senior director of offshore wind sector development.
White — who went on to oversee offshore wind as CEO of Avangrid Offshore, one of the developers of Massachusetts’ embattled Vineyard Wind project — said he’s aware of national security issues that have been raised about proposed offshore wind projects near Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina, which have coastlines dotted with large military installations. 
In April 2023, for example, the Pentagon “highly problematic.” But the Pentagon has not raised those kinds of high-level concerns over Revolution Wind — or any of the projects being built in New England’s waters, according to White. The Pentagon did not return a request for comment.
Development of the Revolution Wind project began more than a decade ago. In 2013, Deepwater Wind New England LLC won a federal auction for two leases in the wind energy area designated by the intergovernmental task force; Ørsted later acquired those leases when it bought the company. From 2016 to 2020, the Danish firm assessed the site and continued to engage stakeholders, like local fishermen, according to BOEM records. 
Between 2020 and 2023, Revolution Wind endured an extensive regulatory review, including from the Pentagon and the Federal Aviation Administration. Since wind turbines have the potential to affect air-traffic radar and aviation navigation, the FAA conducted an airspace analysis. The agency ultimately approved the project under the condition that all turbines be built to lighting and marking standards that would ensure they’re visible to aircraft at night.
In August 2023, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers co-signed the authorization of plans for Ørsted to build 65 wind turbines for the Revolution Wind project. The National Marine Fisheries Service, a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, also signed the authorization. 
During Revolution Wind’s long road to construction, it had strong support from neighboring states, which have made ambitious renewable energy commitments in recent years. 
“The Trump administration’s stop-work order on Revolution Wind undermines efforts to expand our energy supply, lower costs for families and businesses, and strengthen regional reliability,” said Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee, a Democrat, in a statement. 
“will pursue every avenue to reverse the decision to halt work on Revolution Wind.” Lamont, in “political move.” 
This new fight between the two governors and the feds could play out similarly to [the fight between New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and the Trump administration](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/equinor-empire-trump-timeline) over the Empire Wind project earlier this year. After weeks of developer Equinor threatening to walk away from the halted project due to the high costs of delayed construction, the Trump administration reversed course and lifted the ban, claiming it had struck a deal with Hochul, a Democrat, to allow a natural gas pipeline to be built in the state. 
On the day the Interior Department lifted the order, Secretary Doug Burgum thanked Hochul “willingness to move forward on critical pipeline capacity.” But a representative for Hochul’s office told Canary Media at the time that “no deal on any natural gas pipeline was reached.”
The Trump administration, including U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, has in recent months [pushed](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/constitution-pipeline-zeldin-energy-prices) for New England and in particular Massachusetts to build new gas pipelines. 
McKee and Lamont — or perhaps Ørsted — could also opt for litigation, a route not taken by Hochul or Equinor during the Empire Wind drama. 
The Trump administration’s stop-work order comes as Ørsted is [seeking to raise](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/orsted-financial-struggles-trump-revolution-sunrise) billions of dollars from its shareholders to help complete Revolution Wind and its other fully permitted U.S. project, Sunrise Wind, after other financing options fell through. 
In the earnings call announcing the fundraising effort earlier this month, Ørsted blamed its financial troubles on “unexpected developments outside our control.” Now the European firm is reeling from yet another unexpected blow from the Trump administration.

On June 30, after an exhausting round of late-night negotiations, Delaware state legislators passed a bill to effectively green-light the Southeast’s second offshore wind farm. Within days, lawmakers in Washington passed legislation that may doom its future.

When President Donald Trump [signed the “Big, Beautiful Bill”](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/senates-big-beautiful-bill-would-be-a-disaster-for-clean-energy) on Friday, he dramatically shortened the window in which offshore wind projects can qualify for tax credits that offset up to 30% of their costs. The law now requires new wind farms be “placed in service” by the end of 2027 or begin construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify.
“We don’t predict any new offshore wind projects starting construction … at least in the next four years,” Sholler told Canary Media two days before Congress passed the bill.
He described Republicans’ tightening of the tax credit — from an original deadline to start construction by 2033 or potentially later, to this one-year sprint — as the final nail in the coffin for offshore wind farms that are fully approved but not currently underway. Two projects — MarWin near Maryland and New England Wind off the Massachusetts coastline — float in this gray zone, and are now vulnerable to being put on ice indefinitely.
Wind developers have faced mounting hurdles in recent months: [new tariffs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/trump-tariffs-clean-energy-industry), a [federal permitting pause](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/scare-tactics-and-uncertainty-what-trumps-offshore-wind-order-means), higher investment risk, and the looming threat of the Trump administration halting already-approved projects, like it did in a shocking [monthlong pause on New York’s Empire Wind](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/equinor-empire-trump-timeline).
A BloombergNEF report released in April states that losing the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, known as and , would be “devastating” for U.S. projects already in the pipeline. Analysts estimate that the electricity produced by offshore wind farms that qualify for the credits costs on average 24% less over a project’s lifetime.
That April report predicted “all but the most advanced projects [will] pause development activities.” Now, with tax credits officially rolled back, prospects for offshore wind appear even more dim.
“If you take away the tax credits, it doesn’t make much sense to develop an entirely new sector,” said Elizabeth Wilson, a professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College who studies offshore wind policy.
America’s offshore wind sector is still in its infancy. While the U.K. has already built over 50 wind farms in its waters, America has only completed [one large-scale project](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/wind/the-first-big-us-offshore-wind-farm-is-open-heres-whats-next): South Fork Wind, located off the coast of Long Island, New York.
Trump issued an executive order on Inauguration Day that froze all offshore wind permitting and leasing pending a federal review. Seemingly safe from the president’s ire at the time were eight projects, including MarWin, that already had all their federal permits in hand. Since then, at least one of those permitted projects — the[ 2.8-gigawatt Atlantic Shores project off the New Jersey coast](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/nj-has-given-up-on-offshore-wind-for-now-whos-to-blame) — has fallen apart. Five are currently under construction.
The largest offshore wind project now being built in America — Dominion Energy’s 2.6-gigawatt Virginia project — appears unscathed by the Inflation Reduction Act rollback.
“There is no impact to Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind. The project is nearly 60 percent complete and is on schedule to be completed in late 2026,” wrote Jeremy Slayton, a spokesperson for Dominion Energy, in an email to Canary Media, dispelling concerns that the 176-turbine project off the Virginia coastline would suffer from the scaleback of tax credit eligibility.
The existing tax credits Dominion expects to secure “will result in substantial savings for our customers,” he added.
Dominion has so far spent approximately [$6 billion on this monumental project](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/dominion-virginia-construction-trump). Some in the industry feared that the impact of Trump’s reconciliation bill could have been far worse, and are celebrating that the five wind farms under construction might see full operation.
“While this fight is over, I’m incredibly proud of Oceantic’s members and staff,” said Liz Burdock, president and CEO of the offshore wind industry group, in a July 3 statement after Congress passed the bill. “Because of their relentless push, developers now have one year to start construction and retain 100% of their tax credits, with a simple ‘safe harbor’ option.” (On Monday, Trump issued “safe harbor” and “beginning of construction” options.)
But for Maryland and Delaware state lawmakers who backed MarWin in the face of considerable county-level pushback in recent months, the “Big, Beautiful Bill” is a major blow. The project’s turbines were slated for installation off Maryland’s coastline but its cables would come ashore in Delaware, making it a much-anticipated joint investment.
On June 30, Delaware’s Democratic lawmakers passed a bill that strips Sussex County officials of their ability to revoke local permits for certain aspects of the wind project. A county-level block on an onshore substation was MarWin’s final hurdle and clearing it meant construction on the substation could, in theory, begin as early as February of next year.
“This bill helps eliminate unlawful and unnecessary hurdles to a project that will help ensure electric reliability for Delawareans while lowering the price they pay for electricity,” Nancy Sopko, a spokesperson for MarWin developer US Wind, told Canary Media via email.
But whether US Wind can lock in financing and officially break ground by July 2026 — the new deadline for tax credit eligibility — is another story. US Wind is suing the Sussex County Council over the permit denial in hopes of starting earlier, before the new state law goes into effect.
Before signing the final bill, Delaware’s Gov. Matt Meyer (D) said it is important to get the offshore wind energy project “done quickly and safely to provide sustainable power to Delaware.” Within days, however, MarWin had potentially been rendered incapable — at least in the view of analysts — of taking advantage of the tax credits that would make its construction financially possible.","Offshore wind, Policy regulation, Wind, Northeast, Delaware",trump-tax-credits-marwin-delaware.md,articles_offshore-wind

Including Empire Wind, there are five offshore wind projects under construction in the U.S. and nine that have received all of the necessary permits to start building. The developers of those projects already faced a difficult political environment, but this week’s order cranks up the risk and uncertainty even further. The effects could spill over well beyond the world of offshore wind, according to CEO of Oceantic Network.
“Stopping work on the fully federally permitted Empire Wind 1 offshore project should send chills across all industries investing in and holding contracts with the United States government. Preventing a permitted and financed energy project from moving forward sends a loud and clear message to all businesses — beyond those in the offshore wind industry — that their investment in the U.S. is not safe.”

Since 2021, the Sierra Club has been grading U.S. utilities on their commitment to a clean-energy transition. While most utilities have not earned high marks on the group’s annual scorecards, as a whole they had been showing some progress. 
That’s over now. The latest edition of the Sierra Club’s “F” for the first time. 
With only a handful of rare exceptions, U.S. utilities have shed the gains they made during the Biden administration. Almost none are on track to switch from fossil fuels to carbon-free energy at the speed and scale needed to combat the worst harms of climate change. 
“It’s very disappointing to find we’re at a lower score than in the first year,” said Cara Fogler, managing senior analyst at the Sierra Club, who coauthored the report. But it’s not entirely unexpected. 
Utilities had already begun slipping on their carbon commitments last year, in the face of soaring demand for electricity, [according to the 2024 “Dirty Truth” report](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/booming-power-demand-is-undermining-us-utility-climate-progress), largely in response to the boom in data centers being used to power tech giants’ AI goals. But the anti-renewables, pro–fossil fuels agenda of the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress has pushed that reversal into overdrive. 
“We have a new federal administration that’s doing everything in their power to send utilities in a direction away from cleaner power,” Fogler said. “They’re doing away with everything in the Inflation Reduction Act that supported clean energy. They’re straight-up challenging clean energy, as we’ve seen with Revolution Wind,” the New England offshore wind farm that’s [now under a stop-work order](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-admin-halts-construction-of-nearly-finished-offshore-wind-farm). “And they’re doing everything in their power to keep fossil fuels online” — for example, through Department of Energy actions that [force coal, oil, and gas plants to keep running](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/forcing-dirty-power-plants-to-stay-open-would-cost-americans-billions) even after their owners and regulators had agreed on retirement dates. 
But utilities also bear responsibility for not doing more to embrace technologies that offer both cleaner and cheaper power, Fogler said. “From a cost perspective, from a health perspective, from a pollution perspective, there are so many reasons to build more clean energy and fewer fossil fuels. Unfortunately, we’re seeing that utilities are much less concerned about doing the right thing for the climate and their customers.” 
##  **What’s the score?**
For its new “The Dirty Truth” report, the Sierra Club analyzed 75 of the nation’s largest utilities, which together own more than half the country’s coal and fossil-gas generation capacity. The report measures utilities’ plans against three benchmarks: whether they intend to close all remaining coal-fired power plants by 2030, whether they intend to build new gas plants, and how much clean-energy capacity they intend to build by 2035. 
As of mid-2025, the utilities had plans to build only enough solar and wind capacity to cover 32% of what’s forecast to be needed by 2035 to replace fossil-fuel generation and satisfy new demand. While 65% of the utilities have increased their clean-energy deployment plans since 2021, 31% have reduced them. 
Meanwhile, commitments to reduce reliance on fossil fuels have taken a big step backward as utilities have turned to keeping old coal plants running and are planning to build more gas plants to meet growing demand. As of mid-2025, the utilities had plans to close only 29% of coal generation capacity by 2030, down from 30% last year and 35% in 2023. 
And the amount of gas-fired generation capacity the utilities plan to build by 2035 spiked to 118 gigawatts as of mid-2025. That’s up from 93 gigawatts in 2024, and more than twice the 51 gigawatts planned in 2021. 
Major utilities have dramatically expanded the amount of fossil-gas power plant capacity they plan to build. (Sierra Club)
That expanding appetite for new gas-fired power has been supercharged by the [surge in forecasted electricity demand](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/data-centers-are-driving-us-power-demand-to-hard-to-reach-heights) across much of the country — [data centers](https://www.canarymedia.com/boon-or-bane-what-will-data-centers-do-to-the-grid) are the primary driver of that growth. But much of that expected data-center demand is [speculative](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/utilities-are-flying-blind-on-data-center-demand-thats-a-big-problem). And the lion’s share of it is premised on the idea that the hundreds of billions of dollars in AI investments from tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft as well as AI leaders like OpenAI and Anthropic will end up earning those companies enough money to pay off their costs — 
The Sierra Club is among a growing number of groups demanding that [utilities and regulators proceed with caution](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/how-to-build-data-centers-without-raising-grid-costs-and-emissions) in building power plants to serve data centers that may never materialize. Forecasted data-center power demand is already driving up utility rates for everyday customers in some parts of the country, and the new gas power plants now in utility plans aren’t even built yet. 
“There is some load we’re naturally going to see — there’s population growth, lots of beneficial electrification we want to see happen,” said Noah Ver Beek, senior energy campaigns analyst at the Sierra Club and another coauthor of the report. “But we also want utilities to be realistic about load-growth projections.” 
Unfortunately, booming demand growth gives utilities “more cover” to invest in polluting assets, Fogler said. Utilities earn guaranteed profits on the money they spend building power plants and grid infrastructure, which gives them an incentive to avoid questioning high-growth forecasts or seeking out lower-cost or less-polluting alternatives. 
Some of the most aggressive fossil fuel expansions are planned for the Midwest and Southeast, including by [Dominion Energy in Virginia](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/virginia-dominion-chesterfield-gas-data-center-demand), [Duke Energy in North Carolina](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/north-carolina-duke-plans-data-center-demand), and [Georgia Power](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/georgia-power-plan-gas-expansion).
Even the handful of utilities that have previously earned high marks for clean-energy and coal-closure commitments in past “Dirty Truth” reports have slipped. Fogler highlighted the example of Indiana utility NIPSCO, which earned an “A” in the past four reports but only a “B” in the latest, largely due to its plan to rely on gas power plants to meet expected data-center demand. 
NIPSCO has “no plans to pursue the high-load-growth scenario until they see contracts signed and progress made,” Fogler said — a prudent approach that avoids burdening customers with the costs of new power plants built for data centers that may never come online, she said. “The problem? Their high-load-growth scenario calls for all new gas. There should be more clean options.” 
Most utilities are not capitalizing on the solar and wind tax credits that are set to disappear in mid-2026 under the [megalaw](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/senates-big-beautiful-bill-would-be-a-disaster-for-clean-energy) passed by Republicans in Congress this summer, she said. Only a handful of utilities, such as Xcel Energy in [Colorado](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/colorado-speed-wind-solar-tax-credits) and “We want more utilities to take that period of certainty and speed up what they’ve already planned.” 
Going big on clean energy is also the only way to quickly add enough generation capacity to meet growing demand forecasts and contain rising utility costs, Ver Beek noted. Utilities and major tech companies are [pinning their near-term capacity expansion plans](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/will-the-ai-boom-be-powered-by-big-slow-energy-projects) on new gas plants, despite the

https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/google-ai-data-center-flexibility-help-grid,Google’s new plan to keep its data centers from stressing the grid,28 August 2025,Jeff St. John,"AI data centers are set to swamp U.S. power grids. Google’s new utility deals aim to flip the script — shifting workloads to ease strain and speed its access to energy. 
A Google data center in The Dalles, Oregon, where the company has experimented with shifting power use to relieve pressure on the grid. (
AI data centers could flood the overtaxed U.S. power grid with demand and further [drive up energy costs for consumers](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/data-centers-are-overwhelming-the-grid-could-they-help-it-instead). Or, they could simply agree to use [less electricity during the handful of hours per year](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/one-way-data-centers-can-help-the-grid-by-being-flexible) when the grid is under the greatest stress, making it possible for tech companies to get the power they need without straining the system.
It sounds like an easy fix, but in reality it’s complicated to modulate the demand of a data center that can use as much power as a small city. That’s why it’s rarely done today. In fact, a “identified no examples of grid-aware flexible operation at data centers” in the U.S., with one exception — Google.
Now, the tech giant is taking its flexibility efforts one step further and applying the concept to the machine learning operations that underpin its large language models, the technology driving the current boom in AI development.
This month, Michael Terrell, Google’s head of advanced energy, M) and Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), two utilities facing a lot of data center demand, that “represent the first time we’re delivering data center demand response by targeting machine learning workloads.”
Google’s new announcements are a really big deal, said Tyler Norris, a Duke University doctoral fellow and former solar developer and special adviser at the Department of Energy. That’s because they’re the first example of the kind of collaboration between data centers and utilities that needs to happen to keep costs from spiraling out of control.
Estimates of power demand from the AI race [are all over the map and hard to trust](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/utilities-are-flying-blind-on-data-center-demand-thats-a-big-problem), but at a minimum, most experts agree that data center demand for electricity outstrips supply. Consumer advocates and state lawmakers are increasingly worried that this dynamic is going to cause electricity rates to surge, as utilities incur the costs of building the power plants and grid infrastructure to serve data centers, and potentially push those costs onto customer bills.
That supply-demand imbalance is also a problem for firms like Google and its competitors, which are locked in a multibillion-dollar race to build the best possible AI system — a heated competition in which who gets electrons first could be a deciding factor.
Over the past five years or so, through its “
Until recently, it hadn’t messed with power demand for machine learning. This sort of flexibility is new territory for utilities and grid operators, too: It’s not standard practice to allow large customers to come online only if they agree to curtail their power use, Norris pointed out.
“We’ve never planned loads this way, essentially for the entire history of the electric utility industry,” Norris said. But without this kind of approach, “it’s effectively impossible to see how some of these load forecasts can be met with purely physical infrastructure building.”
Flexible data centers like Google’s may have a significant advantage in getting those all-important electrons in the near term. A more rigid project may have to wait years to come online as grid infrastructure and power plants are built; a flexible data center, meanwhile, could be fast-tracked for interconnection using the grid capacity that’s already available.
The solution has its limitations, Terrell told Canary Media in an interview, but where it makes sense, it can be a powerful tool.
“We can’t do it everywhere. Some of our loads can’t be curtailed,” Terrell said. But where Google is able to do it, “there’s value to being able to secure capacity without having to wait for new infrastructure.”
## **The massive potential of shifting when data centers use power**
The grid is crowded — but there’s plenty of room for data centers that can be flexible. That’s what Norris and a team of researchers at Duke University concluded in a February 
The analysis found nearly 100 gigawatts of existing capacity on U.S. grids for data centers that can commit to 0.5% “annual average load curtailment.” That equates to being able to curtail less than half of their total power use for about two hours at a time during peak demand events that happen about 100 hours of the year. 
There’s a simple explanation for this spare space: Grids and power plants are overbuilt to meet peak demands, or “worst-case conditions,” as Norris put it. But if data centers agree to avoid using power during those moments, it can obviate the need to expand the grid further to serve new, higher peaks.
It’s not a new idea in principle. Utilities have paid customers to reduce power use during peak demand for decades. But existing “demand response” programs tap current customers to help prevent emergencies for the grid as it is built today, Norris explained.
Google’s new deals with IM and TVA, by contrast, are aimed at managing growing demand “in the form of a definitive long-term contract the utility can use for planning purposes,” he said. In other words, instead of using demand response to manage existing power needs, the utilities and Google are now wielding this approach to allow new users to come online. “That’s what sets it apart.”
Norris isn’t aware of any other data center-utility projects that are taking this longer-term planning view. In fact, “most data center developers won’t even release the nameplate megawatt scale of the facility,” he said — a feature of the highly competitive AI race.
In part because of this secrecy, it’s unclear how data center growth will play out in the real world. Most projections are [based on speculative requests](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/utilities-are-flying-blind-on-data-center-demand-thats-a-big-problem) from developers seeking power in multiple locations for projects that may or may not end up being built.
But forecasts of data center growth generally indicate that they’re set to overwhelm the grid.
A December report from consultancy Grid Strategies found that five-year growth forecasts for U.S. utilities and grid operators have [quintupled between 2022 and 2024](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/data-centers-are-driving-us-power-demand-to-hard-to-reach-heights), with data center hot spots such as Virginia, Georgia, Texas, and swaths of the Midwest particularly impacted. The past month has seen utilities in 
That’s going to drive up utility rates, [which are already rising](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/electricity-prices-rising-trump-impact) due to a number of factors, including expensive investments in grid maintenance and expansion. While it can take time for the costs of accommodating new data centers to arrive on customers’ utility bills, the sheer scale of that expansion means that “the affordability concerns here are being put into stark focus,” Norris said.
Those future costs are starting to pile up.
Georgia Power won regulatory approval earlier this year to move ahead with plans for a controversial and unprecedentedly rapid [buildout of power plants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/georgia-power-plan-gas-expansion), almost entirely based on huge, uncertain forecasts of data center growth. The company has filed a more than [investment in fossil-fueled power](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/dominion-virginia-clean-power-law) to serve the world’s highest concentration of data centers. And Louisiana regulators last week 10 billion data center from Meta. 
In some states, customers are already paying more for energy because of data centers. PJM Interconnection, the grid operator serving Washington, D.C., and 13 states from Illinois to Virginia, has seen [prices for capacity](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-markets/pjm-rising-costs-interconnection-reform) to maintain its grid skyrocket in the past year. PJM’s inability to bring new generation online is a chief culprit. But its ballooning future demand, another important part of the equation, is “almost entirely due to existing and projected data center load additions,” according to PJM’s 
Norris argued that utilities, regulators, and grid operators must start demanding that would-be data centers commit to some level of flexibility to receive grid interconnection. “If you’re planning for all new loads to be inflexible and serving them with firm at all hours of the year, that’s going to be extraordinarily expensive,” he said.
While data centers could build their own power supplies, “we also don’t want them to be running the backup [diesel generators] 200 hours a year to get online faster,” Norris said. Reliance on 
Google’s approach of managing its data center power use to reduce carbon emissions represents a much cleaner alternative. “The capabilities we developed to do load shifting for carbon, we use the same capabilities to do demand response,” Terrell said.
## **The details of Google’s data center flexibility commitments**
Google’s agreement with TVA applies to existing data centers “north of Nashville and in North Alabama. We need to grow, but [TVA was] not in a position to serve us” in the short term, Terrell said. TVA has not released details of its agreement with Google, and Terrell declined to provide more specifics.
Google’s agreement with IM centers on the tech giant’s 
In broad terms, the M to help it meet its capacity requirements. “We need to be bringing new resources onto the system,” Terrell said.

More such rules are coming. Ohio regulators in July 14 Midwest and Great Plains states, plans 
Data center operators have traditionally shied away from altering operations to save or shift energy, said Astrid Atkinson, CEO of [grid-software startup Camus Energy](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/camus-energy-grid-software-for-little-utilities-with-big-clean-energy-ambitions). That makes sense, given the high value of the computing they’re doing — something Atkinson dealt with as former lead of the Google teams that maintain reliable computing at data centers providing web services and social media.
But data centers training AI models have more flexibility than those providing time-sensitive or business-critical services like processing financial transactions, she said. “They’ll be running large training jobs that use up a lot of their nameplate capacity for a period of time, but then they may sit idle for a long period of time,” she said. “You can potentially move them around in time a little bit.”
Camus Energy is already [working on projects](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/how-to-make-evs-get-along-with-the-grid) to enable [flexible EV charging](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/a-new-way-to-fix-grid-bottlenecks-for-ev-charging-flexible-connection), but much of its recent work with utilities centers on managing new data centers, she said. “If it makes the difference in being able to build or expand a site now, or having to wait five years, that makes it worth doing.”
Indeed, some other utilities and data center operators are exploring grid flexibility. The Electric Power Research Institute, a largely utility-funded nonprofit, last year launched its 
And although most regulated utilities lack incentives to work on flexible interconnection — they earn guaranteed profits based on how much money they spend on grids and new power plants — Norris thinks the surge in demand could change their calculus. There’s only so much cost regulated utilities can put on their customers before regulators are forced to intervene, and the AI boom is testing those limits.
“The more they’re looking at big upgrades and infrastructure investments, the more they need to balance that with affordability,” Norris said.
Terrell said that Google is “having more conversations with utilities” about data center flexibility, though he declined to provide further details. “It’s an advantage for our business to be able to go to utilities and offer this.”","Utilities, Policy regulation, Transmission",google-ai-data-center-flexibility-help-grid.md,articles_utilities

Virginia regulators sent mixed signals on the state’s clean energy transition this week — accepting utility Dominion Energy’s plan for new fossil-fueled plants on one hand but ordering the company’s future blueprints to better account for [the state’s carbon-free electricity law](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/dominion-virginia-clean-power-law) on the other.
Dominion’s forecast represents its strategy for meeting electricity demand over 15 years and doesn’t lock the company into building specific power plants — a nuance the State Corporation Commission was careful to note in its 
“This order rightfully notices a lot of problems with Dominion’s planning process and is rightfully requiring them to fix it,” said Nate Benforado, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. “The real question is: What’s going to happen in the meantime? We certainly shouldn’t be relying on a flawed plan when billions of customer dollars are at stake.”
Benforado and other advocates had urged the State Corporation Commission to reject Dominion’s plan outright, OK’d the resource plan with only faint praise, calling it merely “legally sufficient” and directing Dominion to change its approach for its next forecast, due October 2026.
The accepted plan stops six years shy of 2045, the year by which Dominion is supposed to generate 100% carbon-free electricity, according to the 2020 Virginia Clean Economy Act. The road map does not address how the utility expects to meet the decarbonization requirement.
In light of what Benforado and other advocates called this “fundamental flaw,” the commission ordered future schemes to span 20 years — not 15 — and include at least one scenario where all fossil-fueled plants are shuttered by the law’s deadline.
“Year after year, Dominion files plans that ignore clean energy requirements, lock in expensive fossil-fuel infrastructure, and drive up electric bills,” Dyanna Jaye, deputy director of strategy and governance at nonprofit Clean Virginia, said in a statement. “By recognizing the harm this process can cause to Virginia families and businesses, the Commission has taken a step in the right direction by calling for significant reforms moving forward.”
Regulators also directed Dominion’s future plans to include additional battery storage, discuss [grid-enhancing technologies](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/north-carolina-duke-grid-technology), and aim to shave more power demand through energy-efficiency measures. The commission called the utility’s proposal to achieve 2.73% energy savings by 2028 “the low end of feasible,” and said a 5% target would be more reasonable.
“Dominion’s long-term plan should serve Virginia customers — not stand in the way of progress,” Shawn Kelly, Virginia-based regulatory director at industry group Advanced Energy United, said in a statement. “The [proposal] needs to reflect the law, plan for a reliable clean energy future, and make use of proven tools like energy efficiency and storage to meet customer needs affordably.”
Though they didn’t call out the proposed 944-megawatt gas complex in Chesterfield County by name, regulators stressed that they will still debate Dominion’s plans for it and 
“Acceptance does not express approval … of the magnitude or specifics of Dominion’s future spending plans, the costs of which will significantly impact millions of residential and business customers in the monthly bills they must pay for power,” the order says.
The commission “quite clearly” signaled it wouldn’t be rubber-stamping new plant permits, said Benforado. But how the panel plans to treat the modeling underlying the Chesterfield proposal, which mirrors that of the long-term plan, is murkier. “There’s just a lot of question marks there,” he said.
Other disappointments for proponents of clean energy: The panel accepted Dominion’s self-imposed limits on new solar farms, which advocates say are far too low. Plus, neither the utility nor its regulators made mention of environmental justice, though the public health toll of burning fossil fuels is possible to quantify.
“Our estimates put those health impacts in the range of $7 [billion] to $13 billion,” Benforado said. “We urged the commission to direct the company to really analyze health impacts, and it just wasn’t addressed in the order.”
Asked for a reaction to the ruling, Dominion spokesperson Aaron Ruby emphasized that the company is building the country’s [largest offshore wind project](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/dominion-virginia-construction-trump), and that it faces the biggest growth in power demand since World War II.
“We appreciate the Commission’s thorough review, and we’ll of course follow the additional requirements in future [plans],” Ruby said. “Most of our new power comes from carbon-free sources like offshore wind and solar. We also need natural gas in the mix because renewables are not always available.”","Utilities, Fossil fuels, Policy regulation, Southeast, Virginia",virginia-dominion-longterm-plan-approved.md,articles_utilities

**Rural energy funding in turmoil**
For over two decades, the Rural Energy for America Program, or REAP, has helped farmers and rural businesses save on energy costs, ranging from installing solar panels to buying more efficient grain dryers. The program has given out billions of dollars in grants and loans in its lifetime, and was infused with another $2 billion by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 — but now the Trump administration has cast uncertainty over the future of REAP, [Kari Lydersen reports for Canary Media](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/usda-solar-rural-grants-uncertainty).
After taking office in January, Trump froze over $1 billion in REAP funds. Then, on July 1, the USDA abruptly canceled a grant application window for the program. The administration has also explicitly said it wants the program to deemphasize its most popular function: helping farmers afford solar. Farmers are concerned about the upheaval with the popular program, which, [as Kari reports in a second story](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/trump-rural-grants-midwest-republican-impact), largely benefits Republican congressional districts.
**Consumers could lose big as Trump pushes fossil fuels**

Last week, Trump’s Energy Department released a report that experts say relies on flawed math to bolster the case for keeping old coal-fired power plants online past their planned closure dates. Experts fear the administration will use this report to justify additional orders like the two Trump has already made. If that happens, [Jeff reports in a second story](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/cost-trump-keep-coal-open) that it would be disastrous for Americans, potentially costing them billions of dollars in extra energy costs all to prop up expensive, polluting energy infrastructure that the grid doesn’t need.

Known as the data center capital of the world, Virginia offers a crucial test case for electric utilities: Can they meet power demand from the explosion of AI while keeping bills affordable and slashing carbon emissions?
Many experts fear that Dominion Energy, Virginia’s largest utility, is failing that test.
In July, the company [won approval](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/virginia-dominion-longterm-plan-approved) from state regulators for its plan to construct a raft of new fossil-fueled plants over the next 15 years — despite a Virginia law that discourages such plants and requires them to phase out completely by 2045.
Now, Dominion is asking the same regulators for permission to build the first of those facilities: a 944-megawatt “peaker” complex that would operate only when demand is at its highest. The utility says the four-unit “reliability center” in Chesterfield County, just outside Richmond, is the best way to meet a surge in electricity needs and warrants an exception to the state’s decarbonization law.
But in a flurry of paper filings over the last month, clean energy advocates and industry groups disagreed — acknowledging a growing demand for power but maintaining that Dominion ignored a range of alternatives in order to justify the new gas complex. Even the nonpartisan expert staff for the regulatory body, the State Corporation Commission, criticized Dominion’s rationale for the permit.
No one is denying that there is some load growth, and we will need new resources,” Peter Anderson, energy policy director for advocacy group Appalachian Voices, said in a But there is no justification for backtracking on clean energy progress and saddling communities with new polluting plants.”
## **“ Unacceptable threats to reliability”?**
Virginia has fast become ground zero for data centers — immense buildings that house computers and related hardware that power AI chatbots and other software that’s now part of everyday life. The state is already home to 95.
Just last week, Google announced 5% annual rise in peak electricity use over the next 15 years. And while some critics question the specifics, they accept the overall trajectory of growth.
But the demand surge is testing the limits of the 2020
Dominion nodded to the law in its “does not require that the Commission take any action which, in its determination, ‘threatens the reliability or security of electric service to the utility’s customers.’”
The new gas complex is the only cost-effective solution, according to the utility. Without it, the company said in its filing, “unacceptable threats to reliability” will ensue.
## **“ They biased the entire process”**
But in written testimony filed with regulators in recent weeks, multiple experts rejected Dominion’s conclusions on both reliability and cost-effectiveness.
Many said a “cold snap analysis,” which Dominion relied on to show that the gas complex would be crucial during extreme cold weather, was unpersuasive. Dominion could easily avoid power shortages by using fully charged batteries and suspending exports to Duke Energy customers in North Carolina, consultants for Appalachian Voices and other nonprofits testified. By correcting these and other assumptions, “all identified energy violations are resolvable without constructing Chesterfield,” Ryan Deyoe, a power markets specialist at analytics firm Telos Energy, 
Critics also took aim at a study by The Brattle Group, which modeled a reliability scenario with and without Dominion’s proposed gas project. “The finding that the system is less reliable when a resource is removed and not replaced with anything is not helpful or meaningful,” Devi Glick, a senior principal at Synapse Energy Economics, 
To address reliability, Dominion should try to comply with a mandate of reducing electricity sales 5% by 2028 compared to 2019 levels, Glick wrote. Instead, the company plans to reduce sales by less than 3%. “By omitting incremental energy efficiency from its modeling,” she said, “Dominion is ignoring the reliability impacts of increased investment in energy efficiency.”

Plus, she pointed to the potential for load flexibility for large customers, a still-nascent but promising approach whereby behemoths like Google [agree to use less electricity](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/google-ai-data-center-flexibility-help-grid?amp%3Butm_medium=email&%3Butm_campaign=canary&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9IGN8-YjG9HI9-AloVSkkBpTlZB-SHRAbd0f3XhKCFdPux35CHy2UUPTuAqWoFX075850T66x9JDkwnx9nhRFtHcjGZmuElS-eckTBARMhN5yCQFU&_hsmi=377990038&utm_source=newsletter) during the handful of hours a year when the grid is under the greatest stress.
Detractors poked holes in Dominion’s economic analysis, arguing it unnecessarily restricted these alternatives. For the Sierra Club, Glick developed a carbon-free portfolio that would cost about the same as the gas complex, without the downsides of pollution and the volatile price of fossil fuels that would be borne by customers.
Shawn Kelly, Virginia-based regulatory director for Advanced Energy United, says the flaws in Dominion’s application stem from the utility’s desire to build the Chesterfield complex no matter what. The company, he said in his “predetermined outcome to build a gas plant and then to support their decision, they biased the entire process so that they could select their proposal.”
## **“ A difficult position”**
The State Corporation Commission’s expert staff, which recently filed its own 
The staff — whose opinion is highly valued by commissioners — questioned the cold snap analysis, as well as the Brattle study. “Neither of the analyses presented by the Company show that [the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center] is unquestionably the best choice of generation unit needed to meet a projected resource deficiency,” staff analyst Steven Smith said in his testimony.
The company’s economic study was also underwhelming, he wrote. “It is clear the construction of new natural gas resources is not a dramatically positive impact to jobs or the economy within the Commonwealth specifically based on the Company’s economic impact analysis.”
Staff lamented Dominion’s failure to develop other, potentially cleaner energy resources in the years leading up to its permit application for the Chesterfield complex.
“The limited options available to the Company for alternative dispatchable resources, the long timeline required to build them, and the Company’s timing and decisions have placed the Commission in a difficult position relative to adjudicating this [permit] application,” Smith testified.
And yet, despite all those misgivings, staff did not oppose approval of the Chesterfield project, suggesting Dominion had left regulators little choice in the face of rising electricity demand.
Delaying construction of the plant or considering new alternatives, Smith argued, “has the potential to leave the Company substantially resource deficient and reliant on the currently volatile spot market,” in which the utility can buy power from elsewhere in the region.
Still, the staff’s opinion is not the final word. Dominion’s written responses to critics were due this week. 16, and an in-person expert witness hearing in the quasi-judicial proceeding is scheduled for late September. There’s no timeline for regulators to rule.
“The decision is in the commission’s hands after they hear the rest of the evidence,” Kelly told Canary Media. “But it is really important to home in on what the staff pointed out as flaws, including: They’re not convinced that this Chesterfield solution is the best solution. That’s scary when you’re talking about spending billions of dollars of ratepayer money.”","Utilities, Fossil fuels, Policy regulation",virginia-dominion-chesterfield-gas-data-center-demand.md,articles_utilities

Dominion Energy’s latest plan to meet power demand in the coming years ignores Virginia’s carbon-free electricity deadline and should be rejected by state regulators, say clean energy advocates.
A 2020 state law requires Dominion Energy to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. Yet the utility’s latest long-range forecast and generation plan looks only at the next 15 years, when it still envisions burning fossil fuels.
“In terms of utility planning, this 2045 legal requirement is one of the most important resource planning requirements — if not the most important,” the Southern Environmental Law Center wrote in a “Dominion, however, failed to account for this legal requirement in its modeling in any way.”
A ruling from the State Corporation Commission, which regulates Virginia’s utilities, is due July 15, and it has denied the company’s plans before. Though its decision won’t lock Dominion into building specific power plants, it will set the stage for another action that could: The panel is currently weighing whether to permit the utility’s controversial “resource request” to build a 944-megawatt gas complex in Chesterfield County, just southwest of Richmond.
“What the Commission accepts in a [long-range plan] has a direct bearing on subsequent resource requests,” the law center said in its filing on behalf of environmental nonprofit Appalachian Voices. “If the Commission accepts poor modeling … the Company will recycle that poor modeling for its next resource request.”
## **Dominion Energy “didn’t take the assignment seriously”**
Like 
The commission 2018, noting among other problems that Dominion hadn’t analyzed the most cost-effective ways to meet demand.
Then, in 2020, lawmakers adopted the 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045, leading to two more denials of Dominion’s plans 
“It’s not unreasonable to ask a monopoly utility to produce a plan that complies with state law and upholds simple principles of justice and fairness,” Connor Kish, director of the Sierra Club’s Virginia chapter, said in a statement after the 2024 ruling. “Dominion didn’t take that assignment seriously.”
The utility’s previous plan encompassed a 15-year “planning” period as well as a 25-year “study” period that extended past 2045, when the Virginia Clean Economy Act kicks into full gear. The pending Dominion plan is more egregious, critics argue, because it includes only the planning period that ends in 2039. There is no study period.
“You have to let the model see that there’s a 2045 carbon-free requirement in Virginia,” said Peter Anderson, Charlottesville-based director of state energy policy with Appalachian Voices. “That’s takeaway No. 1.”
The limited time horizon scrambles the economics underlying the utility’s modeling. Though state law requires a combined-cycle gas plant built in 2037 to shutter eight years later, Dominion assumes such a facility will be paid off over 36 years. Such assumptions distort the cost-effectiveness of new gas infrastructure and produce a false picture of what’s best for consumers, advocates say.
In all, Dominion 2036. The law would allow some of these plants to run past 2045, but only if regulators determine they’re critical for reliability.
“The reliability exemption or exception hasn’t been tested yet,” noted Anderson, “so the presumption under the law today is [that Dominion is] going to close [its] carbon-emitting units by 2045 at the latest.”
The commission’s staff testified in April that without the reliability exception, “it is unclear how [Dominion’s] plans could possibly be in the customers’ best interest.”
Beyond the costs of building the plants, there’s also the price of fuel to consider, said Nate Benforado, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center in Charlottesville.
“If we build all this gas, we are risking customer dollars. We are tying Virginia to this global gas commodity,” he said. Prices are on the rise and fluctuate with world events outside the state’s control, like [Russia’s invasion of Ukraine](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/ukraine-russia-war-europe-clean-energy-transition). “We’re going to have higher bills, unpredictable bills,” he said.
## **Skewed model undervalues clean energy, critics say**
Dominion Energy did not respond to a request for comment. But advocates say the company perverts its modeling output in other ways, imposing annual limits of 350 megawatts of battery storage starting in 2028 and 1,030 megawatts of solar starting in 2029.
“All of these choices tend to skew Dominion’s model to pick gas and avoid these very cost-effective, very efficient systems,” Benforado said.
By contrast, [virtual power plants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants) than Dominion now plans, along with new nuclear generation, could meet ballooning energy demand that wasn’t foreseen when the Clean Economy Act first became law.
“We were genuinely curious whether we could meet the carbon-free deadlines since the advent of ChatGPT and the AI race as a main driver of increased electricity demand,” Anderson said. “This is just a totally different conversation than what people were talking about in 2020 when electricity demand was flat.”
## **On the horizon: Data centers and a new gas plant**
Though Dominion serves the largest data center market in the world, advocates also caution that its projected 5.5% annual growth in demand may well be inflated.
“The Company relies on a speculative and highly uncertain load forecast driven almost entirely by one industry, and in large part by just a few companies,” the Southern Environmental Law Center said in its filing.
At the same time, Dominion is falling far behind the law’s requirement that it shave demand with energy-efficiency programs, says Advanced Energy United, a national clean-energy industry association. The Clean Economy Act obligates the utility to trim 5% off demand by this year, compared to 2019 levels. It hasn’t and 
“Dominion overlooked a lot of clean energy solutions in their modeling — meaning energy efficiency, demand response, and virtual power plants,” said Shawn Kelly, regulatory director for Advanced Energy United. “That resulted in them exaggerating a need for supply-side resources” that generate electricity for the grid.
Given the track record of the State Corporation Commission, advocates have some cause for hope that it will once again reject Dominion’s plan. If it does, the decision won’t bind the utility to build a particular solar or wind farm or abandon plans for a gas facility. But it could force the company to look past 2039 and incorporate what it sees into permit applications.
No matter what the panel does in July, the reality remains that its previous rebuffs didn’t stop Dominion from 
Kelly doesn’t discount the importance of the long-range plan, and he and his organization, like other advocates, believe the commission should deny it. But he also pointed to the gas plant proposal on the table as an urgent concern.

Google’s new utility deals aim to flip the script — shifting workloads to ease strain and speed its access to energy. 
A Google data center in The Dalles, Oregon, where the company has experimented with shifting power use to relieve pressure on the grid. (
AI data centers could flood the overtaxed U.S. power grid with demand and further [drive up energy costs for consumers](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/data-centers-are-overwhelming-the-grid-could-they-help-it-instead). Or, they could simply agree to use [less electricity during the handful of hours per year](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/one-way-data-centers-can-help-the-grid-by-being-flexible) when the grid is under the greatest stress, making it possible for tech companies to get the power they need without straining the system.
It sounds like an easy fix, but in reality it’s complicated to modulate the demand of a data center that can use as much power as a small city. That’s why it’s rarely done today. In fact, a “identified no examples of grid-aware flexible operation at data centers” in the U.S., with one exception — Google.
Now, the tech giant is taking its flexibility efforts one step further and applying the concept to the machine learning operations that underpin its large language models, the technology driving the current boom in AI development.
This month, Michael Terrell, Google’s head of advanced energy, M) and Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), two utilities facing a lot of data center demand, that “represent the first time we’re delivering data center demand response by targeting machine learning workloads.”
Google’s new announcements are a really big deal, said Tyler Norris, a Duke University doctoral fellow and former solar developer and special adviser at the Department of Energy. That’s because they’re the first example of the kind of collaboration between data centers and utilities that needs to happen to keep costs from spiraling out of control.
Estimates of power demand from the AI race [are all over the map and hard to trust](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/utilities-are-flying-blind-on-data-center-demand-thats-a-big-problem), but at a minimum, most experts agree that data center demand for electricity outstrips supply. Consumer advocates and state lawmakers are increasingly worried that this dynamic is going to cause electricity rates to surge, as utilities incur the costs of building the power plants and grid infrastructure to serve data centers, and potentially push those costs onto customer bills.
That supply-demand imbalance is also a problem for firms like Google and its competitors, which are locked in a multibillion-dollar race to build the best possible AI system — a heated competition in which who gets electrons first could be a deciding factor.
Over the past five years or so, through its “
Until recently, it hadn’t messed with power demand for machine learning. This sort of flexibility is new territory for utilities and grid operators, too: It’s not standard practice to allow large customers to come online only if they agree to curtail their power use, Norris pointed out.
“We’ve never planned loads this way, essentially for the entire history of the electric utility industry,” Norris said. But without this kind of approach, “it’s effectively impossible to see how some of these load forecasts can be met with purely physical infrastructure building.”
Flexible data centers like Google’s may have a significant advantage in getting those all-important electrons in the near term. A more rigid project may have to wait years to come online as grid infrastructure and power plants are built; a flexible data center, meanwhile, could be fast-tracked for interconnection using the grid capacity that’s already available.
The solution has its limitations, Terrell told Canary Media in an interview, but where it makes sense, it can be a powerful tool.
“We can’t do it everywhere. Some of our loads can’t be curtailed,” Terrell said. But where Google is able to do it, “there’s value to being able to secure capacity without having to wait for new infrastructure.”
## **The massive potential of shifting when data centers use power**
The grid is crowded — but there’s plenty of room for data centers that can be flexible. That’s what Norris and a team of researchers at Duke University concluded in a February 
The analysis found nearly 100 gigawatts of existing capacity on U.S. grids for data centers that can commit to 0.5% “annual average load curtailment.” That equates to being able to curtail less than half of their total power use for about two hours at a time during peak demand events that happen about 100 hours of the year. 
There’s a simple explanation for this spare space: Grids and power plants are overbuilt to meet peak demands, or “worst-case conditions,” as Norris put it. But if data centers agree to avoid using power during those moments, it can obviate the need to expand the grid further to serve new, higher peaks.
It’s not a new idea in principle. Utilities have paid customers to reduce power use during peak demand for decades. But existing “demand response” programs tap current customers to help prevent emergencies for the grid as it is built today, Norris explained.
Google’s new deals with IM and TVA, by contrast, are aimed at managing growing demand “in the form of a definitive long-term contract the utility can use for planning purposes,” he said. In other words, instead of using demand response to manage existing power needs, the utilities and Google are now wielding this approach to allow new users to come online. “That’s what sets it apart.”
Norris isn’t aware of any other data center-utility projects that are taking this longer-term planning view. In fact, “most data center developers won’t even release the nameplate megawatt scale of the facility,” he said — a feature of the highly competitive AI race.
In part because of this secrecy, it’s unclear how data center growth will play out in the real world. Most projections are [based on speculative requests](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/utilities-are-flying-blind-on-data-center-demand-thats-a-big-problem) from developers seeking power in multiple locations for projects that may or may not end up being built.
But forecasts of data center growth generally indicate that they’re set to overwhelm the grid.
A December report from consultancy Grid Strategies found that five-year growth forecasts for U.S. utilities and grid operators have [quintupled between 2022 and 2024](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/data-centers-are-driving-us-power-demand-to-hard-to-reach-heights), with data center hot spots such as Virginia, Georgia, Texas, and swaths of the Midwest particularly impacted. The past month has seen utilities in 
That’s going to drive up utility rates, [which are already rising](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/electricity-prices-rising-trump-impact) due to a number of factors, including expensive investments in grid maintenance and expansion. While it can take time for the costs of accommodating new data centers to arrive on customers’ utility bills, the sheer scale of that expansion means that “the affordability concerns here are being put into stark focus,” Norris said.
Those future costs are starting to pile up.
Georgia Power won regulatory approval earlier this year to move ahead with plans for a controversial and unprecedentedly rapid [buildout of power plants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/georgia-power-plan-gas-expansion), almost entirely based on huge, uncertain forecasts of data center growth. The company has filed a more than [investment in fossil-fueled power](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/dominion-virginia-clean-power-law) to serve the world’s highest concentration of data centers. And Louisiana regulators last week 10 billion data center from Meta. 
In some states, customers are already paying more for energy because of data centers. PJM Interconnection, the grid operator serving Washington, D.C., and 13 states from Illinois to Virginia, has seen [prices for capacity](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-markets/pjm-rising-costs-interconnection-reform) to maintain its grid skyrocket in the past year. PJM’s inability to bring new generation online is a chief culprit. But its ballooning future demand, another important part of the equation, is “almost entirely due to existing and projected data center load additions,” according to PJM’s 
Norris argued that utilities, regulators, and grid operators must start demanding that would-be data centers commit to some level of flexibility to receive grid interconnection. “If you’re planning for all new loads to be inflexible and serving them with firm at all hours of the year, that’s going to be extraordinarily expensive,” he said.
While data centers could build their own power supplies, “we also don’t want them to be running the backup [diesel generators] 200 hours a year to get online faster,” Norris said. Reliance on 
Google’s approach of managing its data center power use to reduce carbon emissions represents a much cleaner alternative. “The capabilities we developed to do load shifting for carbon, we use the same capabilities to do demand response,” Terrell said.
## **The details of Google’s data center flexibility commitments**
Google’s agreement with TVA applies to existing data centers “north of Nashville and in North Alabama. We need to grow, but [TVA was] not in a position to serve us” in the short term, Terrell said. TVA has not released details of its agreement with Google, and Terrell declined to provide more specifics.
Google’s agreement with IM centers on the tech giant’s 
In broad terms, the M to help it meet its capacity requirements. “We need to be bringing new resources onto the system,” Terrell said.

Data center operators have traditionally shied away from altering operations to save or shift energy, said Astrid Atkinson, CEO of [grid-software startup Camus Energy](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/camus-energy-grid-software-for-little-utilities-with-big-clean-energy-ambitions). That makes sense, given the high value of the computing they’re doing — something Atkinson dealt with as former lead of the Google teams that maintain reliable computing at data centers providing web services and social media.
But data centers training AI models have more flexibility than those providing time-sensitive or business-critical services like processing financial transactions, she said. “They’ll be running large training jobs that use up a lot of their nameplate capacity for a period of time, but then they may sit idle for a long period of time,” she said. “You can potentially move them around in time a little bit.”
Camus Energy is already [working on projects](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/how-to-make-evs-get-along-with-the-grid) to enable [flexible EV charging](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/a-new-way-to-fix-grid-bottlenecks-for-ev-charging-flexible-connection), but much of its recent work with utilities centers on managing new data centers, she said. “If it makes the difference in being able to build or expand a site now, or having to wait five years, that makes it worth doing.”
Indeed, some other utilities and data center operators are exploring grid flexibility. The Electric Power Research Institute, a largely utility-funded nonprofit, last year launched its 
And although most regulated utilities lack incentives to work on flexible interconnection — they earn guaranteed profits based on how much money they spend on grids and new power plants — Norris thinks the surge in demand could change their calculus. There’s only so much cost regulated utilities can put on their customers before regulators are forced to intervene, and the AI boom is testing those limits.
“The more they’re looking at big upgrades and infrastructure investments, the more they need to balance that with affordability,” Norris said.
Terrell said that Google is “having more conversations with utilities” about data center flexibility, though he declined to provide further details. “It’s an advantage for our business to be able to go to utilities and offer this.”","Utilities, Policy regulation, Transmission",google-ai-data-center-flexibility-help-grid_1.md,articles_utilities

In small communities across North Carolina, data centers are already sparking conflict over land use, water use, and quality of life. Now, the debate over the facilities’ voracious need for electricity — and whether it can be met with clean sources — is heating up in the state capital of Raleigh.
For months, North Carolina’s predominant utility, Duke Energy, has forecast ballooning demand from large customers like data centers: immense buildings that house the computing devices powering AI and other software that’s become part of everyday life.
Early last year, Duke projected these “large loads” would need an additional 3.9 gigawatts of capacity, equal to about four nuclear power plants and enough to serve millions of households. By May of this year, the company’s prediction had swelled to almost 6 gigawatts.
The eye-popping estimates helped lead regulators to [approve Duke’s current plan](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/regulators-ok-duke-energys-gas-plant-buildout-despite-n-c-climate-law) to build a massive new fleet of gas plants, alongside some clean energy investments, despite a state law requiring the utility to decarbonize. The projections are certain to factor into the 
The forecasts have “thrown everything out of whack,” said Nick Jimenez, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.
That’s why his organization asked the state’s Utilities Commission to 
In June, the Utilities Commission 14.
It’s not clear if the process will culminate in a discrete order from the commission, or simply inform the myriad other Duke cases before it. But Jimenez praised regulators for being proactive. “You need a proceeding to get your arms around some of these issues,” he said. “I think that’s really smart and forward-looking.”
## **The data center boom**
In the race against other states to attract economic development, Duke and North Carolina officials keep confidential exactly which entities hope to draw power from the electric grid. And [skeptics question](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/utilities-are-flying-blind-on-data-center-demand-thats-a-big-problem) whether all of the new facilities behind predictions of unprecedented demand growth will pan out.
But there’s little doubt that data centers are on the rise, propelled by the AI explosion. Researchers say they could account for 44% of U.S. load growth by 2028, and there’s ample evidence that North Carolina is following the national trend.
In June, 10 billion, 800-acre computing campus in Richmond County, east of Charlotte, billed as the largest single capital project in North Carolina history. To the west of Charlotte, the development of a “500 billion U.S. expansion plans, and Microsoft envisions four new data centers nearby. Google is considering growing its facility in neighboring Caldwell County.
Not all communities are welcoming data centers with open arms. The town council of tiny Tarboro, an hour east of Raleigh, just voted to “digital campus” that would displace 190 acres of farmland.
Still, early this month, Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat and former attorney general, “AI Accelerator” and a council designed to make the state “a national leader in AI literacy, governance, and deployment to the benefit of our residents, communities, and economy.”
Stein did note the technology’s downsides, including “the uncertainty around AI systems and their associated energy and water needs.” But his edict also reflects the seeming common wisdom of the moment: AI and its requisite facilities are multiplying and expanding, bringing economic opportunities that can outweigh their challenges.
## **“ We can come to the table”**
In the open docket before regulators, experts say that with the right policies in place, clean energy, efficiency, and related strategies can meet the moment. “We can come to the table,” said John Burns, general counsel for Carolinas Clean Energy Business Association, a trade group representing developers, manufacturers, and others in the clean energy industry.
In “load flexibility,” a form of demand response in which data centers curtail their electricity use when the grid is strained by lots of energy consumption.
Load flexibility is feasible because data centers don’t run at maximum capacity 24/7, said Tyler Norris, former special adviser at the U.S. Department of Energy and a doctoral fellow at Duke University, which has no connection to the utility.
“You never actually run the chips and the servers to 100% of their rated nameplate power,” he said. “You wouldn’t want to, because they overheat and they don’t perform as well when they’re running that hard.”
Norris is the lead author of a 4.1 gigawatts of load if data centers shave just 0.5% off their peak usage annually. In a simple example, the facilities could operate at half their maximum capacity for 88 hours over the course of a year.
A load-flexibility arrangement between Duke Energy and data centers could, in theory, avert the construction of several gigawatts of new gas plant capacity and expensive and time-consuming transmission upgrades.
Last month, [Google announced demand-response agreements](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/google-ai-data-center-flexibility-help-grid) with the utilities Indiana Michigan Power and the Tennessee Valley Authority. In “first documented case where AI data center flexibility is explicitly integrated into U.S. utility planning.”
That’s why he hopes North Carolina regulators will study other means of incorporating curtailment, perhaps starting with voluntary measures, into Duke’s long-term plans.
“I think we need more creative thinking, and dialogue, and analysis around this kind of flexibility opportunity,” Norris told Canary Media. “It just has such substantial implications for affordability and reliability.”
## **Clean, cheap, quick**
Even if Norris’ calculations bear out, Duke Energy’s projections show it will need hundreds more megawatts of power capacity in the next decade for large loads alone. And for AI data centers, the quicker the better: In Virginia, the world’s data center capital, construction of the facilities 
That’s where utility-scale solar and storage could be especially useful, said Burns. “Not only are the resources of our members clean,” he added, “they’re also less expensive and quicker to market.”
A June “remain the most cost-effective forms of new-build energy generation on an unsubsidized basis.”
By contrast, Lazard says, “the cost of building a new combined cycle gas turbine has reached a 10-year high. Turbine shortages, rising costs, and long delivery times are expected to continue driving steep [levelized cost of energy] increases for gas technologies in the near term.”
The North Carolina Department of Commerce has adopted Gov. Stein’s “all-of-the-above energy deployment approach,” said Jennifer Mundt, the agency’s assistant secretary for energy and infrastructure. But renewables align with the department’s economic development mission because nearly half of all Fortune 500 companies aim to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, Mundt wrote in her “Companies are prioritizing sites with access to diverse energy sources,” she noted, as well as those with affordable, reliable electricity.
Especially after the legislature [repealed a key target](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/emissions-reduction/north-carolina-ditch-duke-goal-now-what?amp%3Butm_medium=email&%3Butm_campaign=canary&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-97d7GPfC6zQy9jkKwU3Mb_jtQ21Y0VUY6cDuwEef4ABmc6s24-D9_ZT_OGueWo0KtRrIKgvQ3TtGMveH6KZjMLu3IsDQ&_hsmi=377605495&utm_source=newsletter) for emissions reductions this summer, many tech giants now have more aggressive clean energy goals than the state. 2040. Google aims to power its data centers with 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.
“Google leadership remains firmly committed to this goal,” the company said in its “making it critical that we are able to identify viable pathways to supporting new carbon-free energy resources as we continue to grow our business.”
## **A best-case scenario for the clean energy transition?**
In their comments to regulators, experts highlight a range of policies that would help data center growth align with — rather than contravene — the clean energy transition.
A voluntary “clean transition tariff,” for instance, would allow data centers to pay for new renewables to come online, rather than just [chip in for carbon-free energy](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/north-carolina-approves-duke-energys-controversial-green-tariff-plan) already in the works. In Nevada, 115 megawatts of around-the-clock geothermal power to supply the company’s data centers.
North Carolina regulators could consider inducements for so-called “energy parks,” where data centers and other large loads would be clustered around their new energy sources, reducing interconnection delays and the need for transmission upgrades. The on-site energy generation could increase the resilience of the grid as a whole, serving as backup power for the utility.
Indeed, “virtual” or “distributed” power plants, whereby utilities can access non-centralized energy resources during times of need, could help avoid the construction of new power plants, 
The practice is already being tested elsewhere in the U.S. 
For Jimenez of the Southern Environmental Law Center, the best-case scenario is that the regulators adopt these and other policies “the large load that comes to the state pays for its own clean generation, and the rest of us don’t pay excessive bills.”
The worst-case scenario, he said, “would be to do nothing.”
Of course, doing nothing is a distinct possibility. Like all investor-owned, monopoly utilities, Duke is financially motivated to invest in as many capital assets as possible, to be paid back with interest by captive customers. Though it was overridden, the utility opposed the Southern Environmental Law Center’s original request for a technical conference.
In “no need to rush into major changes” or “any paradigm shift.” It pointedly argued against reforms that might take place outside a general rate case or the long-term planning process. It acknowledged the risk of building new power plants that may not be used fully by large loads, but asserted that existing regulatory processes and other factors assure that in the short-term, “there is more than ample protection against investment in generation assets that are not needed.”
What’s more, it bodes ill that last year’s much-vaunted agreement between Duke and data center giants to [develop a clean transition tariff](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/duke-energy-wants-to-help-big-tech-buy-the-24-7-clean-energy-it-needs) in the Carolinas appears to have fizzled: Despite promises otherwise, the utility has yet to request such a tariff.
But Duke’s September comments did offer a few rays of hope for advocates. Load flexibility, it suggested, is no panacea, but the company acknowledged that “well-structured flexible operations can provide benefits for customers.”
On virtual power plants, the company said it is “open to all ideas that could provide benefits to the system as a whole and are compliant with applicable law. … Creative engagement around such ideas is essential.”
Meanwhile, the commission’s perspective may be in flux. Unlike the panel that opened the docket in June, a majority of the body’s members are now appointed by Republicans, and it has elected a new chair. How regulators engage in this debate will become clearer when experts gather in October.","Utilities, Policy regulation, Southeast, North Carolina",north-carolina-duke-plans-data-center-demand.md,articles_utilities
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/georgia-power-plan-gas-expansion,Is Georgia Power quietly planning a massive buildout of fossil gas?,23 April 2025,Jeff St. John,"Watchdog groups and tech giants want more clean energy. But some fear the utility is pursuing a big fossil-gas expansion plan outside of public scrutiny instead.

Georgia Power, which expects a boom in power demand from data centers, says it needs to get a lot more electricity online — fast.
So what kind of power plants does the utility intend to rely on to accomplish this? It’s refusing to say, raising concerns that the state’s largest utility is trying to avoid public scrutiny of plans to build huge amounts of expensive, unnecessary, and polluting fossil-fueled infrastructure.
Georgia Power 
But the integrated resource plan (IRP) also has few details about the mix of energy sources the utility wants to draw on to supply the new electricity generation it 2031. Georgia Power puts that amount at 9.5 gigawatts, which is equal to nearly half of its total current generation capacity. This means stakeholders don’t know to what extent the utility plans to build new fossil-gas power plants versus clean energy and batteries.
That worries environmental and consumer advocates as well as trade groups representing the tech giants whose data center plans are driving Georgia Power’s electricity needs to begin with. For years, these groups have been pressing Georgia Power and the state Public Service Commission to [prioritize clean energy, batteries, and other alternatives](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/data-centers-want-clean-electricity-can-georgia-power-deliver-it) to fossil-fueled power plants.
Now, they fear Georgia Power’s secretive IRP process may allow the utility to rush through approval of a gas-heavy plan. By keeping its intentions to itself until the last possible moment, Georgia Power is giving the public little time to digest proposals and respond with economic or environmental counterarguments.
It also puts the state’s utility regulators in a bind. The utility says it needs to start building these new power plants ASAP or else grid reliability will suffer. That sense of urgency may give regulators little choice but to approve Georgia Power’s plans as-is.
“It’s very confusing, and it’s very concerning for us to be planning a future of growth without knowing how we’re going to meet it,” said Jennifer Whitfield, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, one of several groups demanding more information on Georgia Power’s plans. “And that’s the position we’re in until we know more.”
## **Georgia Power’s missing gigawatts**
Whitfield brought up the issue at a Public Service Commission hearing last month. Georgia Power’s IRP has identified only 517 megawatts of projects, she pointed out. The utility is seeking out the remaining roughly 9 GW of resources needed by 2031 through an “all-source RFP,” or request for proposals. The process is separate from the IRP — and shrouded in confidentiality.
That’s a problem, Whitfield said at the hearing, because “the size and type of facilities” that a utility expects to own or operate over the next 10 years. Yet, in Georgia Power’s current IRP, “95% of the need to fill capacity in Georgia in 2031 is not made available,” she said. “How are we supposed to effectively intervene to judge the economic mix without additional information?”
Jeffrey Grubb, Georgia Power’s director of resource planning, replied at the hearing that those details are, “by commission rule, not publicly available because that could have detrimental impacts on the RFP itself.”
Whitfield argued that Georgia Power should at least disclose what portion of the roughly 9 GW of unidentified resources might consist of fossil gas–fired power plants built by the utility, as opposed to clean power, batteries, or resources built and owned by third-party developers.
Grubb declined to provide that information. “We cannot speak about those because we’re still working on them,” he said.
But Georgia Power is already working on at least one large expansion of fossil-fueled power. In March, the utility applied for state permits to build four gas-fired turbines with a combined generation capacity of about 2.9 GW at the site of the utility’s coal-fired Plant Bowen.
Grubb conceded in the hearing that the utility sought those permits in preparation for possibly building the gas-fired units, which aren’t mentioned in Georgia Power’s IRP.
“We’re not sure if we’ll need all four of those,” he said. “There’s other things that we’re looking at, but I can’t speak more than they are potential resources from that RFP, and that’s why we had to move forward” with filing the permits.
Whitfield asked the Public Service Commission to require Georgia Power to provide more information on the projects being considered in its RFP, including details on fuel type, ownership, and size. Last week, in response to that request, Whitfield received the following document from the utility, which contains nothing but two columns of the word “redacted.”
Image of document provided to the Southern Environmental Law Center by Georgia Power.
“It’s difficult to understand any justification for redacting this information,” said Bob Sherrier, a staff attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. “How can the public meaningfully engage with Georgia Power’s proposed data center plans without any insight into what’s coming?”
Georgia Power spokesperson Jacob Hawkins told Canary Media in an April 18 email that the utility follows “established processes and legal requirements when submitting sensitive or proprietary information that, if made available broadly and publicly, could hurt our ability to negotiate and procure the best value and resources for our customers. Intervenors who sign confidentiality agreements as part of the process have access to much greater and detailed information.”
“We would disagree in the strongest possible terms that we are not following all statutory requirements and state law across the board in these proceedings, period,” Hawkins wrote. 
## **Regulatory blind spots**
Many states allow utilities to withhold details about the cost or type of resources in all-source RFPs to avoid undermining the competitive bidding process. But what’s uncommon about Georgia Power’s current case is just how much of its future will be dictated by this process.
Georgia Power’s need for new generation has exploded in the past two years, driven largely by a flood of plans to build [data centers in the region](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/data-centers-are-overwhelming-the-grid-could-they-help-it-instead). The utility has 2022. That projected boom in demand has somewhat scrambled the standard processes for utility resource planning, Whitfield told Canary Media.
In its last full-scale IRP in 2022, Georgia Power identified enough resources to cover its needs until 2029, she said. But it also identified an approximately 500 MW gap between demand and supply from 2029 to 2031, and agreed with regulators to launch the all-source RFP to fill it. That all-source RFP process is not subject to the same disclosure rules as an IRP, as it involves competitive bidding between the utility and third-party energy project developers.
Regulators approved an interim IRP last year that allows Georgia Power to build 1.4 GW of fossil-fueled power plants and 500 MW of batteries, and to contract for nearly 1 GW more from other utilities’ coal- and gas-fired power plants, to relieve some of its nearer-term pressures.
But the all-source RFP launched back in 2022 has remained Georgia Power’s main mechanism to get what it needs by 2031, Whitfield said. That’s despite the fact that it was initially meant to cover just 500 MW, a figure nearly 20 times smaller than the 9.5 GW it is now planning to fill via the all-source RFP process.
This has created something of a regulatory shell game in which Georgia Power can contract for the vast majority of its future energy and capacity needs outside the purview of the standard IRP process, said Simon Mahan, executive director of the Southern Renewable Energy Association trade group.
“Many organizations and companies focus exclusively on the IRP, while the ultimate decisions may occur in a totally separate docket, where fewer intervening parties are engaged,” he said.
The battle over Georgia Power’s missing gigawatts comes as the utility has failed to bring as much renewable energy into its resource mix as it previously pledged to.
The utility has 2025 IRP calls for an additional 3.5 GW of renewable energy by the end of 2030, but that plan partially just makes up for the utility’s cancellation of previous clean-power procurements, Mahan noted.
Solar alone can’t meet Georgia Power’s capacity needs, which are driven by demand for electricity for heating in wintertime.
But batteries that can store solar or general grid power could play a more significant role. Regulators approved Georgia Power to add IRP, and its 2025 IRP calls for further expanding its energy storage capacity. Mahan noted that much of the solar power being proposed in the state will likely be paired with batteries to enhance its value to Georgia Power’s grid.
Without more information on the contents of the all-source RFP, it’s nearly impossible for environmental groups, consumer advocates, and other stakeholders to know whether Georgia Power is properly weighing renewable alternatives to gas-fired power plants that the utility will build and own itself.
## **The big picture on carbon and cost**
Georgia Power’s 60% of its capacity last year — is certainly a problem for the climate. The Sierra Club calculates that the generation mix laid out in Georgia Power’s proposed 2025 IRP would make the utility “one of the top greenhouse gas emitters in the U.S.”
It could be a problem for utility customers, too, who have already seen rates rise significantly in recent years due to Georgia Power’s 
Like most regulated utilities, Georgia Power earns a set rate of profit on investments in power plants, power grids, and other capital assets. It’s also required to allow third-party developers to compete with it to build solar and battery projects — a process that can yield lower costs for its customers but also lower rates of return for the utility.
Regulators have a responsibility to closely monitor the utility’s process for choosing which resources end up winning to ensure those decisions aren’t maximizing Georgia Power’s profits at the expense of its customers, said Patty Durand, a 
“We need to keep stock of how many gigawatts of fossil fuel Georgia Power is building or keeping on the grid because of data centers,” she said. “That is a climate change disaster.”
Durand has also challenged Georgia Power’s load-growth forecasts, noting that the utility has consistently 
“Are utility bills a kitchen-table issue? If they are, these guys are in trouble,” she said. “Data centers are about to make the bills we pay now into a joke.”
Some of the tech giants playing a role in the data center expansion driving Georgia Power’s demand forecasts have similar concerns. Last year, 
Georgia Power also faced pushback from the Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA), which represents companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft that are simultaneously planning major data center expansions and striving to decarbonize their energy supplies. In CEBA warned that “some of the new load Georgia Power is forecasting may not materialize if Georgia Power increases the carbon intensity of its resource mix.”
CEBA ended up supporting last year’s interim IRP on the condition that Georgia Power follow through with a promise to offer large industrial and commercial customers new options to bring more carbon-free resources onto the utility’s grid.
Georgia Power’s 2025 IRP lays out a “customer-identified resource” proposal to meet its end of the bargain, said Katie Southworth, CEBA’s deputy director of market and policy innovation for the South and Southeast. In simple terms, the utility would allow big customers to work with third-party developers to build solar, batteries, and other carbon-free resources that they could use to power their data centers and other large facilities. That’s a fairly common practice in parts of the country operating under competitive energy markets — but not in Georgia and most of the U.S. Southeast, where utilities remain vertically integrated.
However, the utility’s plan lacks transparency and certainty about how customer-proposed projects will be assessed and approved, and it limits the scale and scope of resources that big customers can bring to the table. Georgia Power also plans to delay implementation of that program, frustrating CEBA members eager to start searching for potential projects.
Hawkins, the Georgia Power spokesperson, told Canary Media that the utility continues to “incorporate CEBA’s feedback into our program designs, while still ensuring that all Georgia Power customers are protected. Our proposed IRP portfolio of renewable procurements and programs represents a continuation of our steady and measured renewable growth that delivers benefits to all customers.”
In the meantime, Southworth said, CEBA is encouraging Georgia Power customers looking for cleaner energy options to “get involved in the design of the all-source process. That gives us a chance to include other resources that could play a role.”
That may be an option for qualified energy developers active in that competitive procurement. But it remains unclear if or how the Public Service Commission will push Georgia Power to open the hood on that process for consumer advocates and environmental groups that have been denied information thus far.
“This is an exceptionally unusual time in the Georgia energy world for a million reasons, of which this is one. I think this is a hugely important issue,” Whitfield said. The investments being planned today are “going to transform our energy system,” and Georgia Power is conducting that work “without providing critical information about what that new system might look like.”
But time is running short to order more transparency. Georgia Power plans to announce the winning bids for its all-source RFP in July, Whitfield said — the same month that state regulators expect to take their final vote on the IRP.","Utilities, Fossil fuels, Policy regulation, Southeast, Georgia",georgia-power-plan-gas-expansion.md,articles_utilities

If true, battery startups are in trouble — and renewables are in luck.

Energy storage is having a moment — but the batteries that are [taking off today](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/chart-us-is-set-to-shatter-grid-battery-records-this-year) only have enough juice to provide a few hours of grid power. Developers technically could stack up more batteries for longer-term storage, but that gets prohibitively expensive. For a renewables-dominated grid to ride out days of poor solar production or even just an entire night, a [breakthrough in cost-effective, longer-term storage](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/long-duration-energy-storage/long-duration-energy-storage-can-help-clean-up-the-grid-but-only-if-its-super-cheap) is needed.
Over the last couple decades, venture capitalists have recognized this transformative possibility and heaped billions of dollars into the sector known as long-duration energy storage, or LDES. They have little to show for their efforts. The startups that haven’t gone bankrupt have built some factories and early installations, but have not built any particularly large-scale projects, at least in the U.S.
A few weeks ago, I saw something in the desert outside Reno, Nevada, that got me thinking the investors and startups may have been barking up the wrong tree all along.
Former Tesla Chief Technology Officer JB Straubel [unveiled a surprising new project](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/redwood-used-batteries-data-center) in June at the Tahoe campus of his lithium-ion recycling company, [Redwood Materials](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/recycling-renewables/redwood-materials-lands-1b-to-boost-its-battery-recycling-efforts). Instead of ripping apart old electric vehicle battery packs, his engineers arranged them across a patch of desert and hooked them up to an adjacent solar field. This assemblage now stores so much clean power that it can run a small on-site data center, rain or shine, night or day.
In other words, instead of inventing a brand-new technology tailored for long-term storage, Redwood made it way cheaper to stack enough time-tested lithium-ion batteries to accomplish that goal.
Unveiling this new business line, Straubel wasn’t just diversifying his revenue streams. He was staking claim to the long-duration storage market writ large.
“We’re confident this is the lowest-cost storage solution out there,” Straubel said. “Not only just lower than new lithium-ion batteries, but lower than compressed-air energy storage, lower than iron-air, lower than a number of these other ones that carry a little more technology risk.”
As he spoke, Straubel pointed at a bar graph depicting the costs of those types of LDES technology, as well as thermal storage, pumped-hydro storage, and flow batteries. Naturally, the chart showed his used batteries clocking in cheaper than all of them.
It’s a big claim. Second-life battery development is even newer than the LDES field; prior to Redwood, only a handful of companies, like [ Storage Solutions](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/b2u-used-grid-batteries-texas-expansion) and [Element Energy](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/long-duration-energy-storage/the-biggest-grid-storage-project-using-old-batteries-is-online-in-texas), had built large-scale second-life storage plants, and those were just in the last few years. The sector has a lot of work to do to convince customers and financiers that the gently used battery packs can be trusted to hold up over years of service. And with new lithium-ion packs getting ever cheaper, the discount offered by used batteries may prove tenuous.
Still, Straubel’s first operating project, which holds 63 megawatt-hours of energy storage, is already bigger than any novel battery installation in the U.S. If Straubel takes this concept mainstream, it could revolutionize the arms race for long-duration storage — and radically improve the odds of running the economy on a largely renewable grid.
## **Starting off bigger and cheaper than LDES competition**
At the June event, Straubel essentially asserted that his band of desert engineers, in just a few months of tinkering, has outmaneuvered the researchers and companies working on long-duration for decades.
That deserves some scrutiny — but even pinpointing the costs of the competition is challenging.
“There are a lot of flavors of long-duration storage. What all of them have in common is that actual deployments have been very limited up until now,” said Pavel Molchanov, who analyzes cleantech companies for financial services firm Raymond James. “To make any clear-cut statements about which particular flavor is cheaper than any other would be quite premature.”
Redwood says its second-life battery installations cost less than $150 per kilowatt-hour today, for systems that can deliver power over 24 to 48 hours. The company’s datapoints on the prices of other battery types were drawn from BloombergNEF’s 2024
Iron-air is under development, most famously, by Straubel’s former Tesla Energy compatriot Mateo Jaramillo at Form Energy, a VC darling that’s [raised more than $1.2 billion](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/long-duration-energy-storage/form-energy-raises-405m-for-its-100-hour-iron-air-batteries) to date. Redwood calculated iron-air costs at higher than $150 per kilowatt-hour, but Form has stated its intentions to sell batteries [below $20 per kilowatt-hour](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/long-duration-energy-storage/long-duration-energy-storage-is-now-a-reality) when its factory reaches full production scale.
It’s worth noting that not all these technologies are directly comparable, because companies design and market them at different durations based on their technical sweet spots. If a technology works especially well at, say, 12 hours duration, the company might not even sell it for 48-hour configurations.
“Part of the issue with comparing long-duration storage systems and prices is that every company will give you their price point for a different duration,” said James Frith, a longtime battery analyst now at VC firm Volta Energy Technologies. “Then you’re thinking, how do I normalize this? How do we get to a base point that is comparable amongst the technologies?”
Epistemological issues aside, Redwood accurately diagnoses that the LDES sector’s struggle to deliver real installations at super-low cost leaves an opening for new competitors.
Brand-new lithium-ion batteries aren’t economically viable at longer durations, though their limits keep expanding as battery prices fall.
“Lithium-ion storage systems with longer durations require more battery cells, making the system capital-intensive and less economically competitive compared to emerging long-duration storage alternatives,” said Evelina Stoikou, head of battery technology and supply chain research at BloombergNEF.
Pumped-hydro and compressed-air energy storage work for longer durations, but they are huge, billion-dollar infrastructure projects of the sort that don’t get built anymore in the U.S. (Canadian company Hydrostor is attempting to break that curse with a [$1.5 billion, 500 MW/4,000 Mwh compressed air project](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/massive-underground-air-battery-project-lands-1-76b-doe-award) in California; if it gets permits to build, it might be online by 2030.)
[Flow batteries](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/batteries/battery-week-competitors-to-lithium-ion-batteries-in-the-grid-storage-market#:~:text=most%20realistic%20shot.\)-,Flow%20batteries,-Flow%20batteries%20operate) — which store energy in tanks of liquid electrolytes — have been kicking around for decades with some success in China, where they benefit from government favor. In the U.S., they’ve not gained much traction.
Meanwhile, many LDES startups have made the strategic error of designing exotic storage solutions to eke out a few more hours, under the incorrect assumption that lithium-ion would never be able to compete at four, then six, and then eight hours.
Take ESS, which has developed an iron-based flow battery since 2011: Despite leaning into “long-duration” branding, the company was [selling an Energy Warehouse](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/long-duration-energy-storage/sacramento-utility-rolls-out-its-first-long-duration-grid-batteries) with a bit over six hours duration, and only this year announced a “strategic shift to the 10+ hour product.” (Its board members had to 
The LDES companies most vulnerable to competition from Redwood are the ones that aren’t actually very long-duration, and which haven’t gotten big enough to make their products cheaper. 
## **LDES strikes back**
That’s not to say the other LDES contenders are left quaking in their boots.
“We’re a long way away from proof that second-life batteries are a proper utility-grade asset, capable of 20 years of daily cycling,” said Ben Kaun, who for years analyzed LDES technologies for the Electric Power Research Institute and now works for [battery startup Inlyte Energy](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/batteries/inlyte-energy-storage-tech-utility). “I don’t see an existential threat to LDES.”
The sector has even been showing signs of life, at least compared to its dismal track record from the preceding decade. Form completed its factory in Weirton, West Virginia, and 100-hour system of its own iron-air battery, based on research at the Delft University of Technology.
Flow batteries have built up considerable installed capacity in China, but that trend hasn’t gotten much coverage in English-language press, said Eugene Beh, CEO and cofounder of California-based flow-battery startup 
Italian startup [Energy Dome](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/long-duration-energy-storage/energy-dome-is-the-rare-long-duration-storage-firm-thats-moving-fast) has moved swiftly from demo to commercial operations with an iconoclastic design: It stores energy by compressing carbon dioxide in a controlled environment; decompressing it turns a turbine and generates electricity. After building a pilot and a commercial project in Sardinia, Energy Dome just announced an 
These more out-of-the-box LDES companies might take solace in a few limitations that second-life battery developers must overcome to mount a serious challenge.
Second-life companies take hundreds of batteries from different manufacturers, with different patterns of wear and tear, then operate them all in concert. If that was easy, more people would be doing it by now. Firms that get this wrong could start fires, and fire safety is one of the key arguments used against lithium-ion installations, both by rival technologists and the general public.
Then again, Straubel has as much experience as anyone with the inner workings of lithium-ion batteries. At Tesla, he built the nation’s leading electric-car company and a wildly successful stationary-storage business with the Powerwall and Megapack.
Then there’s the question of longevity. The batteries were pulled out of vehicles for a reason: usually due to their capacity degrading, though other problems develop with age, like higher internal resistance, which makes batteries heat up during discharge. If second-life packs need to be swapped out too frequently, it undercuts the ease and cheapness of the model.
That leaves the matter of supply. Success in second-life depends on a steady and cheap source of gently used EV packs. Here Redwood has a unique advantage, in that the company was constituted to collect the nation’s battery waste and recycle it. Straubel said Redwood was receiving less than 1 gigawatt-hour of used EV packs two years ago, and now is pulling in more than 5 GWh per year.
The available supply of used EV packs is “going to follow roughly the same curve as electric vehicle adoption, but lagging by, let’s say, 10 years,” Frith said. “So we are going to start seeing the volume of packs growing, and I think the real volumes start to kick in closer to 2030.”
Indeed, he added, the growth in volume of used EV packs could parallel the growth of demand for long-duration storage: Few customers buy it now, but many analysts expect demand to grow by the end of the decade as renewables saturate the grid.
## **Lithium just keeps winning**
It’s too soon to know if used EV batteries will actually wipe the floor with the more unconventional long-duration battery technologies. But the scale and price point of Redwood’s first project announces them as a force to be reckoned with in this arena.
In doing so, Redwood puts a new spin on an energy-storage maxim that venture capitalists keep forgetting, or simply ignoring: Lithium-ion always wins.
Challengers that rely on different chemistries have to build up from negligible production scale and convince customers to take a chance on a design that few people have seen before. It’s a clear uphill battle.
Lithium-ion batteries, in contrast, command an unmatched and ever-expanding scale of industrial production, mostly in China but increasingly in the U.S. too. That manufacturing juggernaut unlocks incremental gains from economies of scale and continual innovation. It also confers consumer confidence, because the technology has such a clear track record of performance.
“Compared to most experts’ predictions, the costs have gone down faster and the performance has improved faster for lithium-ion than people predicted 10 years ago,” said Jeff Chamberlain, who helped the Department of Energy license battery technology to General Motors and LG Chem back in the late 2000s, and now invests in storage technologies as CEO of Volta Energy Technologies.
Nonetheless, investors continued to bet that the streak would end, and they could own a piece of the transformational tech that would triumph for longer-term storage.
“What a lot of startups and investors are doing is assuming the LDES market will exist and it will be enormous, and they’re assuming lithium-ion won’t solve the problem,” Chamberlain said. “I believe that is a very, very bad assumption.”
Over the last decade, lithium-ion has steadily chipped away at use cases where new battery inventions were supposed to win out. New lithium-ion is starting to push into six-hour configurations and beyond, said Stoikou, from BloombergNEF. Global average pricing for turnkey grid storage averaged $165 per kilowatt-hour in 2024, per the data firm’s 2024 survey.
Now, the cost savings from reusing lithium-ion packs accelerate the chemistry’s push into the long-duration market — something that would be a big win for grid-decarbonization efforts, while delivering the LDES hopefuls yet another stinging loss.

President Donald Trump’s crusade against wind energy is intensifying — and it could come with some serious costs.
As much as $317 billion in lost investment, to be exact, per 790 projects totaling 213 gigawatts that developers plan to build in the years to come — all of which are at risk of delay or even cancellation under the administration’s policies.
To be clear, those figures represent the high end of what’s at stake — they’re based on what’s currently in the interconnection queue, and projects drop out of that process all the time for various reasons.
But if even a fraction of that investment is canceled or delayed, it will be painful for the regions that miss out on the tax revenue and jobs, with Texas, Illinois, and New Jersey standing to lose the most.
It would also be bad timing: [Electricity demand is on the rise](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/data-centers-are-driving-us-power-demand-to-hard-to-reach-heights) nationwide, largely due to the boom in [AI data center construction](https://www.canarymedia.com/boon-or-bane-what-will-data-centers-do-to-the-grid).

Wind produced just over 10% of U.S. electricity last year.
And, of course, any slowdown in the construction of clean energy is a setback for efforts to transition the U.S. away from fossil fuels, a task that grows more urgent with the passage of every hot summer day.

President Donald Trump has been derailing U.S. efforts to cut planet-warming emissions since he moved back into the White House. Now we have a more precise accounting of the expected damage.
The U.S. is currently on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions just 26-35% below 2005 levels over the next decade, 
That’s much less of a reduction than was forecast under the Biden administration. A July 2024 38-56% by 2035. In other words, the _worst-case_ scenario under Biden last year was still better than the _best-case_ scenario following Trump’s destruction of the country’s decarbonization strategy.
As it stands, the U.S. will miss its 2030 Paris Agreement commitment by a mile — a fact unlikely to trouble Trump, who abandoned the agreement on his first day back in office.
The new Rhodium findings illustrate how swiftly Trump and the GOP have undone the hard-fought energy-transition progress made by the Biden administration.
Three years ago, then-president Joe Biden signed the landmark Inflation Reduction Act into effect, creating generous tax incentives for renewables, home-energy upgrades, and electric vehicles, as well as a host of grant and loan programs aimed at accelerating industries away from fossil fuel use.
But the Trump administration and the GOP-controlled Congress have [essentially repealed](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/trump-big-beautiful-bill-industry-impacts) the law, as well as a host of other environmental protections, like limits on vehicle emissions, that would have helped not only rein in greenhouse gases but also reduce harmful air pollution.
It’s grim news. But inherent in this rapid reversal of progress is, if you squint, a kernel of hope: Trump has proven that things can change very fast. Under a new administration, a rapid change of trajectory could happen again.","Emissions reduction, Clean energy, Policy regulation",chart-trump-is-slowing-climate-progress-heres-how-much.md,articles_emissions-reduction
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/emissions-reduction/north-carolina-ditch-duke-goal-now-what,North Carolina ditched its 2030 climate goal. Now what?,26 August 2025,Elizabeth Ouzts,"Rising power demand and the low cost of renewables may give wind and solar a fighting chance even though Duke Energy no longer has to cut emissions in the near term. 
There’s no sugarcoating it: A new North Carolina law unraveling utility Duke Energy’s climate goals is a massive setback for the state’s clean energy transition, and it’s being exacerbated by the Trump administration’s full-scale assault on wind and solar power across the country.
Yet many observers believe that in the short term the renewable energy sector will bend but not break — buoyed by the realities of rising electricity demand and the increasingly bleak economics of fossil fuels.
The Republican-led legislature passed 2030 deadline by which Duke must cut its carbon emissions by 70% compared to 2005 levels, though it retains a mandate for the utility to decarbonize by midcentury.
Those deadlines were set into state law in resounding “no” votes in the GOP-controlled House and Senate combined.
But it was a different era politically. Democrat Joe Biden had just won the presidency, spurred in part by 
Elected in 2024, Stein has made no secret of his support for clean energy, but his focus to date has been recovery after Hurricane Helene, which struck the state nearly a year ago. Republicans in the General Assembly are only one vote shy of a supermajority. President Donald Trump’s stunning attack on wind, solar, and climate science has given license to like-minded allies in his party and in [powerful state industrial groups](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/industry-duke-north-carolina-carbon-plan) to follow his lead.
The utility landscape has also shifted dramatically. In 2021, Duke, ever-influential with lawmakers, was willing to compromise on a wide-ranging energy bill to secure approval for a [long-sought multiyear ratemaking scheme](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/why-critics-say-duke-energy-backed-ratemaking-reforms-in-n-c-fall-short). Before a cleantech manufacturing resurgence and the explosion of AI, the company also faced relatively flat electric demand. State utility regulators, all but one appointed by Cooper, appeared inclined toward climate action, even if they sometimes 
## **A new political and energy reality**
Today, Republican-appointed members — including one with SB 266, the panel wasted no time in ordering Duke to 70%.
Duke still must zero out its climate-warming pollution by 2050, and its latest plan for doing so is due Oct. 1. But if predictions from Public Staff, the state-sanctioned customer advocate, are any indication, removing the near-term goal could mean seismic changes to the company’s forecast for the next decade.
With the blessing of regulators, the company was already on pace to [miss the interim target](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/regulators-ok-duke-energys-gas-plant-buildout-despite-n-c-climate-law) by five years. Without any midway goal, Duke could build about 12 fewer gigawatts of new power capacity by 2035 and lean harder on aging fossil-fuel plants and purchased power instead. The forgone generation includes 4.4 gigawatts of solar, 2.8 gigawatts of battery storage, and 4.5 gigawatts of wind, according to Public Staff.
Advocates are working hard to make sure those predictions don’t come true.
One dynamic that may help is the urgency of rising electricity demand. According to 6 new gigawatts of capacity by 2030.
Yet P Global. And Duke plans to be a so-called second mover on small modular nuclear reactors — meaning it doesn’t foresee becoming the first U.S. utility to put the nascent resource into service. A new reactor 10 years, per the company.
## **“ It’s a matter of meeting a deficit”**
Even if the most extreme predictions about new economic development don’t pan out, solar and battery storage, and even onshore wind, are all poised to fill a need left by these delays, advocates say.
“It’s a matter of meeting a deficit — a potential deficit — in energy demand,” said Karly Brownfield, a senior program manager with Southeastern Wind Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for the industry. With similar development timelines as gas and a well-established and tested permitting process in the state, she said, “I think onshore wind is definitely going to continue to move to the front.”
Another factor favoring renewables: cost. While the tax and spending bill signed by Trump this summer indubitably scrambles the calculus on wind and solar by [phasing out tax incentives](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/tax-credit-changes-trump-law) more quickly than before and making them [harder for developers to access](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/trump-admin-tightens-vise-on-wind-and-solar-with-new-tax-rules), these resources are still 
At the same time, the specter of rising natural gas prices should loom large, says Josh Brooks, chief of policy strategy and innovation with the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association. “The passage of SB 266 puts into sharp focus retail ratepayer exposure to fuel-price volatility,” he said. “The best and quickest opportunity to address that risk is through distributed renewables — especially solar paired with storage.”
Brownfield is also not giving up on offshore wind, despite the Trump administration’s [aggressive antipathy](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-admin-halts-construction-of-nearly-finished-offshore-wind-farm) for ocean-based turbines and 
“They’re early enough in the process that they feel like they can mitigate that risk over the next couple of years,” Brownfield said. “The conversation about offshore wind is not going to go away.”
Advocates also point to the colossal economic development impact of renewables in the state — from the farmers who increase their profit margins by leasing land for turbines or solar panels to the county commissioners looking to fund public schools. An [analysis released just before lawmakers passed SB 266](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-jobs/north-carolina-bill-duke-impact) showed the law could cut investment in power plant construction by more than $47.2 billion between 2030 and 2035, and reduce tax revenue by more than $1.4 billion — mostly because of forgone renewable energy development.
In hurricane-prone North Carolina, resiliency concerns loom large, too, said Brooks, who noted the success of solar microgrids and other climatetech in the wake of Helene’s devastation. “There’s no doubt about it that that was the quickest way to respond to Helene,” he said. “As incidents like that increase, we’re only going to see more need for the utility to think about decentralized assets.”
## **Regulatory decisions on the horizon**
Even without the 2030 carbon goal, clean energy advocates will have several chances over the next year to advance these arguments before the Utilities Commission.
An analysis of Duke’s 2026. What’s more, Duke is proposing to 2027.
“There’s going to be tens of billions of dollars of investment decisions made at the regulatory level in the next year,” said Will Scott, Southeast climate and clean energy director for Environmental Defense Fund.
“Given how big a piece hydrogen was in their 2050 plan, in terms of reducing emissions from the new proposed gas units, that’s going to be good to keep an eye on,” Scott said.
Still, the immediate future of renewables is likely to depend most on Duke itself, whose sway with regulators appears steadfast as ever. And the company’s shareholders, who per one Wall Street firm secured a “more predictable earnings trajectory” from the passage of SB 266, could pull away from wind and solar and toward more robust investments in fossil fuels.
What’s more, the current political climate, as set by the White House, could embolden anti-clean-energy lawmakers to push to eliminate Duke’s carbon goals entirely before possible Republican losses in next year’s midterms.
Advocates are clear-eyed about that risk. But they also point to electric bills that are [already rising](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/electricity-prices-rising-trump-impact?amp%3Butm_medium=email&%3Butm_campaign=canary&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--NN_z-S9ONBoCv_5xq9jw6GaaPBxo9X9kfJX9TiCC8fP2HBImWnoFPpHK624HoqvRkD9tv4btgY6FnLFSS9pdwNUz9H_twOO4CKpLEyGbMTf3HjG4&_hsmi=377102898&utm_source=newsletter) and predicted to [climb even more](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/emissions-reduction/north-carolina-bill-slow-energy-construction) under SB 266, especially for [households](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/north-carolina-bill-electricity-costs). That could create the impetus for bipartisan legislation to course correct.
“I can easily foresee a world where we do not have to engage much to get parts of this bill overturned in a future session once the economic realities of it hit the ratepayers,” Brooks said.","Emissions reduction, Clean energy, Policy regulation, Utilities, Southeast, North Carolina",north-carolina-ditch-duke-goal-now-what.md,articles_emissions-reduction

State legislators pushing to unravel North Carolina’s climate law say their bill will give utility Duke Energy more leeway to build new gas and nuclear power plants and save its Tar Heel customers billions of dollars.
But Gov. Josh Stein disagrees: He vetoed 70% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, while leaving a 2050 carbon-neutrality deadline intact.
“This summer’s record heat and soaring utility bills has shown that we need to focus on lowering electricity costs for working families — not raising them,” Stein, a Democrat, said in a statement. “My job is to do everything in my power to lower costs and grow the economy. This bill fails that test.”
In issuing his veto, Stein pointed to a SB 266 could cause Duke to build less generation capacity over the next decade, just as electricity needs are expected to surge.
That means Duke would have to lean harder on aging plants and burn almost 40% more natural gas between 2030 and 2050, experts at N.C. State University say. Under a worst-case but plausible scenario for gas prices, customers could pay $23 billion more on their electric bills by midcentury as a result.
“As our state continues to grow, we need to diversify our energy portfolio so that we are not overly reliant on natural gas and its volatile fuel markets,” Stein said.
A complex measure that’s faced little public debate, SB 266 easily cleared both chambers of the Republican-controlled General Assembly in June with a handful of Democratic votes. With Stein’s action, advocates now turn their focus back to state lawmakers, who are on break for GOP has the three-fifths majority needed to override the veto in the Senate, but is one member shy of that margin in the House.
“Governor Stein is championing working families all across North Carolina who would be harmed by this new law,” said Will Scott, Southeast climate and clean energy director for the Environmental Defense Fund. “Legislators should reconsider the harmful consequences of this law for the working families in their districts.”
The N.C. State study underscores a surprising finding from Public Staff’s modeling: SB 266 does little to prepare North Carolina for ballooning electricity needs expected from an influx of data centers, manufacturers, and new residents. In fact, removing the 2030 goal would prompt Duke to build 11,700 fewer megawatts of new power plants in the next decade than its current plans.
“In talking with legislators, I found that almost all of them emphasized economic growth and the need for power generation to meet that demand,” said Scott. “But Public Staff’s analysis found that the most likely short-term impact of SB 266 is to build less new generation and storage and instead to lean harder on aging coal and gas facilities.”
The Public Staff forecast shows renewable energy would be the main short-term casualty of SB 266, just as its backers intend. By 2035, Duke would construct 7,200 fewer megawatts of solar and battery storage, and no offshore or onshore wind farms whatsoever — a 4,500-megawatt decrease compared with the status quo.
But new “always-on” nuclear and gas resources — the same ones SB 266 champions seek to promote — would also suffer. Without a near-term carbon reduction deadline, Public Staff says Duke would develop just 300 megawatts of nuclear power in the next decade, half as much as it currently plans. The utility would build 1,400 fewer megawatts of large, efficient combined-cycle gas units.
Only gas “peaker plants” — simple-cycle combustion turbines that are relatively cheap to build but expensive to operate — would become more abundant, Public Staff forecasts. Duke would build 3,800 megawatts’ worth instead of 2,100.
The model’s underlying assumptions haven’t been made public. But experts say the reason for this short-term impact is likely that without a carbon constraint, it’s simply cheaper to run existing coal and gas plants more often than it is to build new ones.
The same Public Staff study predicts that removing the 2030 target would yield $13 billion in present value in customer savings by 2050 — a figure much vaunted by SB 266 supporters.
But detractors have long pointed out that the discount comes from avoided construction costs only and doesn’t account for the price of fuel, 100% of which is passed to utility customers through a “rider” on monthly bills.
As it happens, the $23 billion in added fuel costs estimated by N.C. State translates to $13 billion in present value.
“That is a pure coincidence,” said Jeremiah Johnson, one of the researchers. “It completely negates the claimed savings.”
Duke might also have to buy more power from utilities in neighboring states to meet electricity needs, another blow to residential consumers, who under SB 266 would [pay a higher fraction of those costs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/north-carolina-bill-electricity-costs) than they do today.
“This bill not only makes everyone’s utility bills more expensive,” Stein said, “but it also shifts the cost of electricity from large industrial users onto the backs of regular people — families will pay more so that industry pays less.”
Advocates also point to the simple public health rationale for keeping the state’s 2030 pollution-reduction goal intact. Relying on existing coal and gas plants instead of building more solar means 
Then, there’s the commonsense argument, said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association: “You don’t establish a 30-year goal without milestones along the way.” Achieving emissions reductions is like saving enough money for retirement — it takes planning and can’t be done in just a couple of years. “These things do not happen overnight,” he said.
Abele’s group analyzed the 
The reason, according to state Rep. Maria Cervania, a Democrat from Wake County who voted against SB 266? “Deadlines matter.”
At a news conference last week, she said that the 2030 goal has given “us a clear, science-based target to hold the utilities accountable. … Without it, progress slows and polluters face no urgency to act.”

State legislatures saw a torrent of anti-clean energy bills introduced this year — and little more than a trickle of measures that would benefit renewables. Fortunately, most of the legislation was not signed into law.
As of June, with most states’ legislative sessions wrapped up for the year, 305 bills related to the siting of new clean energy developments had been introduced across 47 states, according to a 148 would likely have made it harder to build renewables, while just 68 would have helped wind, solar, or battery storage projects move forward. The remaining 89 would have had a neutral or unclear impact.
The vast majority of these bills stalled out, and of the few that were signed into law, slightly more were favorable to clean energy than hostile to it. Ten pro-renewables siting laws passed versus seven that are expected to restrict clean energy.
Still, the flood of new anti-renewables legislation underscores the increasingly hostile policy environment for clean energy.

The California state Capitol in Sacramento (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)
California’s Legislature has approved a slate of policies aimed at curbing high and rising electricity costs, involving everything from short-term relief for high summertime utility bills to public financing of transmission grids — a big accomplishment in the waning days of the session.
The affordability measures emerged as part of a sprawling 
“It’s just a massive end of session,” said state Sen. Josh Becker, a Democrat whose bill, “We had all these planes in the air. Are they all going to crash, or are they going to land?”
Becker hopes the provisions in SB 254 will contain rapidly rising costs for the state’s three biggest utilities — Pacific Gas Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas Electric — which [are in turn driving up rates](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/californias-utility-bill-crisis-is-clear-to-all-the-solution-not-so-much) for their customers. Those residents now pay 
“Energy affordability was understood to be one of the top issues the Legislature needed to act on, due to massive rate increases and widespread customer outrage,” said Matthew Freedman, staff attorney at The Utility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy group that supported SB 254.
Among other things, that legislation aims to rein in how much utilities spend hardening their grids to reduce the risk of sparking wildfires, 
It would also create a new “transmission accelerator” that enables utilities to use public financing to expand the state’s high-voltage grid rather than recoup those expenditures by charging customers. Those savings will take longer to kick in but could add up to billions of dollars a year, said Sam Uden, managing director of Net-Zero California, an advocacy group that cowrote a report last year examining how much utilities could save by relying on public financing.
“There’s a strategic role for public-sector investment to drive the clean energy transition,” he said. “We see this transmission financing as an embodiment of that viewpoint.”
## **Cutting the cost of California’s power grid**
SB 254 ended up as a 136-page document with a multitude of energy and climate provisions, Becker told Canary Media last week. But he highlighted one set of key cost-containment measures that the utilities had particularly resisted.
Utilities typically earn a profit by receiving a return on the investments they make in grid upkeep. Now, though, California’s big three utilities will have to finance a portion of what they spend hardening their grids via bonds — a 
Utilities “were kicking and screaming on that,” Becker said.
The amount to be financed through bonds was initially set to be $15 billion for all three utilities. But Freedman suggested that the utilities might have used their political clout last week to negotiate the final securitization requirement down to $6 billion, which is “a pretty big reduction,” he said.
Regardless, securitizing a portion of the growing grid-hardening costs will reduce pressure on utilities to increase rates in the future, said Merrian Borgeson, California policy director for climate and energy for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which supported the legislation. “I don’t know what the rates are going to be next year, but they’ll be lower,” she said.
Enabling public financing of transmission projects could deliver even more savings over time, Borgeson said. The “transmission accelerator” created by SB 254 for that purpose would be based out of the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz). That entity would be authorized to pool state funds drawn from California’s cap-and-trade program and from a [climate bond passed last year](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/california-voters-pass-10b-bond-to-help-protect-people-from-climate-change) to lower the cost of capital for transmission projects.
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state’s grid, 46 billion and $63 billion into transmission over the next 20 years to meet its goal of achieving a carbon-free grid by 2045. Using public money to offset a portion of utilities’ capital spending on those projects could cut the costs of the currently planned long-range transmission buildout by more than half, saving customers as much as $3 billion a year, according to an 
Just how much money could be saved will depend on how the accelerator structures its public-private financing, Freedman said. “SB 254 leaves open a range of possible outcomes on this front,” he added. “It depends on the ambitiousness of the implementation by this and future governors.”
## **Cap-and-trade climate credit offers fast bill relief**
The final days of this year’s session also saw lawmakers 2030. 2045 and make a number of changes with significant implications for polluting industries, though regulators and lawmakers still need to work out the exact structures for executing the new rules, Borgeson said.
The bills also take an initial stab at reallocating funds raised by the cap-and-trade system to the myriad state programs and industry sectors jockeying for the money.
For example, one key affordability measure in AB 1207 institutes important changes to the “
Today, those credits are delivered to customers in twice-a-year lump-sum rebates. Under the 
“Just think about the Central Valley,” Becker said during a “it’s 100 degrees all day — and sometimes all night — in those areas. It’s literally a matter of life and death to keep the air conditioning on.”
AB 1207 will also redirect climate credits issued to gas utilities to support lowering summer electrical bills exclusively, through a process to be worked out by California utility regulators, Borgeson said. (Today, both gas utilities and electric utilities issue climate credits to their customers.)
That provision was strongly opposed by Sempra, the holding company of San Diego Gas Electric and Southern California Gas Co., the state’s biggest gas-only utility. In an opposition letter, Sempra said the shift would create a “statewide subsidy requiring gas customers to fund bill relief for electric customers, worsening the high cost of living in California for millions of families.”
But climate advocates say the legislation aligns with California’s goal of shifting customers from using gas to using electricity. “This is a good idea, because it doesn’t need any more money,” Juliet Christian-Smith, Western states program director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told Canary Media in July. Instead, “it’s redirecting money already in a pot to reduce electricity rates and enable the clean energy transition in a more affordable way.”","Policy regulation, Clean energy, Utilities, West, California",california-2025-energy-affordability-passed.md,articles_policy-regulation
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ocean-energy/eco-wave-power-port-la-tech,Will this startup be the first to successfully scale up ocean power?,10 September 2025,Julian Spector,"Many companies have failed to harness the sea’s energy. Eco Wave Power thinks its shore-mounted tech, which it just installed at a wharf in LA, can buck the trend. 
Eco Wave Power's 100-kilowatt system in LA uses seven steel ""floaters"" that bob with the waves, building up hydraulic pressure that is then converted into electric power. (Arturo Garcia-Ayala, Eco Wave Power)
Trapping the energy of ocean waves to generate electricity has long been an enticing but notoriously difficult endeavor. The first rule of wave power startups is that they always fail. But a plucky company called 
Eco Wave Power has installed a 100-kilowatt system on a concrete wharf in the Port of Los Angeles, which it officially unveiled Tuesday. Seven steel “floaters” affixed to the structure bob with the waves, building up hydraulic pressure that gets converted to electric power by machinery in shipping containers onshore.
The project isn’t sending that power to the grid just yet, CEO Inna Braverman noted in an interview. The goal of this installation is to demonstrate the technology to stakeholders and potential customers, so it’s located in an easily accessible area in the harbor where the waves aren’t that powerful.
The bigger prize would be to install far more floaters along the 8-mile breakwater that protects the Port of LA, Braverman said, adding that this length could generate 60 megawatts with her company’s proprietary technology. The benefits are alluring: Systems in wave-battered locations can produce energy about 90% of the time, Braverman said, making for a nearly round-the-clock clean power supply close to densely populated coastal cities, without taking up valuable real estate. And the floaters actually protect the coastal barriers by absorbing the force of oncoming waves.
Eco Wave Power is backing up these assertions by self-funding a 1-megawatt installation on the coast of Porto in northern Portugal, which should be up and running by September 2026.
“We’re going to show for the first time that we can generate significant energy amounts, more than solar and wind for the same footprint,” Braverman said. The 40 large-scale floaters would export power to Portugal’s grid and compete on the spot market. If all goes well, the company wants to expand the installation to 20 megawatts.
Success there could usher in a new form of renewable energy, that operates more like always-available baseload power than intermittent solar and wind, which are nonetheless the [fastest-growing generation sources](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-96-percent-of-new-us-power-capacity-was-carbon-free-in-2024) on the U.S. grid these days. The work in LA is laying a foundation to move quickly on American deployments when the opportunity arises.
## **New wave tech, new rules**
This journey started back in 2022, when Braverman [partnered with the nonprofit AltaSea](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ocean-energy/is-shore-based-wave-power-the-key-to-unlocking-affordable-clean-energy-from-the-sea), which renovated a century-old dockside warehouse in the Port of LA to incubate ocean-centric technologies. The property was constructed in the 1910s to hold cargo brought in from the newly built Panama Canal, said AltaSea CEO Terry Tamminen; now it hosts kelp cultivators and underwater construction innovators.
Founded in 2011, Eco Wave Power had tested its equipment at a small scale in Gibraltar for six years and was installing it in Jaffa, Israel, but wanted to bring it to American audiences. Tamminen thought the company fit the mission of AltaSea and could help California, with its 1,100 miles of coastline, close the gap in its mission to run the whole grid on clean energy by 2045.
“We’re running out of the easy stuff, he said. “Wind, solar, even geothermal are well-worn pathways — we’re never going to get to 100% if we don’t tap other sources.”
It wasn’t clear just how long it would take to navigate multiple layers of permitting for a never-before-seen aquatic power generator. The startup needed permission from the Army Corps of Engineers, which governs the navigable waterways of the United States, as well as sign-off from the Port and other local and state authorities. Securing all those approvals ended up taking about two years, after which Eco Wave Power installed and commissioned the site in just four months, Braverman said.
But she was encouraged by that timeline, since this was the first-ever U.S. installation of its kind, and even well-known technologies have struggled through longer permitting processes.
In the meantime, Tamminen, who architected California’s wildly successful Million Solar Roofs initiative for former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R), pitched the state Legislature on supporting ocean power through the early stages of development. Sacramento agreed and in 2023
“We’re trying to use California’s size as the world’s fourth-largest economy to get these blue technologies scaled up, and that makes it faster, better, cheaper for everybody,” Tamminen said.
The California Energy Commission published a 2024, which could lay the groundwork for more supportive policies in the future.
## **A different kind of wave power**
If wave power can scale, it would be one of the precious few new electricity sources that have appeared on the scene since the rise of wind and solar. Next-generation nuclear designs have yet to send any power to the U.S. grid after years of effort and investment. Perhaps the closest thing to a new arrival is Fervo Energy’s advanced geothermal, which is operating in a [3.5-megawatt commercial project](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/americas-first-enhanced-geothermal-plant-just-got-up-and-running) in Nevada.
Worldwide, ocean power ventures have failed in spectacular fashion. Harnessing Neptune’s wrath makes intuitive sense to many landlubbers: There’s so much energy out there, why not use it? Analysts at the International Energy Agency calculated that ocean and tidal energy could more than 
The problem, as Odysseus learned long ago, is that Poseidon does not submit to the will of mortals. The list of ocean energy installations that broke and sank upon contact with waves is long and amusing to those who didn’t dedicate years of painstaking labor and millions of dollars to the doomed endeavors. And energy options don’t exist in a vacuum: Wave power, with all the costs to fortify it against the ocean itself, must compete with mass-manufactured solar panels to produce the exact same commodity, electricity.
Braverman is well aware of wave energy’s soggy past and the money wasted on contraptions “that ended up broken to pieces on the shoreline.” Her diagnosis of the field’s misfires informs both the technological and the business strategy at Eco Wave Power.
The firm’s design favors simplicity across the board. Others tried installing out at sea, where waves are more powerful, but they rack up costs for ships and specialist divers, and then suffer from the same powerful waves they try to harness. Instead, Eco Wave Power focuses on far more accessible seawalls and jetties, and absorbs the waves with welded steel pontoons while the sensitive power conversion equipment sits safely on land nearby.
Financially, Braverman strives to prove a lot while spending very little. The company raised about $30 million from venture capitalists and from going public, first in Sweden and now on the Nasdaq, where it boasts a market cap of $51 million.
Eco Wave Power employs 15 people, and contracts out welding and installation to local firms. Braverman found strategic partners to share the cost of early installations — international energy company EDF invested in the 100-kilowatt Jaffa project, which began exporting to the Israeli grid in August 2023, and Shell Marine Renewable Energy co-invested in the LA system.
Last year, Eco Wave Power burned just $2 million, Braverman noted, and ended the first half of this year with 
Still, financial discipline only matters here in service of generating clean power from the ocean. After delivering one project this year, Braverman expects to clinch three installations next year, in Taiwan, India, and Portugal. The commercial performance at Porto, with the company’s own money on the line, will become key evidence to persuade banks to lend money for future expansions of this singular technology.
The raging surf hasn’t killed this idea yet, but it still has to placate the gods of finance.","Ocean energy, Clean energy, West, California",eco-wave-power-port-la-tech.md,articles_ocean-energy

An affordable housing complex for older adults in Sacramento, California, boasts some enticing features.

And now, after an electric transformation of the buildings, Foothill Farms residents can also enjoy the [cleaner air](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/just-how-bad-are-gas-appliances-for-your-health?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) that comes with ditching gas appliances.
The project not only slashes the complex’s health-harming and planet-warming pollution — it also made financial sense for both the owner BRIDGE Housing and its tenants. Two years ago, the 138-unit property’s original gas-fired equipment was nearing the end of its life. Coupled with available financial support, the timing gave executives of BRIDGE, a nonprofit affordable housing developer and manager, a chance to pivot away from fossil fuels.
The “smart, opportunistic” project at Foothill Farms illustrates how properties can electrify while keeping costs low for residents, according to 13 nonprofits, including BRIDGE. The retrofit is also a trailblazer for the decarbonization journey

Some of the most vulnerable Americans live in subsidized apartments, including low-income households with older adults, disabled individuals, young families, and veterans — and they usually rent these units. Residents typically lack the power or cash to electrify properties, which presents a hurdle to eradicating emissions from buildings and denies inhabitants the upsides of these retrofits: greater comfort, safer air, and potential bill savings.
“There’s an opportunity for delivering outsized benefits to [these] residents and communities,” said Lucas Toffoli, principal of the carbon-free buildings division at clean-energy think tank RMI.
In 2023, BRIDGE Housing decided Foothill Farms would be a good candidate for energy-efficiency upgrades after Bright Power, an energy services provider, and Carbon Zero Buildings, a company specializing in decarbonization retrofits, analyzed BRIDGE’s entire portfolio of properties.
Carbon Zero carried out the electrifying changes: The turnkey contractor swapped out polluting gas-fueled water heaters for Rheem heat-pump water heaters and replaced ACs with Samsung [heat pumps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/a-beginners-guide-to-the-different-types-of-heat-pumps?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) capable of both warming and cooling spaces. The firm also installed LED lighting everywhere, which consumes a tenth of the energy of incandescent light bulbs.

Carbon Zero’s team first piloted the complete retrofit in one unit to work out the kinks. With feedback from staff and residents, the crew honed its approach so that it could complete a unit’s upgrades in a single day during business hours.
“I love that,” said Toffoli, who wasn’t involved in the project. “Displacing folks is not only expensive and burdensome … it’s a real disruption to people who may be juggling a lot of things, like work and family, or who have limited mobility or health problems.”
In the common areas, Carbon Zero installed a new heat-pump pool heater and heat-pump spa heater, 30 [EV charging](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/how-to-pick-the-best-electric-vehicle-charger-for-you?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) stations, and 240-volt power outlets in the laundry rooms. Foothill Farms still has gas-powered clothes dryers, but BRIDGE plans to replace them with [electric dryers](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/heat-pumps-are-everywhere-even-in-clothes-dryers?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) when they conk out.
Comparing 2023 average monthly energy usage data to 10 months of data after the in-unit retrofits were completed last spring, natural-gas use has decreased by 98% while electricity use has risen 24% across the whole property, thanks in large part to the almost-magical efficiency of heat pumps.
Virtually all of the project’s $2.6 million cost was covered by state and utility grants: California’s BRIDGE’s primary contact for the weatherization program incentive.
“It is typically in a property’s best interest to enroll [in these incentive programs] sooner than later,” Cohn told Canary Media. “The same project reserved today would receive less than half the [Sacramento Municipal Utility District] incentives Foothill Farms did due to updated incentive levels and per-project limits.”
Unlike many landlords who don’t pay tenants’ utility bills, and thus don’t benefit from energy-efficiency upgrades, BRIDGE actually had a financial incentive to make this switch to electric appliances: The organization pays for residents’ gas usage but not their electricity bills. How then did the project prevent residents’ costs from going up?
Elementary, my dear reader. Federal rules for most subsidized affordable housing protect residents from high rent and utility costs — and make sure these expenses don’t exceed 30% of their income — by requiring owners to provide what are called utility allowances, i.e., rent reductions to tenants paying their own utilities. The exact amounts are set by housing authorities and depend on locale, home size, and types of appliances. Based on the utility allowances for Sacramento when Carbon Zero pitched the project, the contractor estimated that residents would come out ahead, with each unit on average saving over $200 annually. The estimated savings for BRIDGE itself were $25,000 per year.
The real-world results match the initial project modeling very well, Cohn said, though BRIDGE declined to share specific dollar savings.
BRIDGE isn’t planning to stop with this project; a spokesperson said it’s already working with Carbon Zero and Bright Power on similar retrofits at a few other California properties.","Heat pumps, Carbon-free buildings, Electrification, Energy efficiency, California",affordable-housing-electrification-california_1.md,articles_heat-pumps

As summer temperatures sizzle, are you frantically shopping for central air conditioning? Take a breather, because you could get AC functionality — and more — by opting for an [increasingly popular](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/heat-pumps-keep-widening-their-lead-on-gas-furnaces) appliance: a heat pump.
All-electric [heat pumps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/a-beginners-guide-to-the-different-types-of-heat-pumps) are ACs, but better. Equipped with the ability to work in reverse, they not only dump heat outside in the summer, but can also pull heat indoors in the winter.
Heat pumps do often cost a bit more up front, but if you’re on the hunt for a new AC system anyway, the difference can be small enough that it’s worth exploring the option. After all, you could end up with AC _and_ a shiny new heating system, to boot.

## **1. Why should I get a heat pump instead of an AC?**
When [sized right](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/when-it-comes-to-heat-pumps-bigger-is-not-always-better), heat pumps let you simultaneously meet your cooling needs and proactively upgrade your heating system to one that’s better for your health and, typically, your wallet in the long run.
For most households, these two-in-one appliances [pay for themselves](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/will-a-heat-pump-save-you-money-it-depends) in reduced energy bills over their estimated 16-year lifetime.
Families that go from relying on expensive delivered fuels to electric heat pumps unlock the biggest cost savings: an average of 60 in savings per year. Utility customers with access to [electricity rates that favor heat pumps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/how-closing-the-spark-gap-can-boost-heat-pump-adoption) can save even more.
Other benefits? Heat pumps [slash planet-warming pollution](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/yes-heat-pumps-slash-emissions-even-if-powered-by-a-dirty-grid). Adopters report that the appliances [produce more even, comfortable heat](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/need-help-breaking-up-with-fossil-fuels-ask-an-electric-coach#:~:text=While%20he%E2%80%99s%20not%20sure%20if%20it%E2%80%99ll%20beat%20his%20old%20gas-fired%20system%20on%20monthly%20utility%20costs%20alone%2C%20the%20new%20heat%20pump%20already%20trounces%20it%20on%20comfort.%20The%20heat%20pump%20is%20providing%20more%20even%20heat%2C%20especially%20with%20the%20installation%20of%20the%20system%E2%80%99s%20new%20air%20handler.) than gas systems.

Oh, and if you’re okay with air-handling units on your walls, a [mini-split heat pump system](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/a-beginners-guide-to-the-different-types-of-heat-pumps#:~:text=What%20are%20ducted%20heat%20pumps%20vs.%20ductless%20mini-split%20heat%C2%A0pumps%3F) can let you get AC without having to install pricey ductwork.
The air-handling unit of a mini-split heat pump system in Minnesota provides cool comfort when it’s sweltering outside. (
## **2. What’s the cost difference between a heat pump and an AC? **
It’s AC, home-energy marketplace EnergySage reports. But the general consensus is that heat pumps do come at a bit of a premium.
Here’s one example: In California, it costs between [$900 and $1,900](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/a-call-to-replace-air-conditioners-with-heat-pumps-in-california) more to replace a broken central AC with a heat pump instead of a conventional AC. That’s out of a median total heat-pump installation cost of $15,900, per data from the 2021 to April 2024.
But spending on a heat pump can mean avoiding the expense of getting a new furnace. Southern California’s air-quality agency recently found that installing a heat pump in a single-family home in the region typically [costs $1,000 less](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/socal-nox-emissions-appliance-rules) than installing a gas furnace and AC.
Across the U.S., heat pump installations HVAC equipment, can depend on a dizzying number of factors, including the size of your home, its energy demand, your local climate, the equipment efficiency rating, the state of your home’s electrical system, and how familiar your local labor market is with the product. 
## **3. What financial incentives are available for heat pumps?**
For now, there’s the 2,000 off your federal tax bill for a qualifying heat pump. But if Republicans’ “Big, Beautiful Bill” passes in its current form, that tax credit will disappear [at the end of this year](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/senates-big-beautiful-bill-would-be-a-disaster-for-clean-energy). (All the more reason to get one this summer.)
Income-qualified households can check with their state energy office about the availability of Home Energy Rebates, an [$8.8 billion initiative](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-efficiency/inside-the-iras-historic-high-stakes-investment-in-energy-efficiency) created under the landmark 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Details vary by state, but [the law established](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/your-cheat-sheet-to-the-climate-laws-consumer-incentives) an $8,000 incentive for a heat pump, as well as rebates for enabling updates: $2,500 for electrical wiring and $4,000 for an electrical panel upgrade. While some state programs have rolled out after being finalized under the Biden administration, others still awaiting approvals 
29 states, with more soon to come, a spokesperson said.
## **4. How do I find the right contractor to install a heat pump?**
Get at least three quotes; the [specialize in home electrification](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-free-buildings/need-help-electrifying-your-home-startup-zero-homes-has-an-app-for-that) — and might offer [cutting-edge strategies](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/yes-its-possible-to-electrify-a-home-on-just-100-amps) to navigate a heat pump transition. Utility and local incentive programs may also have lists of participating installers.
But don’t stop there. See if there’s a local electrification group — like [offer free advice and recommend contractors](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/need-help-breaking-up-with-fossil-fuels-ask-an-electric-coach) they’ve worked with.

A heat pump on a snowy winter day. (Admitter)
Nearly 3 million Massachusetts households will have the chance to start saving money on heating next winter under new seasonal heat-pump rates from the state’s three major electric utilities.
Regulators have approved plans from Unitil and National Grid to reduce electricity rates for heat pump owners during the region’s often-frigid winter months, and Eversource is preparing its own proposal. Together, the three utilities provide service to about 86% of Massachusetts’ households.
The goal of the rates is to accelerate adoption of heat pumps by making it cheaper to run these super-efficient, low-carbon appliances in a region where the economics of switching from fossil-fueled heating don’t always pencil out for homeowners.
“The end result, all over Massachusetts, is that this will change the numbers. It will encourage heat pump adoption,” said Larry Chretien, executive director of the Green Energy Consumers Alliance. “Then the question will be: What do we do for an encore?”
Utility regulators are already looking into that question, 
Expanding the use of [heat pumps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/a-beginners-guide-to-the-different-types-of-heat-pumps?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) is a major part of Massachusetts’ strategy for reaching its ambitious goal of going carbon-neutral by 2050. Today, nearly 80% of the state’s homes burn fossil fuels — natural gas, heating oil, or propane — for heat. Many of the remaining homes use inefficient electric resistance heating.
The state’s climate plan calls for installing 500,000 heat pumps by 2030 to tackle emissions associated with building operations. Air-source heat pumps, the most common version of the appliance, use electricity to extract thermal energy from the surrounding air to heat and cool homes. The only greenhouse gas emissions associated with the systems are those that come from generating the electricity used.
## **The economics of operating a heat pump in Massachusetts**
The persistently high cost of electricity in Massachusetts — only three states had 
Most households now using oil, propane, or electric resistance heating would likely save money by using heat pumps, regardless of electric rates. But for many consumers using relatively cheap natural gas, the added electricity use from switching to heat pumps would drive their total costs up. That’s where seasonal heat-pump rates come into play, charging lower prices to homes using heat pumps so the added power consumption [doesn’t translate into higher total energy bills](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/how-closing-the-spark-gap-can-boost-heat-pump-adoption?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd).
Unitil was the first of Massachusetts’ three main investor-owned electric utilities to [put forth a seasonal heat-pump rate](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/advocates-hope-utilitys-winter-heat-pump-rate-discount-becomes-model-for-massachusetts-utilities?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd), receiving regulatory approval in June for a discount of 7 cents per kilowatt-hour — 64% below the summer rate. Regulators then [ordered National Grid](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/mass-regulator-orders-national-grid-to-set-lower-winter-rate-for-heat-pumps?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) to do the same; that proposal was approved in February. In the state Department of Public Utilities’ order launching the investigation into heat pump rates, regulators required Eversource to submit its own such plan by May 15 and committed to moving the proposal through the regulatory process quickly enough to make a new rate effective for the coming winter.
These lower rates are possible because utilities are essentially overcharging heat pump customers for their winter electricity use under the current system, said Mark Kresowik, senior policy director for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
On each utility bill, customers pay, of course, for the electricity they use. They also pay a delivery charge that funds the construction and maintainence of a grid that can accommodate moments of peak demand: those few hot summer evenings when dishwashers, televisions, and millions of air conditioners are running at the same time.
In the winter, though, average demand is much lower, so the strain on the grid is much lighter. During these months, the delivery charge doesn’t properly reflect the actual costs of keeping the grid running, said Kyle Murray, Massachusetts program director for clean energy nonprofit Acadia Center.
Households that operate heat pumps in the winter are “not actually putting much stress on the system at all,” he said. “They really shouldn’t have to pay as much as they are.”
## **Public input will help refine Massachusetts heat pump discounts**
A collaboration of state agencies, known as the Interagency Rates Working Group, 5-cent winter discount, compared to the existing rate, could slightly increase overall costs for a household switching from natural gas. A discount of 18 cents, however, would result in significant savings across the board: A house switching from natural gas could save up to $78 per month, and a home making the move from electric resistance heat could save more than $500 per month.
Though more numbers need to be crunched, energy advocates are inclined to support a deeper discount. Because of the high cost of electricity in Massachusetts, a larger rate reduction might be needed to make a heat pump a competitive choice, they said.
“You do need a pretty significant discount in some states to ensure that a heat pump is lower-cost than a gas furnace going forward,” Kresowik said.
As part of the investigation into seasonal heat-pump rate design, regulators have asked the public to submit comments by June 2. The approach to gathering feedback is a welcome departure from the usual process, Chretien said.
In most cases before utility regulators, outside organizations can only participate if they become formal intervenors and have a lawyer representing them. It is expensive, time-consuming, and beyond the reach of many advocacy groups and most individuals, Chretien said. The request for comments from any interested parties opens up the proceedings, he said, allowing anyone with a stake in climate or energy affordability issues to participate.
“The [Department of Public Utilities] is recognizing that their normal intervention process is onerous,” Chretien said. “To me, it’s good government to do it this way.”
For this approach to make a real impact, however, regulators must have a plan for reaching out to all communities, not just the narrow slice of people who are aware of public utilities regulations and issues, said Charles Hua, founder of consumer education nonprofit PowerLines. It will be important to connect with groups of different income and education levels, to ensure everyone has a voice.
“I would not expect in a vacuum that there would be awareness,” Hua said. “I suspect they need to proactively engage communities.”

A heat pump in Hudson, New York (Ysabelle Kempe/Canary Media)
States are ramping up efforts to get residents to switch from fossil-fuel-fired heating systems to all-electric heat pumps. Now, they’ve got a big new tool kit to pull from.
Last week, the interagency nonprofit Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, or NESCAUM, released 
California, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia together [committed](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/nine-states-pledge-to-boost-heat-pumps-to-90-of-home-equipment-sales-by-2040?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) to ambitious heat-pump adoption goals last year. Washington state joined the pact last week. Their targets: By 2030, heat pumps will make up 65% of the sales of residential heating, air conditioning, and water heating equipment. By 2040, that percentage is to climb to 90%.

Citing data from the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, a trade association, Levin said that in 2021, heat pumps accounted for about 25% of the combined shipments of gas furnaces, heat pumps, and air conditioners, the three largest reported HVAC categories. In 2024, they’d risen to about 32%.
“No matter how you look at it, there are still a lot of gas furnaces being sold, there are still a lot of one-way central air-conditioners being sold — all of which could really become heat pumps,” Levin said.
Produced in consultation with state agencies, environmental justice organizations, and technical and policy experts, the NESCAUM report lays out a diverse set of more than 50 strategies — both carrots and sticks — covering equity and workforce investments, obligations to reduce carbon, building standards, and utility regulation. A wide range of decision-makers, often in collaboration, can pull these levers — from utility regulators to governor’s offices, state legislatures, and energy, environment, labor, and economic development agencies. Here are six recommendations from the report that stand out.
  1. **Make heat pumps more accessible to lower-income and renter households.** A number of barriers need to be overcome to make heat pumps available to these groups, who often struggle to afford the appliances or lack the autonomy to install them. For example, contractors can’t put heat pumps in homes with hazards like mold, lead, asbestos, and rotten beams, but the process to address these problems can itself cost tens of thousands of dollars. Philadelphia’s 3% per year for up to 10 years after the project.
  2. **Set an all-electric standard for new buildings.** States have the ability to establish the minimum health, safety, and energy standards that developers must adhere to. New York recently became the first state to [require that most new buildings be electric only](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-free-buildings/new-york-finalizes-gas-ban?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd), making heat pumps the default heating appliances. The rules withstood a legal challenge in July and take effect on Dec. 31.
  3. **Use building performance standards to encourage heat pumps in existing structures.** Such standards require building owners to meet specific annual limits on energy use or carbon emissions and bring them down over time, or face penalties. 35,000 square feet or greater must report their CO emissions starting this year, hit standards by 2030, and fully ditch fossil-fueled appliances by 2040.
  4. **Leverage emissions rules that improve air quality and protect public health.** For example, in 2023, the San Francisco Bay Area air district, home to more than 7 million people, set landmark rules [requiring that new residential water and space heaters don’t spew](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/bay-area-officials-vote-to-ditch-new-gas-furnaces-and-water-heaters?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) health-harming nitrogen oxides, starting in 2027 and 2029, respectively. Heat pumps fit the bill. Switching to the tech nationwide could avert 
  5. **Push utilities to deliver clean heat.** States can require utilities to slash emissions and electrify buildings. For example, in 2021, Colorado adopted a first-in-the-nation 2024, regulators [greenlit a $440 million proposal](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/a-test-case-why-xcel-colorados-new-heat-pump-plan-is-a-big-deal?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) from Xcel Energy, the state’s largest utility, which included electrifying 2030. Maryland 
  6. **Reform electricity rates so that they incentivize zero-emissions heating.** Households with heat pumps tend to use more electricity than other customers, which means they pay disproportionately for fixed costs to maintain the grid on their energy bills. Utilities can correct that imbalance with adjusted rates. For example, Massachusetts has required its three major electric utilities to [offer discounted winter electricity rates to households with heat pumps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/massachusetts-winter-electricity-discount?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd). Elizabeth Mahony, commissioner of the state’s Department of Energy Resources, said she expects the new rates to save heat-pump owners on average $540 per year.


NESCAUM’s Levin stressed that the report is “a menu — not a recipe.” Each state will need to consider its own goals and constraints to pick the approaches that fit it best, she added.
Still, “I see [heat-pump electricity] rates as one of the areas that’s most promising,” Levin said. Massachusetts’ reforms “are really going to [change their customer economics](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/how-closing-the-spark-gap-can-boost-heat-pump-adoption?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) to make it more attractive to switch to a heat pump.”
When done right, rate design also avoids the need for states to find new funding. “You’re not raising costs on anybody, you’re only reducing costs,” Levin said. At a time when households are seeing energy prices [rise faster than inflation](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/electricity-prices-rising-trump-impact?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd), the tactic could have widespread political appeal, she noted.
NESCAUM plans to check back in with states and report out on their progress each year, Levin said. “The cool thing about our work is that we bring states together to learn from one another,” she added. “Part of making this transition happen more rapidly is lifting up the things that are really working well.”","Heat pumps, Carbon-free buildings, Electrification, Policy regulation",state-policy-strategies-hvac-electrification-nescaum_1.md,articles_heat-pumps

Jetson uses software to remotely size systems, meaning that the first time an installer comes to a residence is typically to put in the heat pump. (Jetson)
Heat pumps _can_ save households money. But the super-efficient, electric HVAC appliances are almost always more expensive to install up-front than gas- or oil-fired options.
“We are typically anywhere from 30% to 50% below competitive quotes,” said cofounder and CEO Stephen Lake.
The company’s name, which may resonate with certain “technology would enable this exciting, better future for us all,” Lake said.
His roughly 75-person startup, which Lake would only divulge has “raised a bit of money,” launched sales last October to try and deliver on that promise. So far, it’s installed [heat pumps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/a-beginners-guide-to-the-different-types-of-heat-pumps) — which can both warm and cool spaces — in nearly 1,000 homes in 
Today, Jetson is announcing a move it says will further cut costs: It’s rolling out its very own heat pump, the 
Whole-home ducted heat pump projects in the areas where the startup currently operates typically have a price tag of $25,000 to $30,000, Lake said, citing data from bids that customers routinely share with Jetson. Those prices are also about the 8,000 to $10,000) plus air conditioner ($3,000 to $5,000), Lake said.
Jetson says its average heat-pump installation cost is way less than the national average: just $15,000.
Many markets also offer thousands of dollars in heat-pump rebates, which the startup deducts from what customers pay out of pocket. In these spots, Jetson can offer heat pumps in some cases for as little as $5,000, Lake said. At that point, it’s a financial no-brainer to choose the electric equipment over a gas furnace.
Bringing down the up-front costs of heat pump adoption is crucial, especially in the U.S., where the federal government is [pulling back incentives for the HVAC tech](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/use-tax-credits-evs-home-before-gone). More than 80 million homes across the U.S. and Canada burn fossil fuels for heat, according to 3 to 6 metric tons of carbon emissions per household annually, Lake said, and heat pumps are the way to cut that pollution. Swapping a fossil-fueled heater out for a heat pump slashes CO about as much as 
## **A new business model to deploy heat pumps**
Jetson is taking a fresh approach to deliver its low heat-pump prices: vertical integration.
Traditionally, equipment manufacturers sell heat pumps to brands, which sell them to distributors, who sell them to HVAC installers, who sell them, finally, to homeowners, Lake explained.
“At each stage, there’s a markup,” said Brett Webster, a principal on RMI’s carbon-free buildings team. “There’s good reason to think that a vertically integrated company could reduce costs.”
Jetson cuts out the middlemen. It buys the heat pumps, stores them in its own warehouses, and has its own in-house installers ride out in the company’s electric vans to put the appliances in homes, Lake said.
Using custom software, Jetson also cuts costs by scoping heat pump projects virtually rather than sending someone out to each would-be customer. Last year, Jetson acquired [whole-home decarbonization startup Helio Home](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/electrifying-your-home-can-be-a-huge-hassle-helio-home-wants-to-help) and built upon its thermal modeling software that can accurately size heat pump systems remotely. In most cases, the first time an installer comes to an abode is to put in the heat pump. The company additionally uses proprietary software to process rebates.
Jetson’s tech-forward approach flows from Lake’s background. The Canadian entrepreneur previously built a smart-glasses startup called North that Google acquired for an undisclosed amount in 2020. With the climate crisis pressing and heat pumps an undersung solution, Lake and some of his colleagues from North pivoted to HVAC, he said.
Others are also developing software to improve the heat-pump customer experience. Manufacturing startup Quilt uses over-the-air updates to [Zero Homes](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-free-buildings/need-help-electrifying-your-home-startup-zero-homes-has-an-app-for-that), have created software to reduce the cost of heat pump projects.
In the view of RMI’s Webster, Jetson’s vertically integrated approach is “taking the next step.”
Jetson installed a heat pump for Matt Machado, who works as an expert on surface water and groundwater rights at Colorado law firm Lyons Gaddis, for a cost of about $7,000 — a third of what the eight or nine other contractors he got bids from offered. He’ll get another $2,000 off when he claims the federal “made it easy,” Machado told Canary Media. On pricing, “they’re very transparent.”
Jetson’s low cost was thanks in part to the company’s up-front application of state and local rebates, which tallied roughly $6,000, Machado said. Other contractors didn’t make these reductions, which would’ve left him to absorb the cost and file for the rebates on his own.
## **A souped-up heat pump**
With the launch of its heat pump, Jetson aims to provide a product that delivers the customer experience of a Tesla or Rivian electric vehicle, Lake said.
The Jetson Air heat pump is “comparable to the best models,” rated to work down to minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit, he added. Brands such as Bosch, Carrier, Lennox, and Mitsubishi already make popular 
What sets Jetson’s appliance apart, Lake said, are its built-in software, sensors, and controls. Homeowners can use these features to schedule their heat pumps to run at times of the day when the grid isn’t strained and power is cheaper. The tech also lets Jetson monitor a system’s performance and reach out if something needs to be fixed.
“What are the amperages being drawn? Is your air filter getting dirty? Are there any error codes coming up? Is anything not running 100%? We can tell all that remotely,” he said. No other heat pump on the market today is capable of that, he noted.
Ultimately, Lake said that these improvements in functionality compound into more savings for the customer.
HVAC “is this very unsexy category, which I love,” Lake said. “So many things we’re doing — applying software to make [products] more efficient and designing better systems — [are] improvements that in other industries have happened a long time ago.” But they’re “completely novel in this HVAC world.”","Heat pumps, Carbon-free buildings, Electrification",jetson-air-lower-costs-electric-home-hvac.md,articles_heat-pumps

Heat pump installation and other clean energy jobs are growing in the state. Can its workforce development efforts keep up?

_**Powering Rural Futures:** Clean energy is creating new jobs in rural America, generating opportunities for people who install solar panels, build wind turbines, weatherize homes, and more. [This five-part series](https://www.canarymedia.com/rural?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) from the Rural News Network explores how industry, state governments, and education systems are training this growing workforce._The sputtered drone of a vacuum pump filled the former milking barn that now houses Kennebec Valley Community College’s heat pump lab. Instructor Dave Whittemore, who held the yellow vacuum in one hand and displayed an app tracking atmospheric pressure on his phone in the other, explained in a raised voice how to do an “evacuation,” ridding the heat pump of air and moisture to avoid malfunctions down the road.
“The longevity of the equipment is important,” said Whittemore, who teaches students how to install the increasingly popular electric heating and cooling units. “If it’s not done right, then it’s going to fail prematurely. And that’s the biggest reason that I personally try to keep up with industry best standards and I pass that on to my students.”
Six years ago, Gov. Janet Mills traveled to the college to sign a bill aimed at transforming Maine’s market for heat pumps, an environmentally friendly alternative to oil furnaces and gas boilers, and set a goal of installing 100,000 units by 2025.
The state, now a national leader for heat pump adoption, met that goal two years ahead of schedule, and Mills once again traveled to the rural Somerset County campus to announce a new target: another 175,000 heat pumps by 2027.
Maine needs skilled workers to reach this goal, demanding training initiatives from all corners of the state to build HVAC, refrigerant, and electrical knowledge in the clean energy workforce. Without a strong pipeline, the state risks delays in reaching its heat pump target, putting its climate goals at risk.
So far, rural counties have seen some of the fastest rates of clean energy worker growth, according to KVCC is located, the number of clean energy workers has grown by 44% since 2020.
As part of this push, the community college launched a high-tech heat pump training lab in 2021 and has trained over 300 students. The initiative is one of many clean energy programs the school offers as part of a broader, state-supported effort to meet Maine’s goal of reaching 30,000 clean energy jobs by 2030.

Efficiency Maine, a quasi-governmental agency that oversees the state’s energy efficiency programs, has invested more than $400,000 in installation and weatherization training programs at KVCC and supports 29 similar programs at other institutions each year.
Another key piece of state support comes through the Governor’s Energy Office’s Clean Energy Partnership, which has awarded nearly $5 million in grants for clean energy training and apprenticeship programs across the state since 2022 and has seen over 3,500 participants. Businesses have also developed their own on-the-job training programs to help meet demand.
But the state still faces a daunting challenge: It must employ more than 14,000 new workers to reach its goal of 30,000 clean energy jobs by the end of the decade. Between 2019 and 2023, the number of workers in the field grew by less than a thousand.
While the state says it remains dedicated to this goal, some in the industry worry federal funding cuts and tariffs could create challenges for the workforce development pipeline.
## **Efforts underway in many corners of Maine**
Heat pumps have emerged as a pillar of Maine’s clean energy strategy: The units can reduce carbon dioxide emissions between 38% and 53% compared to a gas furnace, according to a  _,_ and have been touted as a way to reduce energy costs.
Rural areas have historically spent more on energy bills and participated less in residential energy and efficiency financing and rebate programs to lower costs, 
The demand for cleaner energy has grown not only in response to the state’s climate goals, but also as Maine’s electricity costs rise. A 2014 and 2024.
A Maine Monitor analysis of 2023 U.S. Department of Energy and Bureau of Labor Statistics data prepared for shows that two-thirds of the state’s clean energy jobs were in the energy-efficiency sector, while about a fifth of jobs were in renewables.
Workforce development has become a priority for the state as the clean energy industry grows, said Tagwongo Obomsawin, the program manager for the state’s Clean Energy Partnership, noting that it can provide good paying jobs for Mainers and reduce energy costs.
“Employers are definitely a really important part of the picture, but we don’t want to leave out anyone,” Obomsawin said. “We recognize that training providers, academia, state government, organized labor, and industry all have a role to play in making sure that we have a robust system that supports people in finding job opportunities, getting access to training, and localizing the benefits of the energy transition.”
Heat pump training is just one of several clean energy programs offered through the Maine Community College System, which includes KVCC. The system works with industry and state leaders to grow the workforce. The network of schools also trains students in electric vehicle maintenance, fiber optics, aquaculture, and more.

Dan Belyea, the system’s chief workforce development officer, said short-term training and scholarship funding are centered on needs that arise in the industry, which the schools gauge by looking at labor market data and talking to employers. Programs that are highest in demand tend to include electrical and heat pump training, Belyea said.
In 2022, KVCC hoped to use a nearly $250,000 grant from the Clean Energy Partnership to offer programs on electric vehicles and NABCEP solar photovoltaic installation. But trouble finding instructors and low interest among students made it difficult to launch.
Instead, KVCC doubled down on energy efficiency. It launched a building science program with the funding last fall, which had five students, two of whom were able to complete the certification. 
Other clean energy workforce initiatives have popped up across the state. Some employers run their own heat pump or solar installation training labs, and several adult education programs and nonprofits also offer classes designed to help people move into the industry.
PassivhausMAINE, a Freeport-based organization, received $180,000 in Clean Energy Partnership money in 2022 to host training programs on the state’s energy code. The company ran 29 trainings across the state, from Portland to Presque Isle.
Naomi Beal, executive director of passivhausMAINE, noted that getting enough students to attend the training was easier in areas like Portland but trickier in more rural areas.
“I always feel like it’s very important to consider when going into Greenfield or Machiasport or wherever that there are just not that many people. … So if we get five people showing up, that’s probably statistically way more interest than [a larger number of attendees] down in Portland,” Beal said. “We just try to be patient and persistent with the smaller towns and the smaller attendance.”
## **A need for more collaboration**
In Freeport, Scott Libby, the owner of Royal River Heat Pumps, walked through his training center as he explained that all his workers go through heat pump training that starts with the basics, regardless of experience, to ensure each worker is equipped to handle the job.
“A lot of these heat pumps have 12-year warranties,” Libby said. “That’s 4,380 days. The most important day is Day 1. It needs to be installed properly.”
Libby, who has worked with the U.S. Department of Energy on workforce development and sits on a new energy-efficiency workforce subcommittee being developed by the Governor’s Energy Office, said he’s aware of a number of different workforce development initiatives but that it’s difficult to comprehend how they all work together.
He said some forms of programming aren’t sufficient for what’s actually needed in the field: Students who sit through a six-week or six-month program that teaches the basics of how heat pumps work may come out with little to no hands-on experience with a power tool or climbing a ladder.

Libby emphasized the need for more collaboration between different workforce development efforts and a more systematic approach, with quality checks in place. He suggested putting more thought into designing industrial arts and home economics programs in middle and high schools to introduce students to different career pathways early on.
He also said more stringent licensing requirements could help with the quality of workers moving into the field. As it stands, there is no specific licensing required to install heat pumps in Maine, though workers need an Environmental Protection Agency Section 608 license to deal with the refrigerant used inside the unit, and an electrical license to complete the wiring.
He acknowledged that new regulation could “cripple” workforce development efforts but said the move is imperative to control the level of training workers receive and make sure everyone is qualified to install heat pumps. There are hundreds of contractors listed as qualified heat pump installers on Efficiency Maine’s website, a list he said in his opinion should be much shorter.
## **Uncertainties lie ahead**
At KVCC’s heat pump lab, Whittemore gestured at eight heat pumps mounted on prop walls used for training, listing the types of new units he hopes to get soon — ideally through donations from companies who have given units in the past.
Regulatory 
“Most of the procedures with the new refrigerants are the same. It’s just that we can’t put this new refrigerant in these existing heat pumps,” he said. “So I’ve got to get eight new heat pumps.”
The broader challenge he sees for the industry is tariffs, which he fears could lead to higher equipment prices and lower demand. This, in turn, could mean a lower need for workers. 
“I think that’s going to slow this down,” he said.

Maine has two years to reach its goal of installing 275,000 heat pumps and five years to reach its goal of 30,000 clean energy jobs. But uncertainties in building Maine’s workforce lie ahead.
The Clean Energy Partnership Project, which has funded many of the state’s clean energy workforce development programs, typically announces new grants in the summer, but the Governor’s Energy Office stopped short of committing to another round of funding this year.
“We can’t predict the future, but the existing programs that we have will continue on for at least another couple of years,” Obomsawin said.
She said a partnership the Energy Office has with the Department of Labor to provide career navigation services will continue into 2026, as will workforce development programs that received funding and are already operational. But she cautioned that it is still too early to know what impact policy changes at the federal level will have on the clean energy sector.
Efficiency Maine said that the state is still on track to achieve its heat pump goals — at least for now. Executive Director Michael Stoddard said that the heat pump rebate program has funding from the Electric Utility Conservation Program and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for at least the next three years.
However, some smaller initiatives, such as a revolving loan to help Mainers buy new heat pump systems, face uncertainty as the federal grants funding the project are in flux. 
Libby, of Royal River Heat Pumps, has 40 years of HVAC industry experience and said funding uncertainty will make it a challenge to reach the state’s heat pump goal.
“I think it’s definitely going to be harder,” Libby said. “I mean, I’m not ready to give up on it yet. I don’t think anybody is ready to give up on it.”

Equipped with the ability to work in reverse, they not only dump heat outside in the summer, but can also pull heat indoors in the winter.
Heat pumps do often cost a bit more up front, but if you’re on the hunt for a new AC system anyway, the difference can be small enough that it’s worth exploring the option. After all, you could end up with AC _and_ a shiny new heating system, to boot.

## **2. What’s the cost difference between a heat pump and an AC? **
It’s AC, home-energy marketplace EnergySage reports. But the general consensus is that heat pumps do come at a bit of a premium.
Here’s one example: In California, it costs between [$900 and $1,900](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/a-call-to-replace-air-conditioners-with-heat-pumps-in-california?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) more to replace a broken central AC with a heat pump instead of a conventional AC. That’s out of a median total heat-pump installation cost of $15,900, per data from the 2021 to April 2024.
But spending on a heat pump can mean avoiding the expense of getting a new furnace. Southern California’s air-quality agency recently found that installing a heat pump in a single-family home in the region typically [costs $1,000 less](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/socal-nox-emissions-appliance-rules?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) than installing a gas furnace and AC.
Across the U.S., heat pump installations HVAC equipment, can depend on a dizzying number of factors, including the size of your home, its energy demand, your local climate, the equipment efficiency rating, the state of your home’s electrical system, and how familiar your local labor market is with the product. 
## **3. What financial incentives are available for heat pumps?**
For now, there’s the 2,000 off your federal tax bill for a qualifying heat pump. But if Republicans’ “Big, Beautiful Bill” passes in its current form, that tax credit will disappear [at the end of this year](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/senates-big-beautiful-bill-would-be-a-disaster-for-clean-energy?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd). (All the more reason to get one this summer.)
Income-qualified households can check with their state energy office about the availability of Home Energy Rebates, an [$8.8 billion initiative](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-efficiency/inside-the-iras-historic-high-stakes-investment-in-energy-efficiency?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) created under the landmark 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Details vary by state, but [the law established](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/your-cheat-sheet-to-the-climate-laws-consumer-incentives?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) an $8,000 incentive for a heat pump, as well as rebates for enabling updates: $2,500 for electrical wiring and $4,000 for an electrical panel upgrade. While some state programs have rolled out after being finalized under the Biden administration, others still awaiting approvals

## **5. What else should I keep in mind before deciding whether to get an AC or a heat pump?**
Ideally, you don’t want to find yourself in the sticky and sometimes AC replaced in an emergency.

https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/massachusetts-winter-electric-rate-discount,Massachusetts heat pump owners could pay less for electricity next winter,16 April 2025,Sarah Shemkus,"The state’s high electricity prices are a barrier to heat pump adoption, so regulators are working with utilities to reduce rates in winter when demand is lower. 
A heat pump on a snowy winter day. (Admitter)
Nearly 3 million Massachusetts households will have the chance to start saving money on heating next winter under new seasonal heat-pump rates from the state’s three major electric utilities.
Regulators have approved plans from Unitil and National Grid to reduce electricity rates for heat pump owners during the region’s often-frigid winter months, and Eversource is preparing its own proposal. Together, the three utilities provide service to about 86% of Massachusetts’ households.
The goal of the rates is to accelerate adoption of heat pumps by making it cheaper to run these super-efficient, low-carbon appliances in a region where the economics of switching from fossil-fueled heating don’t always pencil out for homeowners.
“The end result, all over Massachusetts, is that this will change the numbers. It will encourage heat pump adoption,” said Larry Chretien, executive director of the Green Energy Consumers Alliance. “Then the question will be: What do we do for an encore?”
Utility regulators are already looking into that question, 
Expanding the use of [heat pumps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/a-beginners-guide-to-the-different-types-of-heat-pumps) is a major part of Massachusetts’ strategy for reaching its ambitious goal of going carbon-neutral by 2050. Today, nearly 80% of the state’s homes burn fossil fuels — natural gas, heating oil, or propane — for heat. Many of the remaining homes use inefficient electric resistance heating.
The state’s climate plan calls for installing 500,000 heat pumps by 2030 to tackle emissions associated with building operations. Air-source heat pumps, the most common version of the appliance, use electricity to extract thermal energy from the surrounding air to heat and cool homes. The only greenhouse gas emissions associated with the systems are those that come from generating the electricity used.
## **The economics of operating a heat pump in Massachusetts**
The persistently high cost of electricity in Massachusetts — only three states had 
Most households now using oil, propane, or electric resistance heating would likely save money by using heat pumps, regardless of electric rates. But for many consumers using relatively cheap natural gas, the added electricity use from switching to heat pumps would drive their total costs up. That’s where seasonal heat-pump rates come into play, charging lower prices to homes using heat pumps so the added power consumption [doesn’t translate into higher total energy bills](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/how-closing-the-spark-gap-can-boost-heat-pump-adoption).
Unitil was the first of Massachusetts’ three main investor-owned electric utilities to [put forth a seasonal heat-pump rate](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/advocates-hope-utilitys-winter-heat-pump-rate-discount-becomes-model-for-massachusetts-utilities), receiving regulatory approval in June for a discount of 7 cents per kilowatt-hour — 64% below the summer rate. Regulators then [ordered National Grid](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/mass-regulator-orders-national-grid-to-set-lower-winter-rate-for-heat-pumps) to do the same; that proposal was approved in February. In the state Department of Public Utilities’ order launching the investigation into heat pump rates, regulators required Eversource to submit its own such plan by May 15 and committed to moving the proposal through the regulatory process quickly enough to make a new rate effective for the coming winter.
These lower rates are possible because utilities are essentially overcharging heat pump customers for their winter electricity use under the current system, said Mark Kresowik, senior policy director for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
On each utility bill, customers pay, of course, for the electricity they use. They also pay a delivery charge that funds the construction and maintainence of a grid that can accommodate moments of peak demand: those few hot summer evenings when dishwashers, televisions, and millions of air conditioners are running at the same time.
In the winter, though, average demand is much lower, so the strain on the grid is much lighter. During these months, the delivery charge doesn’t properly reflect the actual costs of keeping the grid running, said Kyle Murray, Massachusetts program director for clean energy nonprofit Acadia Center.
Households that operate heat pumps in the winter are “not actually putting much stress on the system at all,” he said. “They really shouldn’t have to pay as much as they are.”
## **Public input will help refine Massachusetts heat pump discounts**
A collaboration of state agencies, known as the Interagency Rates Working Group, 5-cent winter discount, compared to the existing rate, could slightly increase overall costs for a household switching from natural gas. A discount of 18 cents, however, would result in significant savings across the board: A house switching from natural gas could save up to $78 per month, and a home making the move from electric resistance heat could save more than $500 per month.
Though more numbers need to be crunched, energy advocates are inclined to support a deeper discount. Because of the high cost of electricity in Massachusetts, a larger rate reduction might be needed to make a heat pump a competitive choice, they said.
“You do need a pretty significant discount in some states to ensure that a heat pump is lower-cost than a gas furnace going forward,” Kresowik said.
As part of the investigation into seasonal heat-pump rate design, regulators have asked the public to submit comments by June 2. The approach to gathering feedback is a welcome departure from the usual process, Chretien said.
In most cases before utility regulators, outside organizations can only participate if they become formal intervenors and have a lawyer representing them. It is expensive, time-consuming, and beyond the reach of many advocacy groups and most individuals, Chretien said. The request for comments from any interested parties opens up the proceedings, he said, allowing anyone with a stake in climate or energy affordability issues to participate.
“The [Department of Public Utilities] is recognizing that their normal intervention process is onerous,” Chretien said. “To me, it’s good government to do it this way.”
For this approach to make a real impact, however, regulators must have a plan for reaching out to all communities, not just the narrow slice of people who are aware of public utilities regulations and issues, said Charles Hua, founder of consumer education nonprofit PowerLines. It will be important to connect with groups of different income and education levels, to ensure everyone has a voice.
“I would not expect in a vacuum that there would be awareness,” Hua said. “I suspect they need to proactively engage communities.”

Takemura,"A new report offers more than 50 useful strategies for states to help residents replace fossil-fuel-burning furnaces and water heaters with cleaner heat pumps. 
A heat pump in Hudson, New York (Ysabelle Kempe/Canary Media)
States are ramping up efforts to get residents to switch from fossil-fuel-fired heating systems to all-electric heat pumps. Now, they’ve got a big new tool kit to pull from.
Last week, the interagency nonprofit Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, or NESCAUM, released 
California, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia together [committed](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/nine-states-pledge-to-boost-heat-pumps-to-90-of-home-equipment-sales-by-2040) to ambitious heat-pump adoption goals last year. Washington state joined the pact last week. Their targets: By 2030, heat pumps will make up 65% of the sales of residential heating, air conditioning, and water heating equipment. By 2040, that percentage is to climb to 90%.
The goals are essential for addressing climate change. Buildings are directly responsible for 
The NESCAUM action plan comes as the Trump administration [clings tenaciously to fossil fuels](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/coal-plants-trump-could-keep-open). In recent months, the federal government has [rolled back energy-efficiency standards for appliances](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-efficiency/trump-energy-star-liheap-building), imposed chaotic tariffs that are [put an early expiration date](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/use-tax-credits-evs-home-before-gone) on 
Despite these headwinds, the report shows that “states are still finding creative ways to move forward,” said Emily Levin, policy and program director for NESCAUM.
[HVAC heat pumps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/a-beginners-guide-to-the-different-types-of-heat-pumps) are routinely [two to four times as efficient as gas furnaces](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/heat-pumps-outperform-boilers-and-furnaces-even-in-the-cold), capable of heating and cooling interiors using the same physics that refrigerators employ to chill your cucumbers.

Heat pumps are slowly catching on. In the U.S., the units [outsold gas furnaces](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/heat-pumps-keep-widening-their-lead-on-gas-furnaces?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) by their biggest-ever margin last year, but their share of the market is still modest. Citing data from the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, a trade association, Levin said that in 2021, heat pumps accounted for about 25% of the combined shipments of gas furnaces, heat pumps, and air conditioners, the three largest reported HVAC categories. In 2024, they’d risen to about 32%.
“No matter how you look at it, there are still a lot of gas furnaces being sold, there are still a lot of one-way central air-conditioners being sold — all of which could really become heat pumps,” Levin said.
Produced in consultation with state agencies, environmental justice organizations, and technical and policy experts, the NESCAUM report lays out a diverse set of more than 50 strategies — both carrots and sticks — covering equity and workforce investments, obligations to reduce carbon, building standards, and utility regulation. A wide range of decision-makers, often in collaboration, can pull these levers — from utility regulators to governor’s offices, state legislatures, and energy, environment, labor, and economic development agencies. Here are six recommendations from the report that stand out.
  1. **Make heat pumps more accessible to lower-income and renter households.** A number of barriers need to be overcome to make heat pumps available to these groups, who often struggle to afford the appliances or lack the autonomy to install them. For example, contractors can’t put heat pumps in homes with hazards like mold, lead, asbestos, and rotten beams, but the process to address these problems can itself cost tens of thousands of dollars. Philadelphia’s 3% per year for up to 10 years after the project.
  2. **Set an all-electric standard for new buildings.** States have the ability to establish the minimum health, safety, and energy standards that developers must adhere to. New York recently became the first state to [require that most new buildings be electric only](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-free-buildings/new-york-finalizes-gas-ban), making heat pumps the default heating appliances. The rules withstood a legal challenge in July and take effect on Dec. 31.
  3. **Use building performance standards to encourage heat pumps in existing structures.** Such standards require building owners to meet specific annual limits on energy use or carbon emissions and bring them down over time, or face penalties. 35,000 square feet or greater must report their CO emissions starting this year, hit standards by 2030, and fully ditch fossil-fueled appliances by 2040.
  4. **Leverage emissions rules that improve air quality and protect public health.** For example, in 2023, the San Francisco Bay Area air district, home to more than 7 million people, set landmark rules [requiring that new residential water and space heaters don’t spew](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/bay-area-officials-vote-to-ditch-new-gas-furnaces-and-water-heaters) health-harming nitrogen oxides, starting in 2027 and 2029, respectively. Heat pumps fit the bill. Switching to the tech nationwide could avert 
  5. **Push utilities to deliver clean heat.** States can require utilities to slash emissions and electrify buildings. For example, in 2021, Colorado adopted a first-in-the-nation 2024, regulators [greenlit a $440 million proposal](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/a-test-case-why-xcel-colorados-new-heat-pump-plan-is-a-big-deal) from Xcel Energy, the state’s largest utility, which included electrifying 2030. Maryland 
  6. **Reform electricity rates so that they incentivize zero-emissions heating.** Households with heat pumps tend to use more electricity than other customers, which means they pay disproportionately for fixed costs to maintain the grid on their energy bills. Utilities can correct that imbalance with adjusted rates. For example, Massachusetts has required its three major electric utilities to [offer discounted winter electricity rates to households with heat pumps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/massachusetts-winter-electricity-discount). Elizabeth Mahony, commissioner of the state’s Department of Energy Resources, said she expects the new rates to save heat-pump owners on average $540 per year.


NESCAUM’s Levin stressed that the report is “a menu — not a recipe.” Each state will need to consider its own goals and constraints to pick the approaches that fit it best, she added.
Still, “I see [heat-pump electricity] rates as one of the areas that’s most promising,” Levin said. Massachusetts’ reforms “are really going to [change their customer economics](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/how-closing-the-spark-gap-can-boost-heat-pump-adoption) to make it more attractive to switch to a heat pump.”
When done right, rate design also avoids the need for states to find new funding. “You’re not raising costs on anybody, you’re only reducing costs,” Levin said. At a time when households are seeing energy prices [rise faster than inflation](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/electricity-prices-rising-trump-impact), the tactic could have widespread political appeal, she noted.
NESCAUM plans to check back in with states and report out on their progress each year, Levin said. “The cool thing about our work is that we bring states together to learn from one another,” she added. “Part of making this transition happen more rapidly is lifting up the things that are really working well.”","Heat pumps, Carbon-free buildings, Electrification, Policy regulation",state-policy-strategies-hvac-electrification-nescaum.md,articles_heat-pumps

Regulators are deciding just how much to heed appeals like these. The South Coast Air Quality Management District is weighing NOx, the smog-forming byproducts of combustion, by limiting the sale of home gas-fired furnaces and water heaters. About 10 million of these fossil-fueled appliances are currently installed throughout the region, home to more than 17 million residents across Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties.
Although an earlier draft of the rules would have 
Now, the agency is proposing to allow manufacturers to gradually ratchet down the amount of gas equipment they sell so long as they pay nominal mitigation fees. Starting in 2027, manufacturers would be required to aim for a sales target of 30% for appliances that meet zero-NOx emissions standards, i.e., [heat pumps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/a-beginners-guide-to-the-different-types-of-heat-pumps?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) and [heat-pump water heaters](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/heat-pump-water-heater-sales-home-electrification?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd). The fraction would increase to 90% by 2036, but the rules would never require sales of gas appliances to actually stop.
Some advocates are still pushing for updates with stronger teeth, saying the proposed fees are likely too small to get manufacturers to comply. But over two years into a prolonged process that has only diluted the initial proposal, supporters are also urging the agency to get the rules done as soon as possible and lock in their considerable health and environmental benefits. The full board for the district is expected to vote on the rules on June 6.

“We fail to meet several federal air quality standards,” said Sarah Rees, deputy executive officer at the air district, the oldest in the nation. “We really need to take all actions that we can to reduce those emissions.”
Most NOx is from transportation sources, which are regulated by state and federal agencies. But 76,000 asthma attacks, 30,000 lost school days, and 130 premature deaths each year, according to the advocacy group Coalition for Clean Air and climate think tank RMI. The annual health costs total about $2 billion.
The district first set NOx emission limits on residential space heaters with Rule 1111 and residential water heaters with Rule 1121 in 1978. Regulators have progressively strengthened them over time, first beginning to consider the shift to zero-emission equipment in 2016.
Though the proposed updates to the rules don’t represent a wholesale shift to NOx-free units, they could still 6 tons per day by 2060. For comparison, the more ambitious rules, which included space heaters in commercial buildings, would have enabled the South Coast to eliminate 10 tons of NOx per day by 2054.
Still, 6 tons per day is “a pretty big chunk,” Rees told Canary Media. “It’s about 10% of all of the stationary source emissions [from every factory, refinery, power plant, etc.] in our region.”
The 25 billion from 2027 to 2053, including about 2,500 lives saved.
## **Zero-NO x emissions standards taking off**
Zero-NOx standards for new home appliances aren’t a new concept. San Francisco Bay Area regulators [adopted such rules](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/bay-area-officials-vote-to-ditch-new-gas-furnaces-and-water-heaters?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) in 2023, and the 
The trend is growing outside of California, too. Maryland is 2023, eight more states — Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Washington — 
The South Coast also has a recent history of health- and climate-aligned rulemaking. In 2023, regulators adopted a first-of-its-kind rule to [electrify large commercial bakeries and kitchens](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/new-california-rule-will-cut-carbon-from-baking-cheetos-chips-and-more?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd). In 2024, they passed another landmark rule to [electrify small industrial boilers and large water heaters](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/southern-california-adopts-landmark-rule-to-electrify-industrial-heat?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd).
However, this time, critics got the district to refrain from requiring new space and water heaters be electric.
Between September 2024, when the SCAQMD floated a zero-NOx standard, and February, the staff received over 200 70% opposed. Among the top concerns raised was affordability for consumers who would be required to buy heat pump equipment when replacing their furnaces or water heaters.
So the district added flexibility to the proposed rules in February. By mid-March, the district had received almost 2,000 letters, with 80% in support of emission-slashing rules. The two largest cities in the air basin, 
Yet the minority in opposition has remained unmoved. The Southern California Gas Co. — SoCalGas, the nation’s largest gas-distribution utility — the Orange County Business Council, the Central Valley Business Federation, and others claim that the current proposal maintains an unaffordable zero-emissions mandate. Several cite a

The district staff have presented this information at several city council meetings. “Even when we’re in those meetings and saying that there is no mandate, that there is choice … people get up right after and say, ‘This is a mandate,’” said SCAQMD Executive Officer Wayne Nastri at the March meeting. “That is a talking point.”
Moreover, several incentive programs already exist or will soon be available to 10,000 low- and moderate-income households in Southern California at no cost, according to advocates.
The SCAQMD is also launching the $21 million 
Additional Go Zero funding would come via the air-quality mitigation fees imposed by the rules. Manufacturers would be required to pay $100 for each gas-fired furnace and $50 for each gas-fired water heater they sell within the target limit, and higher fees for units exceeding that limit. In 2027, for example, manufacturers with more than 70% of sales coming from gas-powered equipment would have to pay $500 per unit over the target. Stakeholders expect manufacturers, all of which produce both gas and heat-pump equipment, to pass these fees through to consumers rather than absorb them.
Incentives are crucial, especially for low-income households, because heat pump appliances can cost more up-front than their gas counterparts, and the district’s staff don’t expect energy bill savings to make up for it. Installing a new gas furnace in the average single-family home currently costs $11,000 compared to a heat pump at $19,000, staff members estimated using data 1,400 _less_ than a gas furnace on average. 
## **Advocates call for more ambitious rules**
Advocacy groups including California Environmental Voters, Earthjustice, Evergreen Action, and the Sierra Club support the district’s current proposal to adopt heat pumps gradually and use mitigation fees to incentivize the market.
At the same time, they’re calling on the agency to adopt a faster timeline, a target of 100% zero-emissions equipment by 2037, and higher fees that reflect the real health costs imposed on the public when a new gas appliance is installed. Those would be $950 for a gas-fueled water heater and $3,300 for a gas furnace, according to NOx are $383,000 per ton.
The district’s staff have so far rejected these ideas because the costs are high, potentially creating too great a burden for homeowners who choose gas appliances, Heather Farr, SCAQMD’s planning and rules manager, said at the March 21 meeting of SCAQMD’s 
Although advocates want the rules fortified, they called on regulators at the March meeting to vote on them as soon as possible to avoid the risk of further erosion. A public hearing before the full governing board had originally been set for May but was pushed back to June to give the agency more time to communicate with the public.
“We need to put out some facts so that [the cities that appointed us] can get on board and not oppose this as we go forward,” said Larry McCallon, committee chair and mayor pro tempore of the city of Highland.
Los Angeles County supervisor Holly J. Mitchell, committee vice chair who opposed the monthlong delay, took issue with the notion that a regulatory agency responsible for public health should continue to drag out the rulemaking process. The district has already held over 100 stakeholder meetings, 10 public meetings, and over 30 presentations to cities and other groups.Mitchell, who was formerly a state lawmaker, said that in the state Legislature, “we heard thousands of bills a year where we came nowhere near 100 stakeholder meetings…. A bill might be heard in the Assembly twice, [in the] Senate twice, and it became law.”
“So I just want to state my deep concern at a trend this board appears to be succumbing to where, when the going gets tough, we delay a decision,” Mitchell noted. “We have a responsibility to do the actions that the people who live in our service area require of us.” _Love Canary Media and find our reporting valuable?

Massachusetts regulators are considering a plan to make heat pumps an obvious financial choice for most residents.
The state Department of Public Utilities is mulling a proposal to heavily discount electricity rates in the winter months for households with heat pumps, a move that could cut energy bills for more than 80% of residents who switch over to the efficient, electric appliance from fossil-fueled or electric resistance heating. For many of those households, the savings would amount to hundreds or even thousands of dollars each winter.
Massachusetts utilities already plan to lower prices for heat pump users starting this winter, but the proposal under consideration would mandate even deeper discounts in future years. The new rates could accelerate the adoption of heat pumps in Massachusetts and boost progress toward the state’s climate goals, proponents say.
And with President Donald Trump’s megabill [eliminating federal tax credits](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/tax-credit-changes-trump-law?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) at the end of this year for homeowners who install heat pumps, the approach is a timely demonstration of how states can drive heat pump adoption in the absence of federal support.
“We want to spread awareness of how helpful and commonsense this is,” Amanda Sachs, policy associate with electrification nonprofit Rewiring America, said during a webinar this week on seasonal heat pump rates. “Massachusetts is offering more than a pilot; it’s offering a playbook.”
In Massachusetts and other states with ambitious climate goals, transitioning residents from fossil-fueled heating to heat pumps — which can both warm and cool buildings — is a major strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the cost of buying and operating a heat pump has held back widespread adoption, particularly in areas like New England, where cold winters and high electricity prices collide.
“If we don’t figure out the affordability issues, we diminish the likelihood that we will reach our climate goals in Massachusetts,” said Jolette Westbrook, director and senior attorney for regulatory solutions at the Environmental Defense Fund.
Today, nearly 80% of Massachusetts homes are heated with natural gas, heating oil, or propane, and many of the remaining households use inefficient electric resistance heating. Slightly more than 90,000 homes in the state installed heat pumps using incentives from energy-efficiency program Mass Save between 2021 and September 2024. The actual total, including homes that did not use Mass Save programs, is likely higher. Still, the annual adoption rate will have to double in order for Massachusetts to meet its goal of deploying heat pumps in 500,000 homes between 2020 and 2030.
That, say climate advocates, is where seasonal heat pump rates come in.
## Making heat pump operation affordable
Under current default electric rates, roughly three in four Massachusetts homes switching from natural-gas heating to heat pumps would 30% of households making that move would see their total cost for a winter heating season go up more than $1,000, the report finds.
“You hear that heat pumps can’t compete with natural gas, because gas is cheaper. That bit of conventional wisdom is true,” said Switchbox’s executive director, Juan-Pablo Velez.
Massachusetts has already taken steps to start closing that gap with discounted electricity prices for homes using heat pumps. Regulators [approved the lower rates](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/massachusetts-winter-electric-rate-discount?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) proposed by two of the state’s investor-owned electric utilities, Unitil and National Grid, in June 2024 and February 2025, respectively; the third, Eversource, submitted its own proposed rates in April, and they are widely expected to be approved.
The planned discounts range from 4 cents to 7 cents per kilowatt-hour on the delivery portion of the bill — which pays for poles, wires, and other infrastructure — rather than the supply portion that pays for the electricity itself. The lower rate will apply to all of a home’s electricity usage during the winter heating season. Utilities will automatically sign up households that received incentives for heat pump installations through Mass Save, the state’s energy-efficiency program, and homeowners can also reach out to their power provider to enroll in the rate.
If Eversource’s rates are approved, Massachusetts will become the first state in which all investor-owned utilities offer a seasonal rate specifically for heat pumps, Sachs said. Other states have seasonal rates that also include electric resistance heating, or have individual utilities or municipal power companies that offer heat pump rates, she said.
Still, the state Department of Energy Resources, along with lots of climate advocates, doesn’t think the current plans go far enough. In January, the energy department filed a petition asking utility regulators to consider requiring even further discounts, as recommended by the state Interagency Rates Working Group, a collaborative effort of Massachusetts agencies that examines ways to modify rate design to accelerate decarbonization.
The discounts suggested in the filing range from 12 cents to 17 cents. At these levels, 82% of households making the switch to heat pumps would see lower winter energy bills, with median savings coming out to $687, according to Switchbox’s analysis. Roughly 30% of households switching to heat pumps would save more than $1,000.
“You end up with this situation where heat pumps end up being this huge engine of affordability for Massachusetts,” Velez said.
Some 20 comments have been filed in the case, with all but one supporting the even-lower seasonal heat pump rates. The only one in opposition is a joint filing by Eversource, National Grid, and Unitil that argues for the chance to implement and assess their initial seasonal rates before pushing them down even further.
## How do seasonal heat pump rates work?
Supporters of seasonal heat pump rates stress that the lower prices do not mean that heat pump users are being subsidized by everyone else. In fact, they say, the proposed rate structure is far more fair than the status quo.
“This is not a handout to heat pump owners,” said Kyle Murray, director of state program implementation for clean-energy nonprofit Acadia Center. “This is a fundamental issue of fairness.”
Here’s why: The delivery portion of an electricity bill pays for the construction and upkeep of the poles, wires, and other infrastructure needed to get power where it’s going. To determine how much to charge customers — and this is a bit of a simplification — the utility divides the total cost by the number of kilowatt-hours it expects customers to use. That number becomes the delivery rate.
However, the delivery infrastructure is built to accommodate the demand peaks that happen on the hottest days of summer, when millions of air conditioners turn on at once. In the winter, peak demand is only about 80% of the summer’s highest load, leaving plenty of room for heat pumps to plug in without causing an electron traffic jam or requiring additional infrastructure costs. It is, therefore, unfair to make heat pump users pay more when they aren’t adding costs, supporters of the seasonal rates argue.
“Our current system is purpose-built for our summer peak demands, allowing incremental use without additional costs,” said Austin Dawson, deputy director of energy policy, utility regulation, and offshore wind for the state energy department. “All told, the cost of energy in the winter is higher than it needs to be.”
The idea is that utilities won’t end up taking a financial hit, because the heat pumps use more electricity at this lower rate, keeping revenue steady. Individual consumers, however, save money by eliminating their need for pricier fossil fuels or by switching from costly electric resistance heating to efficient heat pumps.
However, seasonal heat pump rates are only a short-term solution. The logic supporting them only holds as long as the system peak occurs in the summer. Within about 10 years, New England is expected to ISO New England. By then, though, the utilities should have deployed advanced metering infrastructure, technology that allows the collection of more detailed data about a home’s energy use, which will inform new ways of designing rates — an evolution environmental advocates welcome.
“We can’t wait until we have those meters in place,” said Larry Chretien, executive director of the Green Energy Consumers Alliance, a clean-energy nonprofit serving Massachusetts and Rhode Island. “Our message here is: This is a great reform, but be ready. There will be more changes over time.”","Heat pumps, Electrification, Utilities, Northeast, Massachusetts",massachusetts-winter-electricity-discount_1.md,articles_heat-pumps

Heat pump installation and other clean energy jobs are growing in the state. Can its workforce development efforts keep up?

_**Powering Rural Futures:** Clean energy is creating new jobs in rural America, generating opportunities for people who install solar panels, build wind turbines, weatherize homes, and more. [This five-part series](https://www.canarymedia.com/rural) from the Rural News Network explores how industry, state governments, and education systems are training this growing workforce._The sputtered drone of a vacuum pump filled the former milking barn that now houses Kennebec Valley Community College’s heat pump lab. Instructor Dave Whittemore, who held the yellow vacuum in one hand and displayed an app tracking atmospheric pressure on his phone in the other, explained in a raised voice how to do an “evacuation,” ridding the heat pump of air and moisture to avoid malfunctions down the road.
“The longevity of the equipment is important,” said Whittemore, who teaches students how to install the increasingly popular electric heating and cooling units. “If it’s not done right, then it’s going to fail prematurely. And that’s the biggest reason that I personally try to keep up with industry best standards and I pass that on to my students.”
Six years ago, Gov. Janet Mills traveled to the college to sign a bill aimed at transforming Maine’s market for heat pumps, an environmentally friendly alternative to oil furnaces and gas boilers, and set a goal of installing 100,000 units by 2025.
The state, now a national leader for heat pump adoption, met that goal two years ahead of schedule, and Mills once again traveled to the rural Somerset County campus to announce a new target: another 175,000 heat pumps by 2027.
Maine needs skilled workers to reach this goal, demanding training initiatives from all corners of the state to build HVAC, refrigerant, and electrical knowledge in the clean energy workforce. Without a strong pipeline, the state risks delays in reaching its heat pump target, putting its climate goals at risk.
So far, rural counties have seen some of the fastest rates of clean energy worker growth, according to KVCC is located, the number of clean energy workers has grown by 44% since 2020.
As part of this push, the community college launched a high-tech heat pump training lab in 2021 and has trained over 300 students. The initiative is one of many clean energy programs the school offers as part of a broader, state-supported effort to meet Maine’s goal of reaching 30,000 clean energy jobs by 2030.

Efficiency Maine, a quasi-governmental agency that oversees the state’s energy efficiency programs, has invested more than $400,000 in installation and weatherization training programs at KVCC and supports 29 similar programs at other institutions each year.
Another key piece of state support comes through the Governor’s Energy Office’s Clean Energy Partnership, which has awarded nearly $5 million in grants for clean energy training and apprenticeship programs across the state since 2022 and has seen over 3,500 participants. Businesses have also developed their own on-the-job training programs to help meet demand.
But the state still faces a daunting challenge: It must employ more than 14,000 new workers to reach its goal of 30,000 clean energy jobs by the end of the decade. Between 2019 and 2023, the number of workers in the field grew by less than a thousand.
While the state says it remains dedicated to this goal, some in the industry worry federal funding cuts and tariffs could create challenges for the workforce development pipeline.
## **Efforts underway in many corners of Maine**
Heat pumps have emerged as a pillar of Maine’s clean energy strategy: The units can reduce carbon dioxide emissions between 38% and 53% compared to a gas furnace, according to a  _,_ and have been touted as a way to reduce energy costs.
Rural areas have historically spent more on energy bills and participated less in residential energy and efficiency financing and rebate programs to lower costs, 
The demand for cleaner energy has grown not only in response to the state’s climate goals, but also as Maine’s electricity costs rise. A 2014 and 2024.
A Maine Monitor analysis of 2023 U.S. Department of Energy and Bureau of Labor Statistics data prepared for shows that two-thirds of the state’s clean energy jobs were in the energy-efficiency sector, while about a fifth of jobs were in renewables.
Workforce development has become a priority for the state as the clean energy industry grows, said Tagwongo Obomsawin, the program manager for the state’s Clean Energy Partnership, noting that it can provide good paying jobs for Mainers and reduce energy costs.
“Employers are definitely a really important part of the picture, but we don’t want to leave out anyone,” Obomsawin said. “We recognize that training providers, academia, state government, organized labor, and industry all have a role to play in making sure that we have a robust system that supports people in finding job opportunities, getting access to training, and localizing the benefits of the energy transition.”
Heat pump training is just one of several clean energy programs offered through the Maine Community College System, which includes KVCC. The system works with industry and state leaders to grow the workforce. The network of schools also trains students in electric vehicle maintenance, fiber optics, aquaculture, and more.

Dan Belyea, the system’s chief workforce development officer, said short-term training and scholarship funding are centered on needs that arise in the industry, which the schools gauge by looking at labor market data and talking to employers. Programs that are highest in demand tend to include electrical and heat pump training, Belyea said.
In 2022, KVCC hoped to use a nearly $250,000 grant from the Clean Energy Partnership to offer programs on electric vehicles and NABCEP solar photovoltaic installation. But trouble finding instructors and low interest among students made it difficult to launch.
Instead, KVCC doubled down on energy efficiency. It launched a building science program with the funding last fall, which had five students, two of whom were able to complete the certification. 
Other clean energy workforce initiatives have popped up across the state. Some employers run their own heat pump or solar installation training labs, and several adult education programs and nonprofits also offer classes designed to help people move into the industry.
PassivhausMAINE, a Freeport-based organization, received $180,000 in Clean Energy Partnership money in 2022 to host training programs on the state’s energy code. The company ran 29 trainings across the state, from Portland to Presque Isle.
Naomi Beal, executive director of passivhausMAINE, noted that getting enough students to attend the training was easier in areas like Portland but trickier in more rural areas.
“I always feel like it’s very important to consider when going into Greenfield or Machiasport or wherever that there are just not that many people. … So if we get five people showing up, that’s probably statistically way more interest than [a larger number of attendees] down in Portland,” Beal said. “We just try to be patient and persistent with the smaller towns and the smaller attendance.”
## **A need for more collaboration**
In Freeport, Scott Libby, the owner of Royal River Heat Pumps, walked through his training center as he explained that all his workers go through heat pump training that starts with the basics, regardless of experience, to ensure each worker is equipped to handle the job.
“A lot of these heat pumps have 12-year warranties,” Libby said. “That’s 4,380 days. The most important day is Day 1. It needs to be installed properly.”
Libby, who has worked with the U.S. Department of Energy on workforce development and sits on a new energy-efficiency workforce subcommittee being developed by the Governor’s Energy Office, said he’s aware of a number of different workforce development initiatives but that it’s difficult to comprehend how they all work together.
He said some forms of programming aren’t sufficient for what’s actually needed in the field: Students who sit through a six-week or six-month program that teaches the basics of how heat pumps work may come out with little to no hands-on experience with a power tool or climbing a ladder.

Libby emphasized the need for more collaboration between different workforce development efforts and a more systematic approach, with quality checks in place. He suggested putting more thought into designing industrial arts and home economics programs in middle and high schools to introduce students to different career pathways early on.
He also said more stringent licensing requirements could help with the quality of workers moving into the field. As it stands, there is no specific licensing required to install heat pumps in Maine, though workers need an Environmental Protection Agency Section 608 license to deal with the refrigerant used inside the unit, and an electrical license to complete the wiring.
He acknowledged that new regulation could “cripple” workforce development efforts but said the move is imperative to control the level of training workers receive and make sure everyone is qualified to install heat pumps. There are hundreds of contractors listed as qualified heat pump installers on Efficiency Maine’s website, a list he said in his opinion should be much shorter.
## **Uncertainties lie ahead**
At KVCC’s heat pump lab, Whittemore gestured at eight heat pumps mounted on prop walls used for training, listing the types of new units he hopes to get soon — ideally through donations from companies who have given units in the past.
Regulatory 
“Most of the procedures with the new refrigerants are the same. It’s just that we can’t put this new refrigerant in these existing heat pumps,” he said. “So I’ve got to get eight new heat pumps.”
The broader challenge he sees for the industry is tariffs, which he fears could lead to higher equipment prices and lower demand. This, in turn, could mean a lower need for workers. 
“I think that’s going to slow this down,” he said.

Maine has two years to reach its goal of installing 275,000 heat pumps and five years to reach its goal of 30,000 clean energy jobs. But uncertainties in building Maine’s workforce lie ahead.
The Clean Energy Partnership Project, which has funded many of the state’s clean energy workforce development programs, typically announces new grants in the summer, but the Governor’s Energy Office stopped short of committing to another round of funding this year.
“We can’t predict the future, but the existing programs that we have will continue on for at least another couple of years,” Obomsawin said.
She said a partnership the Energy Office has with the Department of Labor to provide career navigation services will continue into 2026, as will workforce development programs that received funding and are already operational. But she cautioned that it is still too early to know what impact policy changes at the federal level will have on the clean energy sector.
Efficiency Maine said that the state is still on track to achieve its heat pump goals — at least for now. Executive Director Michael Stoddard said that the heat pump rebate program has funding from the Electric Utility Conservation Program and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for at least the next three years.
However, some smaller initiatives, such as a revolving loan to help Mainers buy new heat pump systems, face uncertainty as the federal grants funding the project are in flux. 
Libby, of Royal River Heat Pumps, has 40 years of HVAC industry experience and said funding uncertainty will make it a challenge to reach the state’s heat pump goal.
“I think it’s definitely going to be harder,” Libby said. “I mean, I’m not ready to give up on it yet. I don’t think anybody is ready to give up on it.”

Takemura,"The Vancouver-based Jetson has a simple cost-cutting formula: lots of tech, no middlemen. Today, it’s launching its own heat pump product. 
Jetson uses software to remotely size systems, meaning that the first time an installer comes to a residence is typically to put in the heat pump. (Jetson)
Heat pumps _can_ save households money. But the super-efficient, electric HVAC appliances are almost always more expensive to install up-front than gas- or oil-fired options.
“We are typically anywhere from 30% to 50% below competitive quotes,” said cofounder and CEO Stephen Lake.
The company’s name, which may resonate with certain “technology would enable this exciting, better future for us all,” Lake said.

Today, Jetson is announcing a move it says will further cut costs: It’s rolling out its very own heat pump, the 
Whole-home ducted heat pump projects in the areas where the startup currently operates typically have a price tag of $25,000 to $30,000, Lake said, citing data from bids that customers routinely share with Jetson. Those prices are also about the 8,000 to $10,000) plus air conditioner ($3,000 to $5,000), Lake said.
Jetson says its average heat-pump installation cost is way less than the national average: just $15,000.
Many markets also offer thousands of dollars in heat-pump rebates, which the startup deducts from what customers pay out of pocket. In these spots, Jetson can offer heat pumps in some cases for as little as $5,000, Lake said. At that point, it’s a financial no-brainer to choose the electric equipment over a gas furnace.
Bringing down the up-front costs of heat pump adoption is crucial, especially in the U.S., where the federal government is [pulling back incentives for the HVAC tech](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/use-tax-credits-evs-home-before-gone?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd). More than 80 million homes across the U.S. and Canada burn fossil fuels for heat, according to 3 to 6 metric tons of carbon emissions per household annually, Lake said, and heat pumps are the way to cut that pollution. Swapping a fossil-fueled heater out for a heat pump slashes CO about as much as 
## **A new business model to deploy heat pumps**
Jetson is taking a fresh approach to deliver its low heat-pump prices: vertical integration.
Traditionally, equipment manufacturers sell heat pumps to brands, which sell them to distributors, who sell them to HVAC installers, who sell them, finally, to homeowners, Lake explained.
“At each stage, there’s a markup,” said Brett Webster, a principal on RMI’s carbon-free buildings team. “There’s good reason to think that a vertically integrated company could reduce costs.”
Jetson cuts out the middlemen. It buys the heat pumps, stores them in its own warehouses, and has its own in-house installers ride out in the company’s electric vans to put the appliances in homes, Lake said.
Using custom software, Jetson also cuts costs by scoping heat pump projects virtually rather than sending someone out to each would-be customer. Last year, Jetson acquired [whole-home decarbonization startup Helio Home](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/electrifying-your-home-can-be-a-huge-hassle-helio-home-wants-to-help?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd) and built upon its thermal modeling software that can accurately size heat pump systems remotely. In most cases, the first time an installer comes to an abode is to put in the heat pump. The company additionally uses proprietary software to process rebates.
Jetson’s tech-forward approach flows from Lake’s background. The Canadian entrepreneur previously built a smart-glasses startup called North that Google acquired for an undisclosed amount in 2020. With the climate crisis pressing and heat pumps an undersung solution, Lake and some of his colleagues from North pivoted to HVAC, he said.
Others are also developing software to improve the heat-pump customer experience. Manufacturing startup Quilt uses over-the-air updates to [Zero Homes](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-free-buildings/need-help-electrifying-your-home-startup-zero-homes-has-an-app-for-that?token=7T7NVQzUogtyz14Tpy9W1LlvaFw6DcMo&x-craft-preview=c7300162e48ab43273868a7b3f5ecaa402aafde4ba956688deb6d8861ae855a1xsntwafsjd), have created software to reduce the cost of heat pump projects.
In the view of RMI’s Webster, Jetson’s vertically integrated approach is “taking the next step.”
Jetson installed a heat pump for Matt Machado, who works as an expert on surface water and groundwater rights at Colorado law firm Lyons Gaddis, for a cost of about $7,000 — a third of what the eight or nine other contractors he got bids from offered. He’ll get another $2,000 off when he claims the federal “made it easy,” Machado told Canary Media. On pricing, “they’re very transparent.”
Jetson’s low cost was thanks in part to the company’s up-front application of state and local rebates, which tallied roughly $6,000, Machado said. Other contractors didn’t make these reductions, which would’ve left him to absorb the cost and file for the rebates on his own.
## **A souped-up heat pump**
With the launch of its heat pump, Jetson aims to provide a product that delivers the customer experience of a Tesla or Rivian electric vehicle, Lake said.
The Jetson Air heat pump is “comparable to the best models,” rated to work down to minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit, he added. Brands such as Bosch, Carrier, Lennox, and Mitsubishi already make popular 
What sets Jetson’s appliance apart, Lake said, are its built-in software, sensors, and controls. Homeowners can use these features to schedule their heat pumps to run at times of the day when the grid isn’t strained and power is cheaper. The tech also lets Jetson monitor a system’s performance and reach out if something needs to be fixed.
“What are the amperages being drawn? Is your air filter getting dirty? Are there any error codes coming up? Is anything not running 100%? We can tell all that remotely,” he said. No other heat pump on the market today is capable of that, he noted.
Ultimately, Lake said that these improvements in functionality compound into more savings for the customer.
HVAC “is this very unsexy category, which I love,” Lake said. “So many things we’re doing — applying software to make [products] more efficient and designing better systems — [are] improvements that in other industries have happened a long time ago.” But they’re “completely novel in this HVAC world.”","Heat pumps, Carbon-free buildings, Electrification",jetson-air-lower-costs-electric-home-hvac_1.md,articles_heat-pumps

ComEd is training them.,1 May 2025,Audrey Henderson,"The utility’s Academy programs are helping women and people of color start careers in clean energy. A new crop of workers just graduated.

Illinois is going to need a whole lot more workers to realize its clean energy aspirations.
The state has some of the nation’s most ambitious climate laws, with a target of transitioning to 100% clean energy by 2050. In 2030 — just five years from now — it aims to achieve 40% renewable energy.
The shift away from fossil fuels could 2022 study commissioned by ComEd, the state’s largest utility.
Since 2012, ComEd has offered a suite of what it calls “Academy” 1,000 residents from in and around Chicago for entry-level positions in the construction, utility, and clean energy fields.
“We are delivering clean energy 24/7, 365 [days a year] — reliable power to 9 million people across Northern Illinois,” Laticia Holbert, senior workforce development manager for ComEd, told Canary Media. “And so it’s our duty to make sure that we are working with our communities to get a talent pipeline. We are proud of the legacy that we have done throughout our training programs, and we continue to expand.”
The goal of the programs is two-fold — not only to increase the size of the workforce but also to provide employment opportunities for members of environmental justice communities, who for decades have borne the brunt of adverse effects from fossil-fuel extraction. Training programs aimed at these groups, advocates point out, help to ensure that the clean energy transition does not perpetuate the injustices of the fossil-fuel economy.
“We are partnering with the community to make sure that we’re bringing in a diverse talent pipeline, by delivering targeted programs to ensure that more local residents are prepared for, I like to say, good-paying jobs [with] family-sustaining wages,” Holbert said. “We know that is really critical for our communities. We know, with the current climate [and] how clean energy is really revolutionizing, how we need to look at the demand for jobs.”
In mid-April, ComEd and a coalition of companies, labor organizations, and community groups celebrated 73 new graduates from two of the utility’s job training programs, Construct Infrastructure Academy and Craft Academy, at the University of Illinois Chicago Forum. U.S. Rep. Danny K. Davis (D) spoke at the event, as did the CEO of ComEd and representatives of the company United Scrap Metal and the nonprofit Chicago Urban League.
Britney Evans, a 2025 graduate of ComEd’s Construct program who spoke at the ceremony, said that the training she received sets her up to succeed in the trades.
“From the build day to the job shadows and coursework, the Construct program gave me the boost I needed to build my professional network, be challenged, and find new opportunities,” Evans said. “It really helped me understand the daily realities and benefits of the construction industry, and now my classmates and I will be able to break through all the glass ceilings and advance further in our lives and careers.”
People of color make up more than 90% of the 2025 class of graduates from ComEd's Construct Infrastructure Academy and Craft Academy. Nearly 20% of this year's graduates are women. (Big Shoulders Digital Video Productions/Jim Vincent)
Another of ComEd’s Academy training programs, which was not represented at the event, is the 2023 in 14-week Power Up Academy program is designed to remove barriers to entry for local residents pursuing engineering-related careers. The program attained accreditation in 2024, enabling past and future participants to qualify for up to 13 credit hours toward future degree programs.
Each of ComEd’s three programs provides training at no charge to participants, along with a stipend during the program and ongoing career guidance and financial support after completion, Holbert said.
Approximately 70% of graduates across all of ComEd’s Academy programs land in entry-level positions with the utility or its more than 40 partner employers, taking on roles such as project coordinators, construction workers, lineworkers, design technicians, and underground locators, who help identify where infrastructure is buried.
Historically, more than 95% of program participants have been people of color, and 25% have been women. This year’s class of graduates is comprised of more than 90% people of color and nearly 20% women, according to ComEd.
Participants must be at least 18 years old, have earned either a high school diploma or GED certificate, demonstrate 10th-grade-level math and reading skills, and hold a valid driver’s license, Holbert said.
ComEd also requires potential students to complete an admissions interview along with a drug test and background check. However, individuals with past drug use or who were formerly incarcerated are not automatically disqualified. Consideration is made on a case-by-case basis, Holbert said.
“So, for 
Of the 73 participants who graduated in April, 64 had taken part in the Construct Infrastructure Academy. During the 11-week program, participants learned basic construction skills and earned industry certifications such as a commercial driver’s license and Occupational Safety and Health Administration training. They also learned about heat pumps, induction stoves, and solar panels.
Participants also had the opportunity to shadow and learn from industry partners. For instance, in partnership with Habitat for Humanity of Chicago, this year’s Construct students helped build homes across Chicagoland’s South and Southwest Sides as part of their training curriculum. During a recent Habitat for Humanity Chicago Build Day, they tiled bathrooms, hung kitchen cabinets, added trim and molding, and painted walls. The project allowed participants to apply their newfound knowledge on safety techniques, handling basic hand tools, and working as a team.
Meanwhile, the nine Craft Academy graduates completed a physically demanding six-week training program that requires utility-pole climbing, a prerequisite experience for an apprenticeship to become an overhead lineworker. Overhead lineworkers play a critical role in maintaining and modernizing the power grid. That task is essential for meeting rising electricity demands as people purchase more EVs and electrify their homes and businesses. These graduates are now eligible for scholarships to the Dawson Technical Institute Overhead Electrical Line Worker program of the City Colleges of Chicago, which will enable them to pursue careers in the electric utility industry.
“We are honored to have joined forces with ComEd over the last 13 years in connecting members of our communities to training opportunities that can change the trajectory of their lives,” said Chicago Urban League CEO Karen Freeman-Wilson during the graduation ceremony. “The Construct and Craft programs represent a gateway to lucrative jobs that can provide the chance to build lasting careers and generational wealth.”
ComEd uses money from its own budget to run the training programs, Holbert said. No federal funds are involved.
“I don’t think [the present political climate] has any impact at all because we have to hire people to work on our grid, our system,” she said. “So we need talented people. That’s just what our mission is. So nothing’s changed about how we’re doing and what we’re doing.”
_A clarification was made on May 1, 2025: This story originally stated that Construct students learn about installing heat pumps, induction stoves, and solar panels. The students learn about this equipment generally but are not trained in installation. The story also originally said that about 70% of graduates from ComEd’s training programs are employed by the utility and its partners. It has been updated to clarify that this figure is for ComEd’s Academy programs specifically, not all of its training programs._","Clean energy jobs, Clean energy, Utilities, Workforce diversity, Midwest, Illinois",comed-academy-diverse-workforce-illinois.md,articles_clean-energy-jobs

Technical colleges are creating direct pipelines into the industry — and the number of available jobs is “crazy,” said one student who is about to graduate.

[This five-part series](https://www.canarymedia.com/rural) from the Rural News Network explores how industry, state governments, and education systems are training this growing workforce._
MITCHELL, S.D. — Matthew Pearson found a successful career in the wind energy industry purely by chance.
After graduating from high school in Vermillion, Pearson knew he didn’t want to pursue a four-year degree and instead scrolled through the list of majors offered at Mitchell Tech, one of the state’s four technical colleges.
“When I came to the wind energy program, I thought, ‘Well, that sounds kind of cool,’” Pearson, 28, recalled during a recent interview at Mitchell Tech, the only South Dakota college with a designated wind energy major.
He didn’t know it at the time, but he had stumbled into one of the fastest-growing, highest-paying trade fields in the state and nation.
While workforce shortages plague many industries and employers in the Rushmore State, great opportunities abound for skilled workers to build, operate, and maintain renewable energy facilities, including at wind farms. Meanwhile, strong partnerships between technical colleges, employers, and the 
Pearson obtained a Build Dakota scholarship that paid all tuition for a two-year wind technology degree, then spent about $15,000 to complete another two-year major in electrical construction. 
After graduation, he quickly landed a job wiring wind towers at locations around the country. He was initially paid about $80,000 a year, and after six years was making $127,000 plus a daily living fee of $140.
But now, with a fiancee and two children, Pearson is completing a circle by leaving fieldwork and returning to Mitchell Tech to become its only wind energy program instructor. 
Pearson said that in addition to teaching the skills needed to thrive in the renewable energy field, he’ll also share the good news about their job prospects.
“There’s been a steady uptick in the need for workforce,” he said. “When I would get to a jobsite, there would be three or four companies there, and they’d always come over and ask, ‘Hey, you want to come work for us instead?’”
## **77 % of state’s power from renewable energy**
South Dakota is among the top three states nationally in percentage of energy generated from renewable sources, leaving it well positioned to provide both jobs in the field and trainers like Pearson who will help meet demand for workers.
About 77% of the power used in the state comes from non-fossil-fuel sources, largely from water and wind, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The state has three solar farms but no plans filed for more.
Since the mid-1950s, South Dakota has generated significant energy from its four hydroelectric power plants on the Missouri River.

And over roughly the past 15 years, the state has seen a tenfold increase in wind energy production, according to the state Public Utilities Commission. That growth has created a healthy number of construction and maintenance jobs.
In 2009, the state had 190 turbines capable of producing about 350 megawatts of electricity. At the end of 2024, South Dakota was home to 1,417 turbines able to generate about 3,600 MW of energy. The PUC also approved a 68-turbine project with a capacity of 260 MW and a $621 million price tag near Clear Lake in March.
“We’ve had just a tremendous expansion of wind energy in South Dakota,” said Chris Nelson, a PUC commissioner. “Today, though, we’re in a little bit of a lull.”
The expected slowdown is due to a lack of transmission lines capable of carrying more power, most of which heads east out of the state, Nelson said.
Despite the infrastructure challenges, renewable energy still has a bright future, he said. Two nonprofit energy consortiums that manage the power grid in the upper Midwest plan to spend a combined $37 billion to expand transmission capacity, including in South Dakota, over roughly the next decade.
## **Two majors, 100% job placement**
At Lake Area Technical College in Watertown, students are offered two energy-related degree tracks, said President Tiffany Sanderson.
The energy technology major provides training in development and maintenance of energy systems, and the energy operations degree is aimed at managing an energy facility.
“In our energy programs, those are students interested in working with their hands and solving engineering or process-oriented problems,” she said. “They’re very mechanically minded and can figure out how to make sure power is produced reliably so people don’t have delays in service.”

During a recent tour of the technology labs, students used printers, developed and analyzed system efficiency, and worked on unique projects like a solar-powered ice fishing shanty.
The two programs have about two dozen students combined, Sanderson said. In the 2023 graduating class, 100% of all graduates were employed within six months, with average salaries of $65,000 a year in the technology major and $69,000 a year in operations.
“That is for their first jobs in the industry, so those are tremendous opportunities for a brand-new graduate with two years of college education,” she said.
## **“ Crazy” number of jobs available**
In May, Nathaniel Bekaert will become one of those new graduates from Lake Area Tech.
Bekaert, 28, grew up on a farm and came to the college after six years in the U.S. Army, which paid for almost all of his tuition, fees, and equipment costs.

After touring the Gavins Point Dam hydroelectric plant in Yankton on the Nebraska border and interning at the Big Stone Power Plant near the Minnesota border, Bekaert was sold on the idea of working as a mechanic in the energy field.
“The more you learn, the more you want to dive into it,” he said.
With his anticipated degree and work experience, Bekaert said he was recruited extensively by energy companies.
“The amount of energy companies coming in looking for workers is crazy, and you can’t really grasp how many companies are looking for energy students,” he said. “There are a dozen or more companies within 45 minutes from here that are actively looking for technicians and operators or people with some type of energy degree.”
As a native of the Watertown area, Bekaert has accepted a job close to home as a wind technician at the Crowned Ridge wind farm northeast of the city, where he will make $29 an hour plus a $5,000 signing bonus and a $200 annual stipend for work boots.
Crowned Ridge is operated by NextEra Energy, a Florida-based company that runs wind farms across the country. A recent check of NextEra’s website revealed 396 job openings, with 185 related specifically to wind energy.
“No matter what happens with fossil fuels, we can keep going [with renewable energy] and live off that, and it will benefit everybody in the world. And we won’t have to rely on another country,” Bekaert said of his career choice.
## **A systematic approach to workforce development**
The South Dakota technical school system, which also includes campuses in Sioux Falls and Rapid City, has developed a close working relationship with the energy industry to ensure students learn the right skills and employers can tap into a pipeline of well-trained workers.
Lake Area Tech officials go into local public schools to promote energy and other trade jobs starting in elementary grades, Sanderson said.

At Mitchell Tech, Clayton Deuter, the vice president for enrollment services, said the college now offers a one-year wind energy degree instead of a two-year program, a change made after energy companies said some skills taught in the longer program could be obtained on the job instead.
Deuter said the energy programs at Mitchell Tech are an easy sell to students and their parents due to the low cost compared to a four-year college and the availability of Build Dakota scholarships in which students get tuition paid if they work in South Dakota for three years after graduation.
Mitchell Tech also offers a dual-enrollment program to high school students so they can have a wind energy degree from the college in hand by the time they graduate.
“You think about return on investment, and here you can take one year in the wind turbine program and you can graduate and make $80,000 to $100,000 a year,” Deuter said. “With student loan debt being so crazy, you don’t have to bankrupt yourself financially and be tethered to a student loan payment when you’re trying to buy a house and start a family.”

One of the state’s biggest renewable energy employers is Marmen Energy in Brandon. The Canadian-owned company has 285 employees who build wind towers up to 300 feet tall that are shipped to wind farms nationwide.
Aimee Miritello, human resources manager, said the company’s relationships with high schools and technical colleges form a pillar of its worker recruitment strategy to overcome a nagging lack of workers in the trade fields.
“Historically for us that has been one of our best ways of getting qualified employees,” she said.
Marmen has expanded its South Dakota plant to accommodate what Miritello said has been a steady increase in demand for wind towers across the country.

Marmen workers, who include welders, painters, and other construction tradespeople, make a good wage, are offered one of the best benefit packages in the region, and have strong opportunities for internal advancement, she said.
“Plus, they’re a part of making huge wind towers, so their pride in that is pretty big,” she said.

Decatur has been losing factory jobs for years. A clean energy workforce hub promises renewal — and provides training for students from disenfranchised communities.

[This five-part series](https://www.canarymedia.com/rural) from the Rural News Network explores how industry, state governments, and education systems are training this growing workforce._
DECATUR, ILLINOIS — A fistfight at a high school football game nearly defined Shawn Honorable’s life.
It was 1999 when he and a group of teen boys were expelled and faced criminal charges over the incident. The story of the “Decatur Seven” drew national headlines and protests led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who framed their harsh treatment as blatant racism. The governor eventually intervened, and the students were allowed to attend alternative schools.
Honorable, now 41, was encouraged by support “from around the world,” but he said the incident was traumatizing and he continued to struggle academically and socially. Over the years, he dabbled in illegal activity and was incarcerated, most recently after a 2017 conviction for accepting a large amount of marijuana sent through the mail.
Today, Honorable is ready to start a new chapter, having graduated with honors last week from a clean energy workforce training program at Richland Community College, located in the Central Illinois city of Decatur. He would eventually like to own or manage a solar company, but he has more immediate plans to start a solar-powered mobile hot dog stand. He’s already chosen the name: Buns on the Run.
“By me going back to school and doing this, it shows my nephews and my little cousins and nieces that it is good to have education,” Honorable said. “I know this is going to be the new way of life with solar panels. So I’ll have a step up on everyone. When it comes, I will already be aware of what’s going on with this clean energy thing.”
After decades of layoffs and factory closings, the community of Decatur is also looking to clean energy as a potential springboard.
Located amid soybean fields a three-hour drive from Chicago, the city was long known for its Caterpillar, Firestone Tire, and massive corn-syrup factories. Industrial jobs have been in decline for decades, though, and high rates of gun violence, child poverty, unemployment, and incarceration were among the reasons the city was named a clean energy workforce hub funded under Illinois’ 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA).
Decatur’s hub, based at Richland Community College, is arguably the most developed and successful of the dozen or so established statewide. That’s thanks in part to TCCI Manufacturing, a local, family-owned factory that makes electric vehicle compressors. TCCI is expanding its operations with a state-of-the-art testing facility and an on-site campus where Richland students will take classes adjacent to the manufacturing floor. The electric truck company Rivian also has a factory 50 miles away.
“The pieces are all coming together,” Kara Demirjian, senior vice president of TCCI Manufacturing, said by email. “What makes this region unique is that it’s not just about one company or one product line. It’s about building an entire clean energy ecosystem. The future of EV manufacturing leadership won’t just be on the coasts — it’s being built right here in the Midwest.”
The Decatur CEJA program has also flourished because it was grafted onto a preexisting initiative, EnRich, that helps formerly incarcerated or otherwise disenfranchised people gain new skills and employment. The program is overseen by the Rev. Courtney Carson, a childhood friend of Honorable and another member of the Decatur Seven.
“So many of us suffer significantly from our unmet needs, our unhealed traumas,” said Carson, who was jailed as a young man for gun possession and later drag racing. With the help of mentors including Rev. Jackson and a college basketball coach, he parlayed his past into leadership, becoming associate pastor at a renowned church, leading a highway construction class at Richland, and in 2017 being elected to the same school board that had expelled him.
Carson, now vice president of external relations at the community college, tapped his own experience to shape EnRich as a trauma-informed approach, with wraparound services to help students overcome barriers — from lack of childcare to PTSD to a criminal record. Carson has faith that students can overcome such challenges to build more promising futures, like Decatur itself has done.
“We have all these new opportunities coming in, and there’s a lot of excitement in the city,” Carson said. “That’s magnificent. So what has to happen is these individuals who suffered from closures, they have to be reminded that there is hope.”
## **Getting students ready for the clean energy workforce**
Richland Community College’s clean energy jobs training starts with an eight-week life skills course that has long been central to the larger EnRich program. The course uses a Circle of Courage practice inspired by Indigenous communities and helps students prepare to handle stressful workplace situations like being disrespected or even called a racial slur.
“Being called the N-word, couldn’t that make you want to fight somebody? But now you lose your job,” said Carson. “We really dive deep into what’s motivating their attitude and those traumas that have significantly impacted their body to make them respond to situations either the right way or the wrong way.”
The training addresses other dynamics that might be unfamiliar to some students — for example, some male students might not be prepared to be supervised by a woman, Carson noted, or others might not be comfortable with LGBTQ+ coworkers.
Life skills are followed by a construction math course crucial to many clean energy and other trades jobs. During a recent class, 24-year-old Brylan Hodges joked with the teacher while converting fractions to decimals and percentages on the whiteboard. He explained that he moved from St. Louis to Decatur in search of opportunity, and he hopes to become a property manager overseeing solar panel installation and energy-efficiency upgrades on buildings.
Students take an eight-hour primer in clean energy fields including electric vehicles, solar, HVAC, and home energy auditing. Then they choose a clean energy track to pursue, leading to professional certifications as well as a chance to continue at Richland for an associate degree. Under the state-funded program, students are paid for their time attending classes.

Marcus James was part of the first cohort to start the program last October, just days after his release from prison.
He was an 18-year-old living in Memphis, Tennessee, when someone shot at him, as he describes it, and he fired back, with fatal consequences. He was convicted of murder and spent 12 years behind bars. After his release he made his way to Decatur, looking for a safer place to raise his kids. Adjusting to life on the outside wasn’t easy, and he ended up back in prison for a year and a half on DUI and drug possession charges.
Following his release, he was determined to turn his life around.
“After I brought my kids up here, I end up going back to prison. But at that moment, I realized, man, I had to change,” James told a crowd at an event celebrating the clean jobs program in March.
James said that at first, he showed up late to every class. But soon the lessons sank in, and he was never late again. He always paid attention when people talked, and he gained new confidence.
“As long as I put my mind to it, I can do it,” said James, who would like to work as a home energy auditor. Richland partners with the energy utility Ameren to place trainees in such positions.
“I like being out in the field, learning new stuff, dealing with homes, helping people,” James said, noting he made energy-efficiency improvements to his own home after the course.
## **How Illinois’ energy policy prioritizes equity**
Illinois’ 2017 Future Energy Jobs Act (FEJA) launched the state’s clean energy transition, baking in equity goals that prioritize opportunities for people who benefited least and were harmed most by the fossil fuel economy. It created programs to deploy solar arrays and provide job training in marginalized and environmental justice communities.
FEJA’s rollout was rocky. Funding for equity-focused solar installations went unspent while workforce programs struggled to recruit trainees and connect them with jobs. The pandemic didn’t help. The follow-up legislation, CEJA, expanded workforce training programs and [remedied snafus](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/aggressive-clean-energy-bill-would-push-illinois-to-100-renewables-by-2050) in the original law.
Melissa Gombar is principal director of workforce development programs for Elevate, a Chicago-based national nonprofit organization that [oversaw FEJA job training](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/can-legislation-create-equity-and-diversity-in-solar-jobs-illinois-hopes-so) and subcontracts for a Chicago-area CEJA hub. Gombar said many community organizations tasked with running FEJA training programs were relatively small and grassroots, so they had to scramble to build new financial and human resources infrastructure.
“They have to have certain policies in place for hiring and procurement. The influx of grant money might have doubled their budget,” Gombar said. Meanwhile, the state employees tasked with helping the groups “are really talented and skilled, trying their best, but they’re overburdened because of the large lift.”

CEJA, by contrast, tapped community colleges like Richland, which already had robust infrastructure and staffing. CEJA also funds community organizations to serve as “navigators,” using the trust and credibility they’ve developed in communities to recruit trainees.
Richland Community College received $2.6 million from April 2024 through June 2025, and the Community Foundation of Macon County, the hub’s navigator, received $440,000 for the same time period. The other hubs similarly received between $1 million and $3.3 million for the past year, and state officials have said the same level of funding will be allocated for each of the next two years, according to the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition.
CEJA hubs also include social service providers that connect trainees with wraparound support; businesses like TCCI that offer jobs; and affiliated entrepreneur incubators that help people start their own clean energy businesses. CEJA also funded apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs with labor unions, which are often a prerequisite for employment in utility-scale solar and wind.
“The sum of the parts is greater than the whole,” said Drew Keiser, TCCI vice president of global human resources. “The navigator is saying, ‘Hey, I’ve connected with this portion of the population that’s been overlooked or underserved.’ OK, once you get them trained, send their resumes to me, and I’ll get them interviewed. We’re seeing a real pipeline into careers.”
The hub partners go to great lengths to aid students — for example, coordinating and often paying for transportation, childcare, or even car repairs.
“If you need some help, they always there for you,” James said.
## **What’s next for Decatur and its clean energy trainees?**
In 1984, TCCI began making vehicle compressors in a Decatur plant formerly used to build Sherman tanks during World War II. A few decades later, the company began producing compressors for electric vehicles, which are 
In August 2023, Gov. JB Pritzker joined TCCI President Richard Demirjian, the Decatur mayor, and college officials for the EV chargers, batteries, compressors, and other components for testing in extreme temperatures, rain, and wind.
A $21.3 million capital grant and a $2.2 million electric vehicle incentive 2022, Pritzker 1 million EVs on the road by 2030.
Far from the gritty industrial environs that likely characterized Decatur workplaces of the past, the classrooms at TCCI feature colorful decor, comfortable armchairs, and bright, airy spaces adjacent to pristine high-tech manufacturing floors lined with machines.

“This hub is a game changer,” said Keiser, noting the need for trained tradespeople. “As a country, we place a lot of emphasis on kids going to college, and maybe we’ve kind of overlooked getting tangible skills in the hands of folks.”
A marketing firm founded by Kara Demirjian — Richard Demirjian’s sister — and located on-site with TCCI also received clean energy hub funds to promote the training program. This has been crucial to the hub’s success, according to Ariana Bennick, account executive at the firm, DCC Marketing. Its team has developed, tested, and deployed digital billboards, mailers, ads, Facebook events, and other approaches to attract trainees and business partners.
“Being a part of something here in Decatur that’s really leading the nation in this clean energy initiative is exciting,” Bennick said. “It can be done here in the middle of the cornfields. We want to show people a framework that they can take and scale in other places.”
With graduation behind him, Honorable is planning the types of hot dogs and sausages he’ll sell at Buns on the Run. He said Tamika Thomas, director of the CEJA program at Richland, has also encouraged him to consider teaching so he can share the clean energy skills he’s learned with others. The world seems wide open with possibilities.
“A little at a time — I’m going to focus on the tasks in front of me that I’m passionate about, and then see what’s next,” Honorable said. He invoked a favorite scene from the cartoon TV series “The Flintstones,” in which the characters’ leg power, rather than wheels and batteries, propelled vehicles: “Like Fred and Barney, I’ll be up and running.”

_**Powering Rural Futures:** Clean energy is creating new jobs in rural America, generating opportunities for people who install solar panels, build wind turbines, weatherize homes, and more. [This five-part series](https://www.canarymedia.com/rural) from the Rural News Network explores how industry, state governments, and education systems are training this growing workforce._
When Mason Taylor was getting ready to graduate from high school in 2022, he thought he would have to take an entry-level technician job with a company in Tennessee.
Taylor grew up in the town of Dryden in rural Lee County, in the westernmost sliver of Virginia between Kentucky and Tennessee. He had come to love the electrical courses he took in high school because there was always something new to learn, always a new way to challenge himself.
Driving to Tennessee for work would likely mean two hours commuting each day.
Taylor, now 21, just wanted to work close to home. 
A summer apprenticeship learning how to install solar arrays helped him get on-the-job training and opened up connections to local work.
A regional partnership working to add solar panels to commercial buildings in the region aims to train young people as they go, developing workforce skills in anticipation of increasing demand for renewable energy-focused jobs in the heart of coal country, where skill sets and energy options are both changing.
Virginia ranks eighth in the nation for installed solar capacity, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, but so far, major renewable energy projects have been clustered in the eastern and southern regions of the state. Increasing the popularity of solar power in the far southwestern corner of the state depends in part on the availability of trained workers like Taylor.
Andy Hershberger, director of Virginia operations for Got Electric, said the electrical contractor firm has had an apprenticeship program nearly since the company’s founding.
The company, which has about 100 employees total, with 40 in Virginia and an office in Maryland, has worked with Staunton-based Secure Solar Futures, a commercial and public-sector solar developer, as far back as 2012.
More recently, the two companies began working to set up a training program that was more focused on solar. The catalyst was the former superintendent of Wise County schools, a school division that had signed up to put solar panels on its facilities. The superintendent saw the installation as an opportunity to get his students hands-on work on a renewable energy project.
Approximately three dozen apprentices have signed up for the program since 2022, including about 13 who are currently involved, Hershberger said. They work on a variety of solar projects, including on rooftops, carports, and ground-mounted installations.
“We have been utilizing this program to train students coming out of high school and basically growing the workforce side of this thing, so we have the necessary personnel to build these solar projects long term,” Hershberger said.
On top of hourly pay, apprentices get free equipment and a transportation subsidy, along with nine community college credits at Mountain Empire Community College, which provides classroom training before students step onto the job site.
“I mean, pretty much everything you need to know to go out and do any electrical job, you pretty much learned in that apprenticeship program,” Taylor said.
He was in the 2022. A grant from a regional economic development authority paid the students’ wages while they earned credit at Mountain Empire Community College, which serves residents of Dickenson, Lee, Scott, and Wise counties, plus the city of Norton.
He got a job offer from Got Electric at the end of that summer.
This summer, Secure Solar Futures and Got Electric will join forces again to install more than 1,600 solar panels on the community college’s classroom buildings. The project was 
The 777-kilowatt solar power system will be connected to the electric grid, and Mountain Empire will receive credit for the power it generates.
Hershberger said he sees interest in solar growing.
“I think there’s always been folks that have adopted renewable projects, different types of energy sources. There’s always the standard interest in trying to save money for facilities and campuses and things like that,” he said.
Mountain Empire Community College offers solar training as a standalone career studies certificate or as part of its larger energy technology associate degree program.
In Southwest Virginia, a solar installation project is more likely to consist of adding panels to homes and businesses rather than building the large, utility-scale ground-based facilities more commonly seen in Southside Virginia, said Matt Rose, the college’s dean of industrial technology.
On a larger project, a single worker might have a specialized role, performing the same task across a large number of panels. On a smaller project, a worker is more likely to be involved in more aspects of the job.
“Our students need to have that comprehensive understanding and ability to be able to do it all,” he said.
Last year, 10 students graduated Mountain Empire with the solar installer certification. Many students who earn the certification perform solar installation work as one part of a more comprehensive job, such as being an electrician.
Rose said the college’s students typically start out making $17 or $18 an hour but can earn more as they become journeymen and master electricians. 
Nationwide, the median salary for electricians is about $61,000. 
In Lee County, population 22,000, the median household income is about $42,000.
The number of solar installers in Southwest Virginia is unclear. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn’t collect data on employment by technology, so residential solar installation companies are labeled as electrical contractors, along with all other electrical businesses, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
Tony Smith, founder and CEO of Secure Solar Futures, measures the success of the company’s apprenticeship program person by person. At an April event to celebrate the completion of the first phase of solar panel installation for Roanoke schools, Smith asked about several of the students from the 2022 cohort from Lee and Wise counties by name.
Smith said it’s tough to replicate the apprenticeship program at various school divisions. Doing so requires the work of individual school systems and the regional community colleges, instead of being able to pick up the curriculum from one area and apply it at the next project site.
And all the partners — Smith’s company, participating schools and installation firms — face some uncertainty for each project. It’s challenging to pinpoint the timing of projects so that students have the time to participate during the summer months, he said.

## **Solar training can give students a “head start on everybody”**
“The things I learned in the apprenticeship program I’m still doing day to day,” Anthony Hamilton, 21, said. He completed the eight-week apprenticeship in Lee and Wise counties in 2022 alongside Taylor. He didn’t think it would turn into a full-time job. He doubted anyone really wanted to hire a kid just starting college. He’s been with Got Electric ever since, working as an electrician primarily on commercial jobs. Hamilton’s solar experience has come in handy on recent installation projects at a poultry farm and at a YMCA facility.
Hamilton continued going to school at Mountain Empire and graduates this month with two associate degrees in energy technology and electrical. He’s also earned a handful of certificates in solar installation, air conditioning and refrigeration, and electrical fabrication, among others. With the nine credits he earned in the summer apprenticeship, he “already had a head start on everybody in the program.”
It wasn’t an easy journey, though.
He said he usually started his day around 6 a.m. and went to night classes after work that stretched until 9:30 p.m. Hamilton lives in Coeburn in Wise County, a 45-minute drive to the college campus. He’d get home late, then get up early and do it all over again. But his college was free through a local scholarship program that pays for up to three years of classes at Mountain Empire.
He’d like to stay with Got Electric and start preparing to take his journeyman’s license, which requires at least four years of practical experience on top of vocational training, plus an exam. From there, he’s got designs on moving up in the company and eventually becoming a master electrician.
On April 14, he was in the town of Abingdon, a few weeks into a three-month project installing a solar array at a large poultry farm that says it produces more than 650,000 eggs a day. The work so far entailed digging trenches and laying PVC pipe for the ground-mount solar system that will span one section of the farm’s expansive fields.
Taylor uses similar skills at work each day. But his work site looks a lot different from Hamilton’s.
It has taken Taylor some time to figure out how to stick close to home while working in his trade. He spent a year working with Got Electric immediately after finishing his summer apprenticeship, then left the company to work as an electrician in a local school system. He eventually returned to Got Electric for a few months, working at Virginia Tech putting solar on three buildings on campus in Blacksburg, three hours from home.
He discovered he didn’t like traveling for installation jobs that meant night after night in a motel room.
“That was the only complaint I had with it, about being away from home,” he said. 
Now he’s an electrician at a state prison in Big Stone Gap. He has the same shift every day, in the same place, and drives 10 minutes home from work at the end of the day.
Taylor has also taken additional classes at Mountain Empire and wants to go back this fall to finish his associate degrees in HVAC and electrical. He eventually wants to open his own business as an electrician working locally. He’d like to be able to do small solar installation jobs. Solar hasn’t really caught on in far Southwest Virginia, he said — at least, not yet.
Rose, the dean at Mountain Empire, noted that once major solar projects are done, maintenance doesn’t require ongoing jobs, and most students who receive training in solar installation typically make it part of another job, such as being an electrician.
“We’re starting to see a lot more homeowners interested in [solar] locally as a way to offset increasing energy costs, but overall most of it is just a component of the job because there’s not enough demand,” Rose said.
Rose predicts interest in solar will grow as more homeowners and business owners look for ways to offset rising electric bills.
“As we all look at increasing energy costs, it’s going to make a lot more economic sense,” he said.
Energy independence, he added, fits with the character of Southwest Virginia.
“We’ve always been resilient people,” Rose said. “We’ve always been adapt-and-overcome people, and what better way than to basically control a little bit of your own power?”

https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-jobs/north-carolina-bill-duke-impact,Energy bill could cost North Carolina billions in lost investments and jobs,25 July 2025,Elizabeth Ouzts,"As lawmakers decide whether to override the governor’s veto of SB 266, new research estimates the massive economic toll of the legislation. 
Under SB 266, North Carolina would lose out on about 36,200 solar-related jobs each year between 2030 and 2035, researchers say. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)
A controversial bill to unravel North Carolina’s climate law would cost the state more than 50,000 jobs annually and cause tens of billions of dollars in lost investments, a [veto of the measure](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/emissions-reduction/north-carolina-bill-slow-energy-construction) by Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat.
First passed by the Senate in March, the wide-ranging 2030 deadline by which utility Duke Energy must curb its climate pollution 70% compared to 2005 levels. It leaves intact a mandate that the company achieve carbon neutrality by midcentury.
Senate leader Phil Berger, a 13-term Republican from Rockingham County, has said his chamber will 29. The House, which approved the bill with bipartisan support in June, could attempt an override of Stein’s July 2 veto the same day.
Conducted by BW Research for clean energy nonprofits, the new analysis draws on earlier projections from Public Staff, the state-sanctioned customer advocate. That modeling showed that without a near-term climate goal, Duke would build about 40% less new generation capacity over the next decade — leaning harder instead on aging fossil-fueled units to meet demand.
The fresh research calculates the economic losses of foregoing those new power plants, including massive amounts of solar and wind along with 300 megawatts of new nuclear and 1,400 megawatts of combined-cycle gas plants.
From 2030 to 2035, North Carolina would see nearly 50,700 fewer jobs annually and over $47.2 billion sacrificed in power-plant construction, the study says. More than $1.4 billion in tax revenue would also be left on the table.
“This study conveys in real terms the impact of arbitrarily removing a market signal that has proven to be a job creator and an economic booster for North Carolina,” said Josh Brooks, chief of policy strategy and innovation with the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association.
BW Research finds that if SB 266 became law, Duke would have 12 fewer gigawatts of capacity in 2035 to meet peaks in power demand, like those that happen on unusually cold winter mornings. Experts say the company would likely have to purchase more out-of-state power or rely more heavily on fossil fuels as a result.
“This limitation hampers the state’s ability to meet current energy needs and undermines its competitive edge in attracting energy-intensive industries,” the analysts say.
The new study is the second to show how Public Staff’s modeling belie claims from SB 266 proponents that the bill will save money and promote more power generation.
Late last month, three researchers from North Carolina State University found that with fewer solar, wind, and nuclear plants as projected by Public Staff, 40% more natural gas between 2030 and 2050.
Under a worst-case but plausible scenario for gas prices, the trio found, customers could pay $23 billion more in fuel costs on their electric bills by midcentury as a result. The figure would cancel out projected consumer savings from building fewer new sources of generation, a fact not lost on the governor.
“My job is to do everything in my power to lower costs and grow the economy,” Stein said in a statement when he vetoed SB 266 early this month. “This bill fails that test.”
In his veto message, Stein also referenced [make energy more expensive](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/north-carolina-bill-electricity-costs) for North Carolina households.
“[SB 266] shifts the cost of electricity from large industrial users onto the backs of regular people,” Stein said. “Families will pay more so that industry pays less.”
Still, the findings from independent researchers and the three NC State professors may not be enough to counter the lingering narrative that SB 266, dubbed the Power Bill Reduction Act, will help customers.
Duke Energy and major industrial groups have lined up in support of the measure — the latter falsely suggesting that solar power investments have raised electric rates.
The North Carolina Chamber, the state’s major business lobby, says the bill’s enactment would provide “businesses and consumers with more affordable, predictable energy costs.” The group plans to include SB 266 in its annual scorecard rating legislators’ performances.
Perhaps most daunting for clean energy advocates and other bill opponents is that several Democrats appear swayed by these arguments. While Republicans have enough members to overrule Stein in the upper chamber, they’re one vote shy in the House. With all members present, that means the 11 House Democrats who previously voted for SB 266 would need a change of heart to uphold Stein’s veto.
House Speaker Destin Hall, a Republican from Caldwell County, says that won’t happen.
“I’m disappointed in the governor’s veto of the ‘Power Bill Reduction Act,’ which would have delivered cheap, reliable energy to North Carolina, cut the red tape that is choking innovation and long-term energy solutions, and saved consumers over $12 billion dollars,” Hall said in statement moments after Stein rejected the bill. “Considering the strong bipartisan support in both chambers, we anticipate overriding this veto.”
But Will Scott, Southeast climate and clean energy director for the Environmental Defense Fund, hopes the study will help change lawmakers’ minds.
“This shows that passing this legislation is going to have negative consequences for our ability to meet growing demand,” he said, “and that’s going to have knock-on economic impacts across the state.”","Clean energy jobs, Policy regulation, Utilities, Southeast, North Carolina",north-carolina-bill-duke-impact.md,articles_clean-energy-jobs

Thousands of Ohio jobs are at risk as Republicans in Congress decide the fate of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits, according to two new reports.
The 2022 federal climate law spurred announcements of more than $7 billion in clean energy projects in Ohio. An links those investments to nearly 5,000 announced jobs.
A separate research paper published this month by the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions and environmental groups, used broader criteria to conclude that Republicans’ “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” puts more than 17,000 direct manufacturing jobs at risk in the state. The ripple effect on other sectors that work with clean energy companies could bring the number to 
Cleveland, Ohio-based solar company YellowLite is among the firms already pausing hiring in response to federal policy uncertainty. The company said it had planned to bring on 20 to 25 more workers this year to keep up with growing business. Those plans are now on hold.
If the threatened cuts happen, the company fears business will “decline dramatically,” said Al Frasz, YellowLite’s commercial business manager. “We will probably be in a mode of having to lay off 35% to 40% of our employees.”
Frasz is one of dozens of business, labor, civic, and other leaders in Ohio calling upon Congress to revise the current reconciliation budget bill to preserve the IRA tax credits and other clean energy provisions.
Ohio is among the top states to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy incentives. As of last summer, its 9th Congressional District had , which advocates for policies that benefit the economy and the environment. Ohio also ranked among the top 10 states nationwide for announced projects.
“Businesses are reacting to the Senate’s proposal, like the House’s, that would drastically scale back the very tax credits that had been driving an American energy and manufacturing boom,” said Michael Timberlake, ’s communications director, when the group released its data on May 29.
Part of the Inflation Reduction Act’s success in spurring clean energy investments stems from its 10-year time frame for tax credits, noted Joe Flarida, executive director of Power a Clean Future Ohio, which works with local governments on clean energy. That signaled to businesses and communities that there would be some stability, which is important for business planning.
“What we saw was this massive movement and response to use and leverage those tax credits in a productive way,” Flarida said. Pulling the rug out from under organizations that planned or broke ground on projects expecting those tax credits “is going to be a wasteful-government-spending dilemma,” he continued. “What we’re going to see is a ton of investment that’s taken place over the past couple of years completely vanish overnight. And this is just bad policymaking.”
The Ohio Chamber of Commerce would like the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits to continue through 2035, said Tony Long, the organization’s general counsel and director of energy policy. The state needs more energy generation, he added, noting that Ohio imports about a quarter of its electricity from other states.
“These credits will help continue to drive new development of energy sources,” Long said, noting that IRA tax credits have helped small and medium-sized businesses grow.
Private businesses won’t be the only ones impacted if Congress cuts or severely curtails the clean energy credits. “Direct-pay” provisions allow local governments and schools to access incentives after completing qualifying projects. Cities and counties in Ohio are already counting on 30 local government leaders told the state’s congressional delegation this spring.
Consumers also can expect higher electricity prices in the absence of clean energy credits, since less incentive to build new power plants means less energy in the marketplace. Full repeal of the tax credits could cost U.S. households an average of 10% increase in electricity costs, the Clean Energy Buyers Association estimated in February.
Debates continue on the federal reconciliation bill, which Republicans aim to pass in July. Impacts on businesses, workers, and communities will depend on the final provisions.
“This is in the politicians’ hands — if they’re going to continue these credits or they won’t,” said David Green, director of the United Auto Workers’ Region office, which covers Indiana and Ohio. The labor union’s members have benefited from IRA-spurred growth in the automobile industry’s electric vehicle sector. “The reconciliation bill threatens to upend all the positive stuff we have worked towards building good manufacturing jobs, working with companies throughout Ohio and Indiana. … Good union jobs are on the line, and we need to do everything we can to protect the middle class of this country.”","Clean energy jobs, Politics, Midwest, Ohio",ohio-tax-credits-budget-bill.md,articles_clean-energy-jobs

Its collapse is one of many setbacks plaguing the nascent battery recycling sector. 
Li-Cycle's incomplete Rochester, New York, hub. (Li-Cycle)
Li-Cycle once seemed like a leader among the startups trying to recycle electric vehicle batteries in the U.S. Now it’s mired in bankruptcy proceedings.
The company’s board 1, when Li-Cycle publicized that it was Marsal Canada Securities to oversee a sale of Li-Cycle’s assets. A Li-Cycle spokesperson referred Canary Media to the company’s public bankruptcy announcements.
Prospective buyers for the partially completed recycling empire can state their intent by early June. In the meantime, Glencore has “stalking horse” offer of $40 million for most of Li-Cycle’s holdings, setting a floor for bidding (if any other investors want a piece of the action). Glencore could emerge with a real deal on its hands, but it won’t be recouping the 
“The Company represents a compelling investment opportunity, uniquely positioned to benefit from rapid growth in the battery materials and [lithium-ion battery] recycling market, amid increasing global focus on sustainability and critical raw material supply chain resilience,” Alvarez Marsal pitch in a 
That “compelling” opportunity amounts to five battery shredding plants, a massive unfinished recycling center in Western New York, and a business predicated on the growth of a nascent North American EV supply chain that currently faces far-reaching disruption from the Trump administration. A buyer would not be able to fully recycle any batteries without spending a few hundred million dollars more, and even then, it’s not clear they would make any money doing so.
The startup’s collapse underscores the [struggles of the fledgling battery recycling industry](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/recycling-renewables/ev-battery-recycling-had-a-rough-2024) in general. A few years ago, the sector was [flush with venture capital](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/ev-battery-recycling-is-costly-these-five-startups-could-change-that) and charting out rapid timelines for commercializing breakthrough technologies that would enable the transition to EVs [while minimizing mining](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/batteries/an-optimists-guide-to-the-ev-battery-mining-challenge). The sector was also seen as a way to achieve the bipartisan goal of reducing dependence on China, which dominates the global battery supply chain.
Li-Cycle was founded in Canada in 2016 and SPAC (generally a red flag for early-stage cleantech companies). Its engineers developed a technique for shredding whole lithium-ion battery packs while they’re submerged in liquid; this prevented fires and saved considerable effort compared with painstakingly discharging and dismantling the packs for processing.
Li-Cycle successfully built five “spoke” facilities to collect and shred whole electric vehicle battery packs, turning them into the powdery mixture known as black mass. The spoke operations have paused in Arizona, Alabama, New York, and Ontario, while a German outpost continues to function during bankruptcy proceedings. Collectively, these facilities can break down up to 40 kilotons of batteries a year.
The spokes were supposed to feed their black mass to Li-Cycle’s hub in Rochester, New York, which would refine it and isolate useful battery materials to reintroduce into the supply chain. This never came to pass because Li-Cycle halted construction in fall 2023, citing runaway costs. It became clear that Li-Cycle needed to find a lot more cash to complete the nearly 2-million-square-foot site.
The company hoped for a lifeline from the Biden-era Department of Energy: In November, its Loan Programs Office [finalized](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-manufacturing/can-clean-energy-manufacturing-survive-under-trump) a $475 million loan for Li-Cycle to complete the recycling hub. But Li-Cycle 
Li-Cycle is not the only battery recycling firm in a tough spot. Since last year, a number of challenges have beset the industry.

_See more from_ _[Canary Media’s “Chart of the week” column](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/columns/chart-of-the-week)._
The future of steel and ironmaking in the U.S. is poised to get cleaner — so long as the country can let go of the industry’s dirty past.
All new steelmaking and ironmaking capacity in the U.S. is slated to use technologies that sidestep the need to burn coal, according to 
Steel and iron are among the [most essential and widely used materials](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/the-huge-climate-problem-of-cement-steel-and-chemicals-visualized) in the world. They’re also among the dirtiest to produce, responsible together for as much as [9% of global carbon dioxide emissions](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/cleaner-steelmaking-is-actually-starting-to-happen) and a staggering amount of [harmful local air pollution](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/coal-steel-air-pollution-cities).
This is because the sector burns through an enormous amount of coal. The fossil fuel is traditionally used both in blast furnaces to purify iron ore and in basic oxygen furnaces to turn that purified iron into primary steel.
In the U.S., 12 blast furnaces are still producing iron ore this way, but the country’s steelmakers have largely shifted away from making primary steel. Instead, they increasingly rely on electric arc furnaces, a much cleaner technology that uses electricity to melt iron and scrap steel and turn it into fresh steel.
About 70% of the country’s steelmaking capacity today uses electric arc furnaces. All of the new capacity planned in the U.S. will come in the form of facilities that use electric arc furnaces, per Global Energy Monitor’s report.
In theory, steelmakers can run this electric equipment on clean power and pair it with a coal-free iron production process called direct reduction to create carbon-free primary steel. All of the new ironmaking capacity planned in the U.S. will use direct reduction, the report says, likely including [Hyundai’s $6 billion plan](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/hyundai-low-carbon-steel-louisiana?token=nFV32m9ZvqUkzuBB7qeAqyCOItacpLAX&x-craft-preview=615d269fd33993411c10c4712dd1cf338571bdde524f52c0f558a45c325678b2uepynllemm) to make what it describes as “low-carbon” steel in Louisiana. The country will more than double its capacity for direct reduction of iron in the coming years, the report found.
For now, U.S. facilities that use direct reduction will mainly rely on natural gas to purify the ore. Doing so can halve carbon emissions compared with using a coal-based blast furnace. The [holy grail from a decarbonization standpoint](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/the-trillion-dollar-quest-to-make-green-steel) is to eventually use carbon-free hydrogen in place of gas in the reduction process.
However, despite plans for cleaner facilities, steelmakers don’t intend to retire their dirtiest assets. Several of the dozen coal-fired blast furnaces still operating are slated to undergo costly relinings before 2030 — effectively committing to operating for many more years. A retirement plan has been announced for only one.","Green steel, Clean industry",us-iron-furnace-cleaner.md,articles_green-steel
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/boston-metal-decarbonization-technology,Boston Metal forges path to commercialization for green steel process,5 June 2025,Sarah Shemkus,"Amid industry setbacks and federal funding losses, the company, which makes green steel without burning fossil fuels, has a robust plan for moving ahead. 
Massachusetts-based Boston Metal is on the verge of earning its first revenue as it continues honing a novel steelmaking process so clean it can vent emissions into a parking lot the company shares with a day care center. 
“It just proves how different the future of steel can be,” said the firm’s senior vice president for business development, Adam Rauwerdink.
The technique, which was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is now being scaled up for commercialization, uses electricity to remove contaminants from iron ore, producing a small fraction of the emissions generated by traditional fossil fuel–fired blast furnaces. Indeed, the technology releases no carbon dioxide — just oxygen — and the only greenhouse gas emissions are those associated with the electricity used to power the system.
Promoting green steel was a major element of former President Joe Biden’s economic and environmental agenda. However, the Trump administration’s desire to boost fossil fuels has already undermined these efforts and left the future of the sector in question.
Against that backdrop, Boston Metal, with its carefully calibrated business plan and lack of dependence on increasingly unreliable federal funding, seems to have unusually bright prospects.
The company was founded in 2013 to take on the challenge of reducing the tremendous amounts of greenhouse gases released by the steel industry, a sector responsible for 400 million in investments from a [range of backers](http://canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/boston-metal-gets-big-funding-boost-to-make-green-steel) including global steel giant ArcelorMittal, the venture-capital arm of oil company Saudi Aramco, global investment manager MG Investments, the World Bank’s International Finance Corp., and major climatetech funds such as Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund.
The possible payoff is significant: Demand for low-emissions steel is expected to increase by at least 6.7 million tons by 2030, though production of green steel is still very limited globally, said Kaitlyn Ramirez, senior associate with energy transition think tank RMI.“The demand for green steel is there,” Ramirez said. “We’re seeing the momentum … even when there are challenges on the supply side that need to be resolved.”
## **A novel way to refine iron ore**
The task of greening steel production is daunting. Globally, nearly 1.9 billion metric tons of steel are produced each year, and on average, each ton of steel is responsible for 2 tons of carbon dioxide emissions.
Roughly 90% of the emissions associated with steelmaking are generated by refining iron to use as a base material, Rauwerdink said. And that step has historically depended on burning a fuel — usually coal — to create the high temperatures at which iron ore can be melted and impurities removed. Seven such coal-fired plants remain in operation in the United States, [contributing to high pollution levels](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/coal-steel-air-pollution-cities) in the cities where they are located.
Another process, known as direct reduction of iron, or DRI, burns natural gas to remove contaminants from iron ore. DRI systems can also be configured to burn hydrogen, though the current supply of green hydrogen — hydrogen created using renewable energy — is too scant and too expensive to be a reliable source of low-emissions fuel right now, Ramirez said. Still, she noted that hydrogen-fueled DRI is currently the most promising emerging alternative to traditional, emissions-intensive steel production.
“They can start using more hydrogen as it becomes available,” she said.
Boston Metal sidesteps that complication by refining iron through a process called molten oxide electrolysis. Iron ore is poured into a brick-lined chamber, where it dissolves in an electrolyte solution. An electric current runs through the liquid, melting the ore. Contaminants in the ore — like alumina, silica, and calcia — are left behind in the solution, while the molten purified metal settles to the bottom of the chamber.
When enough iron has accumulated, the chamber is tapped, in a sort of fiery, industrial analog to tapping a maple tree for sap. A meter-long bit drills into the cell, allowing the molten iron to flow out. Then the hole is plugged with a ceramic clay until the next tapping.
Though the equipment runs constantly at a temperature of about 1,600 degrees Celsius, the air just a few feet away remains cool. The entire production floor is light and clean, and the only noise is a low buzz from the machines — a far cry from the traditional sweltering, clamorous steel mills.
The electricity powering the process runs from an anode at the top of the chamber to the molten metal, which acts as a cathode. The anode is one of Boston Metal’s major technological innovations. For the equipment to produce significant quantities of molten iron, the anode must be made of a material that can resist corrosion in the oxygen-rich environment. MIT researchers developed an alloy that can do just that.
The anode “can run for a month and it comes out the same shape and size,” Rauwerdink said, noting that the company relies on laser imaging to precisely find and measure even the most miniscule changes.
The first trial runs in the MIT lab used an anode about the size of a marble and produced a roughly 1-gram nugget of purified iron. At Boston Metal’s 38,000-square-foot facility in a Boston suburb, five of these small-scale systems are still in operation, allowing technicians, over the course of several hours, to see how variations in the electrical current or the electrolyte composition affect the process.
Several midsize systems also run in the facility as does one full-scale cell that can produce roughly a ton of purified iron per month using 10 anodes, each roughly the size and shape of half a basketball. When expanded to production scale, each cell can be fitted with more anodes, and each operation can have multiple cells running. Rauwerdink estimates that commercial producers will be able to put out multiple tons every day.
## Commercializing molten oxide electrolysis
As Boston Metal continues to refine its system, it is also trying to work its way toward profitability. To get there, company leaders have decided on a strategy that, perhaps unexpectedly, puts steel on the back burner for the moment.
The key is niobium, a metal that is valuable as an alloying element in steel production and that can be extracted from other materials using molten oxide electrolysis. Niobium sells for about $82 per kilogram (about $74,000 per ton) right now, according to the Shanghai Metals Market, while steel goes for roughly $900 per ton. Boston Metal plans to focus on extracting and selling the metal for now, to start bringing in money while continuing to finesse its method for producing green steel.
In 2023, the company began building a facility in Brazil to extract niobium from mining waste and industrial slag. The first cell in the operation should come online this month, and revenue is expected to start flowing later this year. 
“That’s a big milestone for us,” Rauwerdink said. 
This graduated approach gives the company some stability at a time when the future of green steel in the U.S. is anything but certain.
Last year, the Biden administration awarded [$500 million each](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/us-pledges-up-to-1b-for-two-pioneering-green-steel-projects) to two projects aiming to make low-emissions steel using hydrogen for DRI. However, one recipient, Cleveland-Cliffs, has “more economical fossil fuels” and also prolonging the life of an existing coal-burning blast furnace. Further, as Japan’s Nippon Steel looks to acquire U.S. Steel, Trump has touted the possibility of keeping the operation’s coal-burning blast furnaces up and running for another 10 years. The Trump administration has also halted or rolled back much of the funding Biden had dedicated to green steel development.
Boston Metal, however, is somewhat insulated from these headwinds. While Trump’s funding moves have created economic uncertainty, the company is not directly supported by any federal grants, though it has received some federal support in the past. The company is waiting to hear the fate of a $50 million grant related to chromium production, but the outcome will have no effect on its plans to commercialize the molten oxide electrification process. And because the system doesn’t use any fossil fuels, the political battles over coal and natural gas have little relevance.
Boston Metal plans to build a demonstration plant for steel production by 2028 — it’s still looking for the right site — then take the system to market. The company intends to license the technology to steel-making operations, rather than owning and operating facilities itself, and is already exploring opportunities in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, Rauwerdink said.
Producers using Boston Metal’s technology are likely to seek out locations with a clean, low-priced electric supply to maximize the economic and environmental advantages, he said.
Boston Metal’s technology and that of other companies exploring the use of electricity hold a lot of promise, but plenty of questions and hurdles remain, Ramirez said. 
“They’re very exciting, and they definitely have a role to play,” she said. “The questions are timeline and scale.

The story also originally misstated the material from which Boston Metal will extract niobium.

Big steel and mining players are funding this startup’s all-electric tech to see if it can scale. 
Workers at Electra’s pilot electrowinning facility in Boulder, Colorado, inspect a sheet of electroplated purified iron. (Electra)
Electrowinning is a time-tested method for removing impurities from metals, and it’s able to run on clean electricity and at the same temperature as a fresh cup of coffee. Could it help clean up heavy industry by replacing the gigantic coal-fired blast furnaces used to purify iron, a key ingredient in steelmaking?
Sandeep Nijhawan, CEO and cofounder of [electrolytic clean-iron technology](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/electrowinning-could-help-win-the-race-to-clean-up-dirty-steel) startup 186 million from investors, including some major players in the [trillion-dollar global iron and steel industry,](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/the-trillion-dollar-quest-to-make-green-steel) to further test its proposition.
Thursday’s round was led by Capricorn Investment Group and Temasek Holdings, and included previous investors Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, and Investments. It also included Rio Tinto, Roy Hill, and BHP’s venture capital arm, representing some of the world’s largest iron ore suppliers; leading steelmakers Nucor and Yamato Kogyo; and major iron and steel buyers organizations Interfer Edelstahl Group and Toyota Tsusho Corp., the trading arm of Toyota Group and supplier to Toyota Motor Corp.
“This broad, very sophisticated, strategic investor base gives us a vote of confidence that our solution can potentially be an integral part of the value chain,” Nijhawan said.
The new funding will finance Electra’s first demonstration-scale project, which aims to produce about 500 tonnes of high-purity iron annually when it opens next year — a droplet in the 2023. The company hopes to have a commercial-scale production site, of undisclosed size and capacity, operational in 2029, Nijhawan said.
1,600 degrees Celsius.
Cutting that carbon footprint requires [shifting to electric arc furnaces](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/chart-steelmaking-is-starting-to-go-electric) that use electricity to melt a mix of steel scrap and purified iron into new steel. But to clean up the industry, the purified iron going into those furnaces must first be produced in ways that don’t choke the atmosphere.
“We are replacing how iron has been made for centuries,” Nijhawan said. “When you think about that transition, you think about a long-term view of how you create a stable business in that environment.”
Electra’s process is competing against a number of alternative methods for making lower-carbon iron. The most prevalent approach to date — and the one that’s gotten[ billions of dollars of investment](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/worlds-first-major-green-steel-project-locks-down-5b-in-funding) — is [direct reduction of iron via hydrogen](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/big-steel-starts-prepping-for-a-net-zero-world).
Direct reduced iron is being deployed by the biggest green-steel projects in the world, such as the [ Green Steel](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/the-worlds-largest-low-carbon-steel-plant-moves-closer-to-completion) and [Hybrit](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/green-steel-is-coming-sooner-than-you-think) plants in Sweden.

The process also requires [cost-effective production of carbon-free hydrogen](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/how-can-the-us-get-clean-hydrogen-to-industries-that-need-it-the-most), a challenging prospect in and of itself.

Electra’s quest to purify iron via electrowinning has faced some key challenges. For example, the company had to figure out how to accelerate the dissolution of iron ore in the solution and how to maintain the purity of the ions collected through the electrowinning process, Quoc Pham, the company’s cofounder and chief technology officer, told Canary Media in 2023. A handful of 
Electra has produced plates of pure iron in pilot tests. That’s just the first of many steps in proving it can cost-effectively scale up the technology to operate in high-throughput industrial settings using iron ores with a wide mix of chemical compositions, Nijhawan said.
But success on those fronts could unlock a lot of opportunities for Electra investors along the iron and steel value chain, he said — starting with the company’s longest-running strategic investor and top U.S. steelmaker Nucor.
Nucor exclusively uses electric arc furnaces, which require careful calibration of the mix of scrap steel and purified iron going into them to produce different grades of steel for diverse industrial sectors.
Those include the automotive manufacturing market, where [multi-billion-dollar investments](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/hyundai-low-carbon-steel-louisiana) in the electric equipment.
“We’re seeing a shift in the automotive sector,” Noah Hanners, Nucor’s executive vice president for sheet products, said in a Thursday statement. “As we produce more [electric arc furnace] steel for the automotive market, our demand for sustainable feedstocks like Electra’s product will only continue to grow.”
Electra’s technology can also purify a wide range of iron ores, which could open up new markets for iron-mining giants like those investing in the startup’s latest round, Nijhawan noted. That’s particularly valuable for low-carbon steelmaking since hydrogen direct reduced iron can handle only a narrow range of impurities, which could limit its use to the 
Nijhawan highlighted another distinguishing feature of Electra’s approach — its modularity. A typical steel plant that uses a blast furnace or the direct reduced iron process costs billions of dollars, takes years to build, and involves coordinating the delivery of massive amounts of iron and fuel.
Electra’s electrolytic modules, by contrast, can be deployed at a variety of scales to match supply and demand dynamics in different markets. “One electrical array can go up to 50,000 tons, for example, and you can do that again and again,” he said. “It’s not like you have to go build a 2-million-ton plant to become economically viable.”
That optionality could ease concerns from investors wary of sinking billions of dollars into a single facility using a novel technology, he said. It also allows Electra to test its modules and improve performance and cost in succeeding generations.
Similar dynamics have helped propel solar panels and lithium-ion batteries to the cheapest and most easily deployable energy technology today, he noted. “It helps you to have the same repeat unit that you’re perfecting for quality, for defects — and to learn fast as a result.”","Green steel, Clean industry, Climatetech finance",electra-clean-iron-investment-electrowinning.md,articles_green-steel

While China leads the world in both the production and adoption of clean energy tech like solar and EVs, the country has been slower to tackle decarbonizing heavy industry. That is starting to change.
In July, the Chinese state-owned steelmaker HBIS Group agreed to sell more than 10,000 metric tons of green steel to a buyer in Italy. The agreement set a deadline for delivery by the end of August. That same week, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited China and 
Meanwhile, in the U.S., steel producers are backing away from earlier commitments to produce green steel. Just before President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, the Swedish steelmaker SSAB [pulled out of negotiations](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/ssab-quietly-pulls-out-of-500m-green-steel-award-negotiations) for $500 million in federal funding to back a project to make iron with green hydrogen. In June, Cleveland-Cliffs [abandoned its own green steel effort](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/cleveland-cliffs-middletown-trump) in Middletown, Ohio, after the Trump administration pressed the steelmaker to use a $500 million Biden-era grant to ramp up coal-fired iron production. Nippon Steel pledged to modernize U.S. Steel after securing Trump’s support for a $15 billion acquisition of its American rival in June, but the Japanese giant’s [reputation](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/direct-reduced-iron-tenova-midrex) as a “coal company that also makes steel” suggests the merger could extend the life of blast furnaces in Indiana and Pennsylvania.
“A lot of the rhetoric around competitiveness with China makes it seem like we think we must not fall behind. Stories like this make clear we already are behind,” said Marcela Mulholland, a former official at the Department of Energy’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations who now leads advocacy at the nonpartisan climate group Clean Tomorrow. “It is happening. The green steel example is just one of many.”
## **What kind of green steel is China making – and how much?**
China produces a staggering amount of steel each year — more than 1 billion metric tons. About 90% is made with a two-stop process that relies on coal. First, iron is smelted from ore in a coal-fired blast furnace. Then the iron is transformed into steel in a basic oxygen furnace. About 10% of the country’s steel is made with an electric arc furnace, a process that – if powered by green electricity – is much cleaner, but depends on a steady supply of scrap metal as a feedstock. (The U.S. has a decided advantage with this particular technology since most of the steel that the nation produces uses scrap metal in EAFs.)
China has yet to widely implement the technology known as direct reduction of iron, or DRI, which typically relies on natural gas to produce iron but which can also use hydrogen. The country’s supplies of the former fuel are limited, spurring it to experiment with ways to conduct DRI using the latter.
China has many small-scale pilot projects manufacturing steel with hydrogen, but most involve minimal volumes of the material. For example, the country’s No. 2 steelmaker, Angang Steel Co., is producing DRI per year. HBIS is shipping that volume of steel to Italy this month alone. Only HBIS and another major producer, China Baowu Steel Group, are producing green steel with hydrogen in significant quantities, according to 
How clean the hydrogen is that China uses to make steel is a complicated question. Hydrogen – the smallest molecule – is already widely used in industrial processes and offers a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels since it produces no carbon dioxide when burned. Yet the vast majority of the global supply of hydrogen is made through methods that use fossil fuels and generate planet-heating emissions. When made with electrolyzers powered by renewable energy, hydrogen produces almost no emissions at all, but production of this form – green hydrogen – is nascent and comes at a high premium. (DRI using green hydrogen paired with EAFs is the highest – but nearly nonexistent – standard for producing green steel.)
Headquartered in Hebei province, HBIS started experimenting with lower-carbon steel in part by using hydrogen captured from its coking plants, where coal is roasted at more than 1,110 degrees Fahrenheit to cook off contaminants and produce an industrial-grade fuel. Roughly 60% of the gas emitted during the process is hydrogen.
It’s unclear how much of the steel HBIS is shipping to Italy is made with iron that employs hydrogen produced from industrial waste processes rather than the green stuff made from electricity generated by nearby renewables. HBIS did not respond to a request for comment.
But David Fishman, a principal at the Shanghai-based energy consultancy The Lantau Group, said “there are quite a few” sources of hydrogen made with renewable power near HBIS’s facility in northern China. He noted that HBIS has a strategic partnership with the China National Petroleum Corp., which launched its 2023.
The export deal may be a sign of China raising its ambitions for cleaner steel. The national government had set a target for 15% of steel coming from EAFs by the end of this year. But that steelmaking capacity has remained at 10% for more than a decade.
Part of the problem is that provincial steel targets are at odds with the policies set in Beijing. Though the national government opened China to imported scrap steel that could be used in EAFs, imports halved in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air analysis. Ten provinces, meanwhile, ramped up production of coal-made steel in the first half of this year, bringing down prices and disincentivizing more costly green investments, said Xinyi Shen, the China team lead for the Finnish nonprofit, who authored the report.
But if China can deepen its stockpiles of scrap steel, the country could more quickly build out a lower-carbon steel industry using EAFs while it waits to improve technology on green hydrogen that can bring down costs of fully decarbonized steel, Shen said.
“This is a more promising way to produce low-carbon steel,” she said. “For hydrogen steelmaking, it depends on the progress of green power.” 
The bottleneck, she said, is “always the feedstock for DRI.”
But two recent policy changes on renewable power could incentivize Chinese companies to use more of the nation’s vast solar and wind resources to generate green hydrogen.
The first, called the 430 policy, took effect on May 1 and requires that new distributed solar arrays — like those on buildings’ rooftops — first power the facility they are sited on before selling any surplus electricity onto the grid. The second, dubbed the 531 policy, eliminates the guaranteed “feed-in tariffs” that renewables projects long benefited from in China, and requires new solar and wind farms to sell electricity on the spot market.
Whether policies that direct renewable power away from the grid benefit hydrogen producers by making that power more available to them depends on the provincial-level strategies for the fuel, which vary, Shen said. But the emergence of overseas buyers willing to pay more for steel made with green hydrogen could drive the market, she said.
## **A ‘significant’ attempt to ‘seize commercial opportunities’ in Europe’s steel market**
Starting next year, the European Union, of which Italy is a founding member, is set to fully implement its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. The carbon tariff essentially levies an extra cost on imports made with more planet-heating pollution. That means China’s coal-fired steel is about to become less competitive. While China could ramp up scrap-based EAF steel, Shen said the quality of that product tends to be very low, making it unappealing for export. The Italy deal, according to the Boston Consulting Group, shows the levies are creating a market for truly green material.
“This development holds significant implications,” Nicole Voigt, the Boston Consulting Group’s global lead of metals, told Canary Media. “China’s commitment clearly highlights its intent to seize commercial opportunities in the green steel market, especially in Europe.”
It’ll take time for the cost to come down. But China “overall has a long-term direction for carbon neutrality,” Shen said. “This gives companies and investors confidence and certainty to invest into newer technologies.”
Under the previous administration, the U.S. pumped [billions of dollars into green hydrogen](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/biden-admin-picks-7-clean-hydrogen-hubs-for-7-billion-federal-boost) and [clean industrial projects](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/biden-admin-invests-6b-to-cut-carbon-from-steel-cement-and-snacks), and made [tax credits for renewables](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/tax-credit-changes-trump-law) available into the 2030s. Even then, America hardly employed all the policy mechanisms at play in China. The federal clean-industry program where Mulholland worked supported a few dozen projects, almost all of which saw their funding [yanked away by the Trump administration](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/oced-demonstrations-grants-cuts-trump) this spring. Last year alone, China had nearly twice the number of low-carbon industrial demonstration projects. This year, Beijing funded a second set of more than 100 new projects.
“The investment into these new technologies will need a long, stable policy environment,” Shen said. “Long-term, the political goal is there here in China.”

It was supposed to be the United States’ grand entry to the [global race to make green steel](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/the-trillion-dollar-quest-to-make-green-steel) — a symbol of a return to American innovation and of revival in the nation’s rusting industrial heartland.
Instead, Cleveland-Cliffs’ [plan to replace coal-based blast furnaces](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/us-pledges-up-to-1b-for-two-pioneering-green-steel-projects) with cleaner, hydrogen-ready technology at its Middletown Works facility in Ohio — the same mill that Vice President JD Vance described as his grandparents’ “economic savior” in his “Hillbilly Elegy” memoir — now risks being swept away in the undercurrent of Washington’s shifting partisan tides.
Neither the Cleveland-based steelmaker nor the Department of Energy, which put up $500 million to back the project, has formally pulled the plug on the plan to build a direct reduced iron plant capable of using hydrogen and two electric melting furnaces. But updates from the company in recent weeks suggest the ambitious carbon-free version of the project is all but dead.
On a first-quarter CEO Lourenco Goncalves said the company was negotiating with the Department of Energy to “explore changes to the scope to better align with the administration’s energy priorities.”
Rather than use hydrogen, the green version of which remains expensive and in limited supply, Goncalves said the project would “instead rely on readily available and more economical fossil fuels.” At an event earlier this month hosted by the lobbying group American Iron and Steel Institute, Goncalves said the lack of a hydrogen-generating hub nearby made it impossible to source the fuel on the project’s timeline.
“Without hydrogen, the entire thing falls apart,” Goncalves said, according to “At the very least, I will not have hydrogen at the time I need for that specific project.”
Cleveland-Cliffs did not reply to Canary Media’s emailed questions on Friday, nor did the Energy Department return a request for comment on the status of the federal funding.
But Goncalves could announce the fate of the project as soon as Tuesday, when he’s 
“Before all this uncertainty, this project was going to be, potentially, the first green-steel plant in the U.S.,” said Hilary Lewis, the steel director at the climate research group Industrious Labs. “With all this uncertainty, and particularly with this potential pivot toward fossil fuels, the future of clean iron and steelmaking in the U.S. is much less clear, and that puts our competitiveness at risk.”
The up-front costs of installing entirely new equipment always outweighed those of simply renovating the existing coal-fired unit.
400 million, according to RMI estimates. The total cost of building the DRI plant and electric melting furnaces came out to $1.6 billion, meaning Cleveland-Cliffs was on the hook for $1.1 billion even with the federal grant the Biden administration finalized last September.
The traditional coal-based method of making steel — which involves melting iron ore in a blast furnace then refining the iron into steel in a basic oxygen furnace — 390 per metric ton, according to an October report from Columbia University’s Business School. Scrap melted down in an electric arc furnace came out to $415 per metric ton. Steel made with iron from DRI fueled with natural gas and then refined in an electric arc furnace averaged out to $455 per metric ton.
Producing the iron through DRI with entirely green hydrogen, instead of gas, spiked the price to around $800 per metric ton.
The cost of making hydrogen with electrolyzers powered by certifiably clean electricity is among the biggest challenges to green steel in the U.S. That hurdle is now poised to become even higher as congressional Republicans seek to repeal the [Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credit,](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/bidens-clean-hydrogen-tax-credits-are-officially-decided-for-now) which aimed to make green hydrogen cost-competitive with the gas-derived version of the fuel. The Senate Finance Committee on Monday 
That isn’t an issue for Europe’s leading green steel project. Formerly known as Green Steel, the newly renamed Stegra plant benefits from the vast amount of carbon-free energy in Sweden, where the overwhelming 
In the U.S., by contrast, green hydrogen plants hinged on massive projects to construct wind turbines and solar panels that needed to be 70% larger in capacity to make up for the intermittency of the renewables, according to Elizabeth Boatman, a lead consultant at the Michigan-based clean energy consultancy 5 Lakes Energy. A dedicated nuclear reactor to generate the power for electrolysis could do so more efficiently, she said, noting that the availability of underground salt caverns to store hydrogen for later use could also further bring down the cost of projects.
“I don’t think anyone on any side of this thought hydrogen at scale wouldn’t be a barrier,” Boatman said. “The amount of new renewables the company would have to build out, along with transmission infrastructure, was clearly going to be expensive.”
In 2021, the Biden administration set a target of 1 per kilogram. The company did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Canary Media on whether that figure banked on the tax credit.)
If the U.S. managed to achieve a supply at that price, steel made with green hydrogen-powered DRI and an electric arc furnace DRI and an electric arc furnace, at $550 per ton, or blast furnace steel at $565 per ton. If the U.S. were to institute even a modest carbon price, it could reach cost parity with coal-fired steel.
But if the tax credit disappears, those numbers will be near-impossible to achieve.
Regardless of cost challenges, Boatman said, “it’s still an attractive solution, not just because of the potential to curb climate-warming emissions but also criteria air pollutants and other hazardous air pollution tied to the production process from a blast furnace with coal.”
The original, low-carbon version of the Cleveland-Cliffs project also has significant potential economic benefits.
The plant overhaul would have spurred $373 million in economic activity around the facility and brought 2,300 jobs to Middletown, according to analysis shared with Canary Media by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a think tank. It’s not clear how a relining project would stack up.
That’s what made the project so significant, not just as a potential climate solution but as a way to revitalize a town in the heart of America’s steelmaking region, said Brad Townsend, the Ohio-based vice president of policy and outreach at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.
“Middletown is sort of the quintessential Midwest steel- and paper-making town that is looking for a way to leverage that history and infrastructure and know-how to chart a path forward,” he said. “This project would have done exactly that.”

Nippon Steel, the parent company of U.S. Steel, is moving forward with its plans to renovate a giant coal-fueled furnace in Gary, Indiana.
The Japan-based steel manufacturer, which acquired U.S. Steel in June, will begin “relining” its largest blast furnace at the Gary Works steel mill in 2026, U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt said this week at an industry conference in Atlanta, details 
Such an investment can extend a furnace’s operating life by up to 20 years — prolonging the company’s reliance on coal-based steelmaking, and potentially delaying [America’s broader transition](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/the-trillion-dollar-quest-to-make-green-steel) to low-carbon manufacturing methods.
Nippon Steel has committed to spending around 14, the largest of four blast furnaces still operating at the sprawling Gary Works complex on Lake Michigan. The Japanese steelmaker said it will spend a total of 11 billion capital investment in U.S. Steel’s footprints through 2028.
“Gary Works supports a large number of jobs and demand in the Midwest, and we are moving forward with numerous investment plans to support the industry,” Burritt said at the conference, adding that U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel expect to announce more specific details about their plans soon. (A spokesperson for U.S. Steel confirmed Burritt’s remarks in an email.)
Blast furnaces make the iron that’s turned into high-strength steel, an essential material found in everything from cars, boats, and planes to buildings, bridges, and roads.
The scorching-hot furnaces combine iron ore with purified coal, or “coke,” and limestone to produce liquid iron, which is then moved into a separate furnace to become steel. Only 75% of the industry’s greenhouse gas emissions. They’re also among the [biggest sources of toxic air pollution](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/steel-coke-plant-pollution-trump-delay-rules) in the communities where they operate.
America’s blast furnaces — among the oldest in the world — use specialized bricks that degrade over time. When that happens, companies can decide to undertake a costly and lengthy maintenance process to replace the bricks and prop up aging plants. Or they can put that money toward building cleaner facilities that make use of “direct reduced iron” technology that doesn’t require coal.
Climate advocates and community groups in Gary, Indiana, are urging Nippon Steel to take the second route.
“Today, the company is at a crossroads,” Toko Tomita, campaigns director at the advocacy group SteelWatch, said in a statement. “If this relining decision goes ahead, it would be a slap in the face for communities, and a coffin-nail for Nippon Steel’s reputation on climate.”
Tomita said that relining the Gary Works furnace is “an extremely short-sighted move” that will leave Nippon Steel with outdated facilities at a time when automakers and other major steel buyers are increasingly [signaling their demand](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/big-steel-buyers-make-a-request-for-1m-tons-of-green-steel) for products made using lower-emission methods.At the moment, however, America’s steelmakers seem committed to keeping their coal-based mills up and running.
Along with its four Gary Works blast furnaces, U.S. Steel operates two blast furnaces at its Edgar Thomson plant in the Mon Valley Works in southwestern Pennsylvania — the same complex that [suffered a deadly explosion](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/clairton-coke-works-explosion) on Aug. 11 at a coke-producing plant.

## **Making cleaner steel with clean power**
Steel is an essential material used to make everything from railroads, bridges, and buildings to solar-panel racks, electric vehicles, and grid components. Producing the high-strength metal is currently an [extremely dirty business](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/the-trillion-dollar-quest-to-make-green-steel), responsible for as much as 9% of global carbon dioxide emissions and a significant amount of harmful local air pollution.
That’s because most steel production globally involves burning copious amounts of coal in a blast furnace to turn raw iron ore into iron; the iron is then made into steel in a separate furnace. The United States still operates a dozen blast furnaces, which account for roughly 30% of the country’s annual steel production.
The remaining 70% of U.S. steel output comes from electric arc furnaces, including the hulking unit at Rocky Mountain Steel’s facility, which is capable of producing 
Producing steel this way can curb CO emissions by up to 75% compared to traditional coal-based methods, according to 100-plus such facilities operating in the U.S. rely primarily on coal- and gas-fired electric grids.
Until a few years ago, Rocky Mountain Steel got its power from Xcel Energy’s coal-fired power plant in Pueblo.
Lightsource bp financed, owns, and operates the neighboring $285 million Bighorn Solar project. The developer sells the electricity it generates to Xcel under a 20-year power purchase agreement; the utility then provides power to Evraz North America for the steel mill. When the 1,800-acre solar array came online in late 2021, Bighorn became the nation’s largest on-site solar facility dedicated to a single customer.
“This project proves that even hard-to-abate sectors like steel can be decarbonized when companies come together with innovative solutions,” Kevin Smith, who was then the CEO of Lightsource bp, Americas, said in an October 2021 “the low, predictable electricity prices it needs to stay in Pueblo and invest in its future there, keeping more than 1,000 jobs in the local community,” according to the release.

Atlas Holdings, the firm acquiring Evraz North America, didn’t immediately return questions this week about whether the sale would affect the solar-power agreement in Pueblo. However, Atlas noted in its June 27 news release that the “Pueblo steel mill stands as a remarkable testament to commitment to sustainability” owing to the solar project.","Green steel, Clean industry, Solar, West, Colorado",new-owner-colorado-solar-mill.md,articles_green-steel
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/cliffs-cleveland-works-blast-furnace-relining-climate-goals,A coal-burning steel plant may thwart Cleveland’s climate goals,18 September 2025,Kathiann M. Kowalski,"The facility is the city’s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Advocates say its dirty blast furnaces need to be replaced with cleaner technology. 
Cleveland Works currently relies on two blast furnaces, which use coal to refine iron ore that is later processed into steel. (The Center For Land Use Interpretation; 
Cleveland has big ambitions to reduce its planet-warming emissions. But a massive steelmaking facility run by Cleveland-Cliffs, one of Ohio’s major employers, could make it difficult for the city to see those plans through.
The plant emits roughly 4.2 million metric tons of greenhouse gases each year, complicating Cleveland’s effort to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, according to a 
Cleveland’s “bold and achievable,” said Hilary Lewis, steel director for Industrious Labs. But “if they want to achieve those goals, they have to take action on this Cleveland Works facility.”
As a major investment decision looms over an aging blast furnace at the facility, it’s unclear whether the company will move to cut its direct greenhouse gas emissions — or opt to reinvest in its existing coal-dependent processes.
Cliffs’ progress in reducing its nationwide emissions earned it recognition as a [2023 Goal Achiever](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/how-an-ohio-based-steel-company-cut-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-nearly-a-third) in the Department of Energy’s Better Climate Challenge. As this year began, the company was set to slash emissions even further through projects supported by Biden-era legislation — the Inflation Reduction Act and the 2021 infrastructure law.
Then the Trump administration commenced its monthslong campaign of reneging on funding commitments for clean energy projects, including ones meant to ramp up the production of “green” hydrogen made with renewable energy. In June, Cliffs’ CEO Lourenco Goncalves backed away from a federally funded project to convert its [Middletown Works](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/cleveland-cliffs-middletown-trump) in southwestern Ohio to produce green steel, saying there wouldn’t be a sufficient supply of hydrogen for the plant.
To Lewis, coauthor of the Industrious Labs report, that’s a weak excuse, because hydrogen production by other companies would have ramped up to supply the facility. “[Cliffs was] going to need so much hydrogen that they would be creating the demand,” she said.
Meanwhile, Cliffs’ Cleveland Works continues to spew emissions that drive climate change and harm human health. Industrious Labs’ modeling estimates that pollution from Cleveland Works is responsible for up to 39 early deaths per year, more than 1,700 lost work days, and more than 9,000 asthma cases. Cleveland ranks as the country’s 
## **A road map for cutting carbon**
Cleveland Works’ Blast Furnace #6 is a hulking vessel that removes impurities from iron ore by combining it with limestone and coke, a form of coal that burns at very high temperatures. Industrious Labs’ report notes the unit’s lining is nearing the end of its useful life. 
To Industrious Labs, this presents an opportunity: The company could replace the old infrastructure with equipment that can process iron ore with natural gas or hydrogen instead of coal. Investing in this technology, called direct reduction, would cut the plant’s greenhouse gas emissions by more than 30% if natural gas is used. Using green hydrogen would slash emissions even more, the Industrious Labs team found.
The alternative is to just reline the furnace, which was the course Cliffs chose for the Cleveland facility’s Blast Furnace #5 in 2022.
Relining might provide small emissions cuts when measured per ton of steel, due to increased efficiencies, Lewis said. But ramped-up production from running more ore through the furnace could offset those reductions or even increase total emissions.
Cliffs did not respond to Canary Media’s repeated requests for comment for this story, and it has not yet publicly announced its plans for Blast Furnace #6.
To put itself on track with Cleveland’s emissions goals, however, the company would need to do more than just convert Blast Furnace #6 to the direct reduction process, Industrious Labs said.
The next step in the road map the group laid out would be for Cliffs to process refined iron ore into steel with an electric arc furnace — which can run on carbon-free power — instead of using the current basic oxygen equipment. Investing in green-hydrogen-based direct reduction and an electric arc furnace, instead of relining Blast Furnace #6, would increase emissions cuts to 47%, according to the Industrious Labs report.
Later steps would use direct reduction of iron and an electric arc furnace to refine and process the ore that is currently handled by Blast Furnace #5. Completing that work would cut Cleveland Works’ greenhouse gas emissions by 96%, according to the report.
## **What happens now?**
The Industrious Labs analysis appears to lay out a credible decarbonization pathway, although not necessarily the only one, said Jenita McGowan, Cuyahoga County’s deputy chief of sustainability and climate. Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, also has a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and is in the process of finalizing the latest version of its 
“My question about the paper is how feasible it truly is that Cleveland-Cliffs will deploy it in the near future,” McGowan said. Policy uncertainties at the federal level further complicate matters, she added.
For now, the city and county seem to be taking a pragmatic approach, focusing on achievements to date and encouraging future cuts wherever companies will make them.
But getting to net-zero for the industrial sector “will require more fundamental changes … [which] will take place over decades, rather than over a few years,” Cleveland’s climate action plan says. It also notes that low-carbon steel costs 40% more to produce compared to standard methods, “making it difficult for steelmakers to justify the investment in clean production.”
Cuyahoga County’s draft climate plan highlights Cliffs’ energy-efficiency improvements, including Cleveland Works’ use of some iron from the firm’s direct reduction plant in Toledo, Ohio. Cleveland Works also leverages much of the waste heat from its industrial activities to make electricity. The facility recently boosted that combined-heat-and-power generation by about 50 megawatts, the plan notes. That replaces electricity the plant would otherwise need from the grid, a majority of which still comes from fossil fuels.
Faster emissions reductions are certainly better, McGowan said. But the county also wants to make sure companies can stay in business as they decarbonize — especially Cliffs, one of the largest sources of commerce at the city’s port.
In Lewis’ view, decarbonizing Cleveland Works earlier rather than later would be a smart business move for Cliffs. “I think the biggest thing is staying competitive,” Lewis said. 
One of Cliffs’ largest markets is supplying high-quality steel for automobiles, including electric vehicles, she added. In March, Hyundai announced plans to invest $6 billion in a new plant in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, that will [produce low-carbon steel](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/hyundai-low-carbon-steel-louisiana). As automakers face global pressure to source cleaner metal, Cliffs could find itself left behind, Lewis suggested.
The Industrious Labs report “opens the door for Cleveland to be a leader in clean steel,” Lewis said. Before that can happen, though, “there’s a lot of work to do.”","Green steel, Emissions reduction, Fossil fuels, Midwest, Ohio",cliffs-cleveland-works-blast-furnace-relining-climate-goals.md,articles_green-steel

The terms of the takeover are not yet clear. Later on Friday, after returning to Washington, Trump told reporters he still hadn’t granted the acquisition his final approval. 
“We haven’t seen that final deal yet,” he said, according to a White House

Steelmaking is one of the [most emissions-intensive sectors in the world](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/the-trillion-dollar-quest-to-make-green-steel), though it is fairly low-carbon in the U.S. due to the [prevalence of mini mills that recycle steel](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/us-iron-furnace-cleaner) using electric arc furnaces that don’t burn coal.
Nippon Steel has floated [some of the worst air quality](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/coal-steel-air-pollution-cities) in the U.S.

Though the deal terms remain opaque, Trump offered greater clarity — at least, for now — around the trade policy he said undergirded the deal. He said on Friday that he’d double tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%, a hike that 
Trump’s speech outside of Pittsburgh did little to clear confusion over his position on the deal, which has shifted over the last year.

He called Japan an “amazing country” with “great people.”
Just two weeks ago, however, the United Steelworkers union blasted Nippon as “a serial trade cheater” and accused Japan’s largest steel manufacturer of “simply seeking to undercut our domestic industry from the inside.”

Kaufman,"Most steelmakers rely on iron from polluting coal-fired blast furnaces. But exploding demand for “direct reduced iron” promises to slash the industry’s emissions.

Global demand for steel is 70% of the world’s supply. American steelmakers are less reliant on blast furnaces than other countries, but they are doubling down on plans to extend the lives of the handful still operating in the U.S.
As those same steelmakers plan new facilities, though, they are embracing a cleaner technology called direct reduced iron, or DRI, to purify iron ore, the first step in the production of primary steel.
The DRI process uses a high-temperature gas to remove oxygen from the ore. The remaining iron can then be added to a traditional basic oxygen furnace or, more commonly in modern systems equipped with DRI, to an electric arc furnace that can be powered by carbon-free electricity.
Most DRI plants operating today use natural gas, a fossil fuel primarily made up of planet-warming methane. But even those can [produce 50% less carbon emissions](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/cleaner-steelmaking-is-actually-starting-to-happen) than coal-fired blast furnaces — and if the technology can be paired with carbon capture or fueled instead by green hydrogen, carbon-free steel becomes a possibility.
While DRI facilities account for just 9% of global ironmaking capacity today, they comprise [only three DRI plants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/the-trillion-dollar-quest-to-make-green-steel#:~:text=\(The%20United%20States%20has%20three,a%20coal-fueled%20blast%20furnace.) up and running — but [every new ironmaking facility](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/us-iron-furnace-cleaner) slated to be built in the country will use DRI. That includes South Korean automaker Hyundai’s [planned DRI plant in Louisiana](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/hyundai-low-carbon-steel-louisiana), which the company announced in March.
The technology for DRI has existed for more than half a century, but it’s made exclusively by two firms that few outside the industry have ever heard of: 
## **The big two**
Midrex Technologies dominates the DRI market. The North Carolina-based company built the first U.S. plant using the technology in Portland, Oregon, in 1969.
“DRI has a bigger and bigger role to play in the energy transition. The long-term view for DRI is positive. Demand for DRI keeps increasing,” said Vincent Chevrier, Midrex’s general manager of technical sales and marketing. “It’s probably going to double, then triple, in the next 20 years.”
The other major manufacturer, Tenova — owned by the Buenos Aires-based Techint, with technology jointly developed with Italy’s steel giant Danieli — started making DRI technology at the turn of this century. With just a fraction of the market, the firm may be the underdog, but CEO Francesco Memoli sees an advantage.
Tenova’s technology can swap out natural gas for hydrogen without any modifications. While Midrex says its equipment needs only minor upgrades to optimize for hydrogen, Tenova said the innate flexibility of its system allows it to ride out whichever way the political tides turn in the U.S.
Lately those tides have been turning against green steel.
In January, just before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, the Swedish steelmaker SSAB [bowed out of negotiations](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/ssab-quietly-pulls-out-of-500m-green-steel-award-negotiations) for $500 million in federal funding the Biden administration had put up to support a DRI plant powered entirely with green hydrogen in Mississippi.
Cleveland-Cliffs — considered the more progressive of the American steelmakers — has suggested it would [abandon its plans](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/cleveland-cliffs-middletown-trump) to build a DRI facility and use hydrogen to produce steel at its Middletown, Ohio, plant as it renegotiates the $500 million grant it had been awarded with the Trump administration.
Weeks after Cleveland-Cliffs started backing away from the project, Nippon Steel [secured Trump’s approval](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/nippon-us-deal-trump-coal) to take over American rival U.S. Steel. The Japanese behemoth, the world’s fourth-largest steel producer, lags so far behind other companies in developing a decarbonization plan that the watchdog group SteelWatch recently described Nippon as “a coal company that also makes steel.” While Nippon has pledged to build a new electric arc furnace, a machine that uses electricity to turn scrap metal into fresh steel, the company has also staked out plans to extend the operations of U.S. Steel’s existing blast furnaces.
Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have proposed [eliminating the federal tax credit](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/green-industry-trump-tax-credits) meant to spur green hydrogen production, which would create yet another setback.
In the near term, most of the new DRI plants in the U.S. will likely run on gas, Memoli said. 
“Natural gas is very accessible in the U.S.,” he said.
Already, Tenova can capture some of the emissions from the gas it uses. Steelmaker Nucor deploys Tenova equipment at its plant in Louisiana, which last year DRI production. In 2023, Nucor DRI process.
In Mexico, the Latin American steelmaker Ternium funnels CO captured from Tenova’s DRI equipment to Coca-Cola, Memoli said. Tenova puts the gas through two rounds of cleaning until it’s safe for use in beverages, and sells it to another company that in turn supplies the CO to Coca-Cola.
“All of the soda produced in Mexico by Coca-Cola is using CO recycled from an ironmaking plant,” Memoli said. “The joke is that Mexican Coke tastes better because of that.”
While the CO emitted by the DRI process is captured in the Tenova system, Memoli said the carbon produced from heating the gas to 1,000 degrees Celsius remains a source of pollution. The company is planning to roll out new features in the next few years to capture even that “residual” CO.
Elsewhere, the company’s equipment is already running on hydrogen, or will be soon.
Last year, a major Swedish green metal project 100% hydrogen for the steelmaking giant SSAB. The fuel is gaining ground in China, too, which lacks domestic gas resources. Tenova-equipped plants in the world’s second-largest economy are already churning out 700,000 tons of iron per year using anywhere from 30% to 70% hydrogen, Memoli said, though only some of that hydrogen is green. The world produces about 
Despite the headwinds for hydrogen-based steelmaking in the U.S., the industry could still move away from traditional steel plants (also called integrated plants because of their use of blast furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces) in the coming years. Industry analysts say DRI is the technology that will enable this shift — one that some say is critical both economically and for the climate.
“Blast furnace technology is outdated — full stop. It’s too dirty, it’s too energy intensive, and it’s too inefficient,” said Elizabeth Boatman, a lead consultant at 5 Lakes Energy, a Michigan-based research firm. “Overhauling our integrated mill fleet will be expensive, but it’s an investment that will pay off in the long term.”
Already, mini mills across the U.S. make use of the large volumes of scrap metal in the U.S. to produce lower-carbon steel than what coal-fired plants in China make fresh.
“What we are seeing, because of the switch of energy from coal, is that it offers the possibility of decoupling ironmaking from steelmaking,” said Midrex’s Chevrier. “You can place your ironmaking facility where the energy is cheap, and maintain your steelmaking facility at the location where your customers are and your scrap is.”
That could also create an opening for some of the startups looking to popularize next-generation ironmaking techniques. The Colorado-based company Electra, which aims to use a process called “electrowinning” to purify iron without a blast furnace, [raised $186 million](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/electra-clean-iron-investment-electrowinning) in April to support its scale-up. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology green steel spin-off Boston Metal, meanwhile, is [inching toward its first commercial revenue](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/boston-metal-decarbonization-technology).
Memoli said Tenova’s own research and development teams are working on similar technology. But he warned that it’s unlikely to be able to scale up fast enough in the near term to compete with DRI or blast furnaces.
A medium-sized blast furnace can churn out enough iron for 3 million tons of steel per year. A DRI plant can reach about 2.5 million tons. It’ll be decades before any of these newer electricity-based technologies reach that scale, Memoli said.
“The level of development of those technologies is still at a very early stage,” he said.
“We’re still talking about 20 years, 30 years from now. We need to be conscious of what are the targets and what are the deadlines today,” he added. “If we wait for something like that, the target of cleaning the planet will be pushed down and the cost of cleaning the planet will be much higher.”
Memoli said he wants to see more competition in the DRI space.
“Today there are only two companies – us and Midrex. Two is not enough,” Memoli said. “Not even four would be enough to develop all the projects that potentially could happen. Anybody with a green solution is welcome.”","Green steel, Clean industry",direct-reduced-iron-tenova-midrex.md,articles_green-steel

Green steel proponents want a transition away from polluting coal-based steelmaking instead.

Qiyam Ansari was driving to work the morning of Aug. 11 when he felt and saw an explosion occur just down the road in Clairton, Pennsylvania. Thick black smoke burst from the U.S. Steel facility along the Monongahela River, filling the air with an acrid stench, and the ground began shuddering from a series of blasts.
The 10 others, some of whom were trapped under charred rubble. For about an hour, brownish clouds rose from the wreckage of the facility, which processes coal for use in steelmaking.
“The smell of ammonia was insane,” Ansari said, recalling the first few minutes after the initial blast. “It burned my throat, my nostrils, and my eyes started to water. It was horrible.”
Ansari is the executive director of Valley Clean Air Now, a community-led organization, and his office in Glassport sits across the river from Clairton. As soon as he arrived at work, he slipped on a face mask, turned on air purifiers, and began alerting residents to take the same precautions.
U.S. Steel, now a subsidiary of Japan-based Nippon Steel, said it is working with authorities to determine the cause of the tragic event at the Clairton coking factory. The companies also reaffirmed their plans to invest in the 109-year-old operation — the largest of its kind in North America, and one of four U.S. Steel plants in the Mon Valley complex near Pittsburgh.
“You can count on this facility to be around for a long, long time,” U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt said at an Aug. 12

Even before the explosion, the coking plant was plagued with equipment failures and excessive air pollution, for which U.S. Steel has paid millions in fines and legal settlements in recent years.
In the long run, however, what to do with Clairton and other coal-based operations remains an [open and urgent question](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/the-trillion-dollar-quest-to-make-green-steel) for America’s steel industry — one that has major implications for the climate and the nation’s legacy steel communities.
Producing iron and steel is an extremely dirty business, responsible for as much as 9% of global carbon dioxide emissions and a [significant amount of toxic air pollution](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/making-steel-with-clean-energy-would-curb-health-risks-report-says). In the United States, seven coal-based steel mills and 11 coking plants are still operating across Pennsylvania, Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and West Virginia.
Many of the facilities are aging and in need of extensive repairs. In June, Nippon Steel committed to spending $2.4 billion in the Mon Valley as part of a $11 billion capital investment in U.S. Steel’s footprints through 2028. Nippon has pledged to transfer its “advanced technologies” to the sites, though it hasn’t shared specific plans. (Nippon didn’t immediately return requests for comment.)
Meanwhile, the Trump administration is boosting federal support for fossil-fuel-based steelmaking, including by 
Environmental groups are urging steelmakers to instead chart a new course for the industry by investing in modern and low-carbon methods for manufacturing iron and steel.
“If there are going to be future investments, it doesn’t make sense to extend the life of these really old, outdated processes that don’t help the climate and don’t help community health,” said Matt Mehalik, executive director of the Breathe Project, a coalition of about 50 local advocacy groups in southwestern Pennsylvania.
“It makes sense to talk about what would position steelmaking for the 21st century,” he added.
## **Making metal — with or without coke**
When U.S. Steel opened the Clairton Coke Works in the early 20th century, Pennsylvania was the beating heart of America’s steel industry, thanks to the region’s abundant coal deposits.
Coking plants bake metallurgical coal in ovens at high temperatures to remove impurities that could weaken steel. Along with purified “coke,” the process produces a litany of hazardous air pollutants, such as lead and arsenic, and it creates a lethal gas byproduct that contains methane, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide.
The coke is used in what’s known as “integrated” steelmaking. Coke is combined with iron ore and limestone in a scorching-hot blast furnace to produce iron. The molten metal is then moved into a basic oxygen furnace where it becomes steel — the essential and abundant material used in bridges, buildings, ships, cars, and household appliances.
The number of U.S. coal-based steelmaking facilities has declined over the decades, owing largely to growing competition overseas and shifting market conditions at home. No new steel facilities that use coal have been built in the U.S. in decades. Today, roughly 30% of the country’s steel production is made the traditional way.
The remaining 70% of domestic steel output comes from electric arc furnaces, many of which are scattered across the U.S. South. These giant facilities use electricity to melt scrap metal — a method that can significantly curb CO emissions and reduce air pollution compared to using coal, especially if that electricity is being generated with clean energy.
But recycled steel can’t entirely displace demand for high-strength “primary” steel. In order to truly clean up steelmaking, the industry must end its reliance on coal, experts say.
“We know that there are alternatives that don’t involve coke-making,” Hilary Lewis, steel director at Industrious Labs, said days after the Clairton explosion. “And if we have ways to do this that are safer for workers, safer for communities, we should be seriously considering them.”
Today, the leading alternative for coke-fed blast furnaces is the “direct reduced iron” process, or DRI. Existing DRI plants typically use fossil gas to convert iron ore into iron, which is relatively cleaner than using coal. But if producers swapped gas for green hydrogen — made with renewable power — they could slash the overall CO emissions from steelmaking by up to 90%.
The iron can then be melted into steel in an electric arc furnace, ideally one that’s also powered by carbon-free electricity, though that’s not typically the case today.
## **Green steel’s path is still uncertain in U.S.**
For now, this fossil-fuel-free arrangement mostly remains out of reach, given the challenging economics and the persistent lack of green hydrogen supplies globally.
A handful of commercial-scale projects are slowly advancing in Europe and [China](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/china-us-competition-dri-hydrogen). But plans to build two hydrogen-based steel mills in the United States have recently been abandoned.
Last year, the steelmakers SSAB and Cleveland-Cliffs were selected to receive up to $500 million each from the Biden-era Department of Energy to [build green steel facilities](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/us-pledges-up-to-1b-for-two-pioneering-green-steel-projects) in Mississippi and Ohio, respectively. In January, SSAB told Canary Media it had [withdrawn from federal award negotiations](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/ssab-quietly-pulls-out-of-500m-green-steel-award-negotiations). In July, Cleveland-Cliffs said it “beautiful coal, beautiful coke, beautiful natural gas.”
The Trump administration is encouraging the U.S. steel industry to double down on coal. In May, Energy Secretary Chris Wright “critical material” for the U.S. supply chain. The GOP megalaw passed last month allows coal producers to claim the advanced manufacturing tax credit through 2029, helping to reduce the cost of coal-based steelmaking, both domestically and in countries that import U.S. metallurgical coal.
Most notably for Clairton Coke Works, the Environmental Protection Agency recently 2027. The rules set caps on previously unregulated air pollutants. They also required plants to monitor pollution — a measure that can provide key data about a community’s exposure risk following major accidents.
In the wake of the fatal explosion at Clairton, the Allegheny County Health Department said it was 
For Ansari, of Valley Clean Air Now, the last few days have been a hectic blur. His group has managed to donate hundreds of air purifiers across the Mon Valley, and he’s been encouraging residents to have their blood drawn to document any potential chemical exposure from the blast.
“The community has definitely responded and rallied around us, and I’m very grateful for that,” he said. “But it’s unfortunate, because I feel like all of this could have been avoided.”

https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydropower/canadian-hydroelectric-new-england-cutoff,"In New England, Canadian hydropower has slowed to an ominous trickle",31 March 2025,Sarah Shemkus,"Whether due to drought, prices, or politics, the weekslong disappearance of Canadian hydropower from New England’s grid exposes risks for the region.

On March 6, at the start of the still-simmering trade war between the U.S. and Canada, hydropower generator Hydro‑Québec quietly stopped exporting electricity to New England.
At a time of year when Canadian hydropower typically supplies up to a tenth of New England’s power, the region has instead gone almost a month with virtually no cross-border flow of electrons.
Hydro‑Québec leaders say low prices in the New England market — not politics — are behind the decision to suspend sales. The disruption hasn’t affected power costs or reliability in the region yet, but some experts say it could if the cutoff extends into the summer cooling season. The situation also highlights a potential risk to state clean energy plans that count on Canadian hydropower to help offset fossil fuels.
“This shows the potential for the region to be vulnerable to manipulations of the supply,” said Phelps Turner, director of clean grid for the Conservation Law Foundation.
Hydro‑Québec’s main transmission line into New England, known as the Phase II line, stopped exporting any meaningful amount of power two days after President Donald Trump’s tariff on Canadian imports went into effect. Last March, by comparison, anywhere from a few hundred megawatts to more than 1,200 MW flowed along the line at any given time, making up between 5% and 10% of the region’s electricity use on average, Turner estimated.
The longer that New England needs to replace the absent hydropower, the more often it will call on natural gas or oil power plants to fill the gap with dirtier and more expensive electricity, particularly as demand increases in the summer and again next winter.
“Electrically, this is pretty much the most boring time of year, and certainly a much easier time of year to have a source go away or be on pause here,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association. “There is going to be both a cost and environmental consequence if we see this be a really durable situation.”
## **The future of Canadian energy in New England**
In an email from a company spokesperson, Hydro‑Québec attributed its lack of exports to market conditions, saying milder spring weather has lowered demand and thus prices. Others have theorized the move is also a show of power 
Hydro‑Québec has been sending signals for a while that it might be moving away from delivering power to New England at its historic levels. Last year, 5,560 gigawatt-hours of power traveled into the region over the Phase II line, less than half the amount exported in 2022. And in the last two forward capacity auctions run by grid operator ISO New England, Hydro‑Québec did not take on any obligation to provide power for 20 of the 24 months covered.
This pullback is likely due, at least in part, to ongoing abnormally dry and drought conditions in much of Quebec, which mean less water flow to power the company’s generators. Hydro-Québec, therefore, faces choices about what to do with the power it can generate, whether that means holding out for higher prices on the New England market or selling it domestically to meet the province’s own growing demand as it too electrifies in pursuit of climate goals.
“Hydro-Québec is proactively managing its energy reserves in the context of low runoff and, as such, will continue to limit its exports as it did in 2024,” said company spokesperson Lynn St-Laurent.
The lack of exports from Hydro-Québec coupled with the specter of fluctuating tariffs and counter-tariffs brings into focus the need for the New England grid to develop more stateside power resources and expand the infrastructure required to get energy where it’s needed, experts said.
“We’re going to need all the supply we can find, and part of that is going to come from Canadian hydro,” said Jeremy McDiarmid, managing director and general counsel at clean energy industry association Advanced Energy United. “We also need to be building things: We need to build transmission lines. We need to build new generation.”
Some are also concerned that ISO New England is not properly accounting for the declines in Canadian hydro supply. The grid operator’s planning process still uses the assumption that neighboring regions — mostly Quebec, Dolan said — will be willing and able to send 2,000 MW into New England at moments of exceptionally high demand, an expectation Dolan said “doesn’t strike me as responsible or appropriate reliability planning,” given the trend in the Canadian firm’s exports.
The situation has also raised questions about the 145-mile project designed to import 1,200 MW of Hydro-Québec power into New England as part of a 20-year power purchase agreement with Massachusetts utilities. The line is expected to be operational starting in 2026, and a Hydro-Québec spokesperson said the company plans to deliver the power promised.
Recent circumstances, however, have those in the industry combing over the contracts to determine how solid Hydro-Québec’s commitment to deliver that power actually is and how tariffs might affect the terms of the deal. One promising sign, they said: The company is still sending electricity into the U.S. over a second, smaller transmission line that ends in Vermont, which has an agreement to buy power from Hydro-Québec until 2038.
“That does seem to suggest that [Hydro-Québec] is performing under existing contracts,” Turner said. “But every contract in every situation is different.”
In the meantime, the region will just have to wait and see what Hydro-Québec does next, without much information to go on.
“It’s hard to say what’s motivating the decision” to cut power flow, Turner said. “We just know it’s happening, but we don’t know why it’s happening.”","Hydropower, Clean energy, Northeast",canadian-hydroelectric-new-england-cutoff.md,articles_hydropower

These Tesla Megablocks can store solar power after the sun sets. (Tesla)
LAS VEGAS — On Monday night in a subterranean hall under the Las Vegas Convention Center, Tesla released an upgraded version of its grid-battery product that will allow developers to build bigger energy-storage projects faster. That kind of acceleration is sorely needed as the storage industry positions itself to meet historic grid demand in the next few years.
While better known for its pioneering electric-car business, and the polarizing antics of CEO Elon Musk, the company is also a pacesetter in the fast-growing U.S. energy-storage industry.
Tesla’s white boxy Megapack product, which stitches together lithium-ion batteries inside a large container, has been a top competitor for years. Around the U.S., Megapacks play a crucial role in keeping the lights on: In Oahu, they [enabled](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/a-huge-battery-has-replaced-hawaiis-last-coal-plant) the safe retirement of Hawaii’s last coal plant; in Oxnard, California, they [allowed](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/environmental-justice-activists-in-california-fight-off-a-new-gas-plant) the city to avoid building a gas plant on its coastline; across Texas, they’re helping lower electricity prices and avoid shortfalls during record heat waves, as are batteries from companies like Fluence and Wärtsilä.
But the storage industry is still young, with plenty of room to streamline operations and bring down costs. That’s what Tesla hopes to do with the new Megablock, which packages four Megapacks around one transformer. 
One of these blocks holds 20 megawatt-hours of power, which can be discharged for up to four hours at peak capacity. Scaled up for a large project, 248 megawatt-hours can fit into an acre (for comparison, the [Oxnard project](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/environmental-justice-activists-in-california-fight-off-a-new-gas-plant) packed in about 200 megawatt-hours per acre using earlier-generation Megapacks back in 2021). 
Tesla is taking orders for Megablocks now and expects to ship starting in late 2026. The firm will manufacture them near Houston, with lithium-iron-phosphate batteries from multiple sources, including a 7-gigawatt-hour-per-year manufacturing line planned to be completed at the company’s Nevada Gigafactory in early 2026.
The timing is no coincidence. Tesla’s new announcement comes as AI computing gobbles up electricity in unfathomable quantities. The rapid construction of new power sources has emerged as a defining imperative for America’s tech industry as it races to achieve what it sees as the transformative benefits of advanced AI. President Donald Trump has claimed that global AI supremacy is a key priority, even as his administration has taken aggressive steps to choke off development of the nation’s fastest-growing sources of energy.
##  **What the new Tesla Megapack does differently**
Tesla says the Megablock design will allow developers to deploy 1 gigawatt-hour’s worth of storage in just 20 business days. That’s an astonishing rate, if borne out in real-world conditions. The firm has made bold claims in the past that have failed to materialize on time if at all, like its visions of a [widely adopted solar roof](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/tesla-has-installed-very-few-solar-roofs-despite-elon-musks-hype) or a 
The Megablock’s main innovations are that it reduces the amount of electrical work required in the field while also packing in battery cells as densely as possible without going over the weight limit that triggers expensive specialized shipping protocols. 
“For us, one of the key metrics was, what’s the maximum percent cell mass you can get?” said Mike Snyder, Tesla’s VP of energy and charging, in an interview after his presentation. “Because the cells are what matters. So we made sure we increased that. It’s an 86,000-pound box, and 75% of that is cell.”
A giant battery installation requires thousands of perfectly executed electrical connections, and mishaps can cause major problems. Megapacks come with their batteries pre-wired, allowing for factory-grade quality controls. But currently, each pack then needs to be connected to a medium-voltage transformer to ship power in and out, which takes up to 24 individual connections per pack.
“That’s just a lot of labor in the field, and it’s a lot of places where something can go wrong,” Snyder said. “One of those bolts, one of those cables, it causes downtime and you have to go fix it.” 
The new Megablock, in contrast, needs just three connections per pack.
##  **Notes from the battery underground**
Tesla timed the unveiling for the opening night of RE+, the bustling solar and clean energy industry conference, but hosted it on Musk-affiliated turf: a station for his side project boring holes under the Las Vegas Convention Center. Attendees were invited to experience the thrill of being chauffeured in a manually driven Tesla through a one-lane tunnel — not necessarily a harbinger of the future of transport, but it was lit by colorful LEDs. 
Musk himself was not on hand, but Snyder addressed the crowd from a stage that was also lit by LEDs and flanked by Cybertrucks and Tesla’s new humanoid automatons. The screen behind him lit up with sharply produced drone footage of massive Megapack installations in lush locales.
The spectacle offered an implicit riposte to the Trump Department of Energy, which a few days earlier had “Wind and solar energy infrastructure is essentially worthless when it is dark outside, and the wind is not blowing.” The claim reflected either a remarkable ignorance of energy storage, a longtime research and deployment priority of that very same department, or a desire to pretend batteries don’t exist. 
Batteries accounted for [23% of new grid-scale capacity](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-96-percent-of-new-us-power-capacity-was-carbon-free-in-2024) built in the U.S. last year, compared to just 4% of new capacity that came from the fossil-gas plants much admired by the Trump administration. 
## **How to make a better battery**
While Tesla’s CEO spent hundreds of millions getting Trump elected and a few months slashing the federal civil service, Tesla’s engineers kept hacking away at the problem of making better batteries.
The attention to detail goes down to the paint job. 
If you look at enough photos of grid battery projects, they blur into beige anonymity. But seeing the Megablock up close, the coat of white paint held more allure than it does from afar, more of a pearlescent sheen. A Tesla tour guide told me the shade was selected to maximize reflection of heat from the sun, thus reducing the energy needed to keep the batteries cool. The central chamber of the Megapack features a supercharged version of a Model Y heat pump, borrowed from colleagues on the automotive side of the company to chill liquid cooling streams that keep Megapack batteries and inverters safe.
These Megablocks are not beige. (Tesla)
Also taking in the sight was Tyler Norris, a Duke University doctoral student and leading researcher on 
“The U.S. is just in a major capacity crunch right now,” Norris said. “We’re going to need all sources of peaking capacity that we can get, and battery storage and the Megapack solutions are a critical option.”
The U.S. is expected to build 18 GW of batteries this year, per federal data, up from 13 GW last year, with California and Texas continuing to lead the way. Trump’s actions have injected deeper uncertainty into the market in 2025, with tariff fluctuations and new anti-China regulations. But the big tax-and-spending law passed by Republicans in July kept energy-storage tax incentives in place for years to come, even as it gutted wind and solar tax credits, meaning the outlook for storage is less muted than it is for the renewables it’s often paired with.
Meanwhile, data centers haven’t yet become big installers of on-site batteries, Norris added, but that could start to happen in the next couple of years. The typical four-hour duration of commercially available batteries today doesn’t lend itself to a round-the-clock power supply, so data-center developers are still figuring out how best to slot batteries into their energy portfolios.

China’s dominance of the battery supply chain is uncontested. Many U.S. storage companies have tried to catch up by replicating the technologies already in mass production there. But a smaller cohort is [taking a different tack](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/batteries/the-case-for-more-novel-battery-manufacturing-startups): building factories for next-generation batteries that could give American manufacturers more of a competitive edge.
2023, took a big step this summer when it shipped its first sodium-based grid-battery system for installation in the field. The 875-kilowatt/3.5-megawatt-hour battery is now being completed in Watkins, Colorado, at a testing facility known as the Solar Technology Acceleration Center.
In fairness, the battery cells were imported from China, but Peak designed and built a new enclosure for them in Burlingame, California. Since the sodium batteries are especially rugged, Peak could forgo the temperature-control equipment needed for the current favorite chemistry for grid storage, lithium ferrous phosphate (LFP). If this first installation works well and the cost savings are as consequential as promised, Peak plans to build U.S. manufacturing for the whole package, cells and all.
The installation is a rare bright spot as the storage industry at large grapples with the impacts of Trump administration energy policy. President Donald Trump’s unpredictably shifting [tariffs on China](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/tariffs-tax-credits-grid-battery-trump) have raised the costs of imported batteries and made it hard to plan. The White House’s signature budget law [ripped up some — but not all — tax credits](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/tax-credit-changes-trump-law) meant to support domestic manufacturing of batteries, and added dense new [bureaucratic requirements](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/china-foreign-entity-rules-trump) around components from China. [New investment in domestic clean-energy manufacturing](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-manufacturing/trump-investments-drop-ira) has plummeted since Trump took office.

Upstart battery-makers often jockey over how much energy density they can pack into their cells, or how they can reduce the fire risks that follow from squeezing so much energy into a tight footprint. Peak Energy brags more about what its technology doesn’t need: heavy-duty climate control.
“If you think about it, an LFP [energy storage system] is essentially a giant refrigerator that has to operate flawlessly for 20 years in the desert,” said Cameron Dales, Peak’s chief commercial officer and cofounder. That’s because that particular chemistry ideally needs to stay within a few degrees of 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit) to preserve its useful life; serious deviations from that safe zone could lead to declining performance or even dangerous failures. A handful of [dramatic battery fires](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/moss-landing-fire-reveals-flaws-in-the-battery-industrys-early-designs) has already inspired community pushback against storage plants, making safety a crucial part of the industry’s social license. Indeed, this week U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin 
The sodium-ion cells that Peak favors — technically called sodium iron pyrophosphate or NFPP — can withstand a much broader range of temperatures, from minus 20 degrees C (minus 4 degrees F) to 45 degrees C (113 degrees F). Peak’s engineers thus dispensed with the usual battery-cooling systems, relying instead on what Dales calls “clever engineering” around how the cells fit into the broader package. “There’s no moving parts, no fans, no liquids, no pumps, no nothing,” he said. The container does include a solid-state heater to ensure the cells never get too cold to charge.
This saves money by reducing the cost of materials and cutting auxiliary power usage up to 90% over the life of the project. But axing the conventional safety equipment brings one more major benefit, because that hardware has paradoxically [caused several of the recent high-profile grid-battery fires](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/tesla-grid-battery-fire-shows-young-industrys-failures-and-successes) (by, for example, erroneously spraying water on live batteries, which can make a fire where there wasn’t one).
A rendering of Peak's battery system (Peak Energy)
Plenty of cleantech startups have pitched themselves as safer alternatives to dominant strains of lithium-ion batteries, only to be crushed mercilessly by the lithium-ion manufacturing juggernaut. Overwhelming scale and a wealth of industrial expertise keep pushing mainstream batteries to lower prices and superior performance. However, the up-front costs of the batteries themselves are now just a small piece of the overall bill.
“What has not really been addressed is the construction and installation of a project, and then, even more importantly, the long-term operating costs associated with running that power plant,” Dales said.
According to Dales’ calculations, the energy savings from the passive cooling of Peak Energy’s battery enclosure over a period of 20 years more than cover the initial cost of the battery cells. That’s one way to lure customers to a type of battery they haven’t seen before.
“How can a startup, who’s just getting up to speed and their costs are high and volume is not there yet, compete and win on a project like that?” he said. “It’s because these project economics are so good that even today, we can win on cost relative to … a Chinese LFP system.”
## **Lining up customers now to avoid getting “piloted to death”**
Flipping the switch on the Colorado project is just the start. Then Peak Energy needs to find paying customers interested in much bigger versions of the technology. But the startup has an innovative plan for that next step.
The founders of many battery startups focus on a technology that they find interesting (maybe they chose it for their doctoral research years ago), and then at some point have to convince customers to buy it. This typically leads to what Dales identified as “a classic failure mode, to get piloted to death.” The eager startup spends its precious time developing insignificant yet money-losing pilot installations with lukewarm customers, who try it for a few years and decline to make a follow-up purchase. Then the startup runs out of cash and collapses.
Peak Energy’s founders decided on a different strategy: develop a product in conversation with prospective customers, so they actually want to buy it when it’s ready.
The Colorado project, paid for by Peak, will be scrutinized by a consortium of nine utilities and independent power producers, who have signed on to receive exclusive performance data. If the project meets agreed-upon metrics, these companies will buy Peak’s product for their own use.
“If we do what we say we’re going to do, and the economics are what we think they are, then you should sign up for doing a real project, because it actually makes sense for you,” Dales explained. “That’s how these companies have entered the program, and now we’re in the ‘proof is in the pudding’ phase.”
Some of those consortium members have requested batteries for demonstration projects in 2026, in the storage range of 10 MWh to 50 MWh, Dales said. One large power developer is working on a 2027 project that would deploy nearly one gigawatt-hour of Peak’s sodium batteries to support a hyperscaler data center.
The path from initial installation to giga-scale projects always takes longer than battery startups initially pledge. In fact, only lithium-ion batteries have crossed that threshold, while more unusual variants languish in the minor leagues.
But Peak doesn’t have to invent the core technology — it’s piggybacking off an emerging field of China’s battery industry — and it’s coming to market at a time of propulsive growth in grid storage demand. Its task might not be quite so daunting as it has been for other battery innovators.","Batteries, Clean energy manufacturing, Energy storage, West",peak-energy-sodium-cool-first-installation.md,articles_batteries

_THE CITY. __to get the latest_ _delivered to you each morning._
When a heat wave hits New York City, many customers can soon expect a message from Con Edison, 
The reason is to protect the heat-strained electric grid, which, when taxed to the point of failure, can lead to blackouts and brownouts. 
Addy Spiller, an Upper West Sider and founder of a product management business, said those messages from Con Ed drive her bananas.
“Listen, I don’t know how to use less electricity,” she said. “I already have the AC at a reasonable temperature. I don’t think I can do enough to help Con Ed on my own.”
But this summer, Spiller and her dog, Ranger, are among 65 households across the city actually doing more to help — and they don’t have to stop blasting their ACs on sweltering days. That’s because they’re participating in an experiment that connects their air conditioning units to small batteries in their homes. The batteries, about the size of a small microwave oven, plug into wall sockets.
The pilot program, called AC units with the battery instead of the electric grid.
“There’s a class of large portable phone chargers almost, and instead of powering a whole building, they power a single device and take it off the grid,” said Andrew Wang, Standard Potential’s CEO. “Because we have the battery, it allows folks to participate in the program without having to adjust their comfort levels.”
If more New Yorkers were to connect electric appliances to batteries in their homes, this approach could make the city more resilient, add to the stability of the electric grid, and keep people cool. Responsible Grid is one of 
Participants who have the freely provided batteries in their homes through September will also receive about $100 per air conditioning unit plugged into them from Responsible Grid, as Con Ed pays the company to reduce demand.
In southeast Queens, participant Farudh Emiel noticed several times over the hottest days of the summer that his three air conditioning units plugged into the batteries he got through the pilot program kept pumping even as he saw lights dimming. It was likely Con Ed reduced the voltage in his neighborhood to protect the electric system, but his AC units, relying on the batteries, were unaffected.
“I run my ACs 24/7, three of them at the same time,” Emiel said. “One thing I will spend money on is electricity because I don’t want to sweat.”
Outside the individual homes of the participants, batteries have the potential to reshape the electric-supply system and protect ratepayers’ wallets.
When demand for power is high, especially in the summer, fossil-fuel-fired peaker plants kick in to meet that need. Those plants, often located in and around low-income neighborhoods, can be highly polluting and costly to rely on.
“By switching your AC to a battery rather than the outlet, you’re providing a measure of relief to the grid, avoiding more expensive, dirtier power plants turning on,” said Jamie Dickerson, senior director of climate and clean energy programs at Acadia Center, a research and advocacy nonprofit.
The small batteries in participants’ homes have served as a source of backup power in other instances.
In the midst of a heat wave in July, Emiel had just finished cooking a meal when the power went out in his neighborhood. He scurried around his home — a detached, multistory house — to connect his refrigerator, WiFi router, and TV to the batteries.
“We were the only house with electricity because of the stand-alone batteries,” said Emiel, who works as a policy manager for a clean-energy advocacy organization. “We had internet still, we were charging our phones, we had a lamp connected. The air conditioning was still working.”
The blackout lasted for about four hours, he said.
Spiller, too, relied on her batteries in early June, when her prewar apartment building had a planned electrical outage to do some upgrades. The day was hot, and she began feeling stressed as she wondered where she should bring her dog and how she’d get her work done. But then she remembered the battery.
“With the battery, I was able to continue working. My AC worked, my WiFi worked,” Spiller said. “It was such a relief to realize I had a little bit of a buffer and didn’t have to leave my house — I was able to continue just living.”

But connecting big batteries to the grid requires navigating lots of red tape and finding major real estate, two tough tasks in New York City that can slow down adoption.
Jesse Jenkins, a professor in energy and engineering at Princeton University, called the pilot a “compelling model and a good way to avoid the very high costs and bureaucratic headaches of trying to install a grid-connected home battery or solar system.”
But he added that eventually, getting more customers to put the batteries “comes down to the cost of these devices, and whether the value delivered exceeds that cost.”
Looking ahead, Wang said he’s looking forward to scaling up the program to include more participants next summer, and to potentially try pairing the batteries with electric heat pumps in the winter.","Batteries, Utilities, Northeast, New York",coned-nyc-ac-pilot-grid-impact.md,articles_batteries
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/sea-transport/new-york-first-hybrid-electric-ferry,NYC just launched its first hybrid-electric ferry,20 August 2025,Maria Gallucci,"The Harbor Charger is now cruising New York Harbor, cutting down on and diesel pollution. The vessel joins a tiny but growing U.S. fleet of cleaner boats.

NEW YORK — Just off the chaotic coastline of Lower Manhattan sits Governors Island, a tranquil oasis of tree-lined paths that the city is transforming into a hub for climate change research. Getting there, however, has long meant riding on a diesel-burning ferry that spews soot and planet-warming gases as it zips across the New York Harbor.
A new ferry now provides visitors a much cleaner way to reach the 172-acre island.
Harbor Charger, a hybrid-electric vessel, 12, elected officials and other leaders joined the ferry’s inaugural cruise around the harbor, roasting in the late-summer heat on the outside car deck.
“We’re proud to be charting the course for sustainable maritime transportation,” said Clare Newman, president and CEO of the Trust for Governors Island, a nonprofit created by New York City to redevelop the island. Later, Newman smashed a champagne bottle on the stern to christen the new vessel.
The $33 million Harbor Charger operates like an incredibly robust Toyota Prius. The boat’s diesel-fueled generators charge up the 870-kilowatt-hour battery system, allowing the vessel to run partly or fully on electricity during the eight-minute trip to or from the island. The ferry will eventually plug in directly to a shoreside rapid-charging station, using the generators only as emergency backup, but the charging infrastructure hasn’t yet been built.
Harbor Charger, which can fit up to 1,200 people and 30 vehicles, will replace its 69-year-old predecessor named Lt. Samuel S. Coursen. The older ferry guzzles an average of 420 gallons of diesel per day, so switching to the hybrid vessel is expected to save the city over $200,000 per year in fuel costs, according to the Trust for Governors Island.
The new boat will also significantly reduce air pollution and slash carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 600 tons per year when running in hybrid mode. Once it can plug in, the vessel will curb CO by an additional 800 tons.
Nationwide, many of the nearly 
“Diesel ferries are an important part of our transportation system, but continuing to spew the fumes that diesel leaves and … burn that fuel in the middle of our cities does not make any sense,” New York state Sen. Brian Kavanagh (D) said from the gently humming Harbor Charger. Skyscrapers towered in the distance as helicopters and seaplanes soared noisily overhead.
The newly built Harbor Charger is the second hybrid-electric ferry to launch in the U.S. this summer. In July, Washington State Ferries began running 27-year-old diesel ferry that underwent a $96 million conversion to become a Prius of the seas. The giant ferry can carry nearly 2,500 passengers and over 200 vehicles on a route between Seattle and Bainbridge Island.
Siemens Energy outfitted both ferries with its hybrid technology. The German manufacturer recently equipped a 
“We really think that this is the direction the industry is going,” Schwarz said in an interview as the Harbor Charger cruised past the Statue of Liberty.
For now, the industry will have to chart that course without key federal funding. The GOP megalaw that President Donald Trump [signed last month](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/trump-big-beautiful-bill-industry-impacts) rescinds millions of dollars in unobligated grant money from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act to help local governments and others slash diesel pollution from ports by modernizing and electrifying equipment.
New York City itself 2023 to fund the installation of Harbor Charger’s shoreside charging infrastructure, which is currently in the design phase. U.S. Rep. Dan Goldman (D-NY), who helped to secure the grant, lamented the loss of federal subsidies for projects like this one. “It is a very fraught time for our cleantech and our renewable energy,” he said during the launch ceremony.
Still, Goldman added, Harbor Charger “is such a critical example of what the future can be and will be.”","Marine transport, Electrification, Transportation, Northeast, New York",new-york-first-hybrid-electric-ferry.md,articles_sea-transport

Caulking around windows and other home retrofits can lower energy bills for households. In North Carolina, Energy Savers Network has provided such weatherization upgrades for around 1,400 homes since 2016. (Jim West/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)
Talia Boyd was spending over $300 a month to keep her home just outside Asheville, North Carolina, cool this summer. It was an enormous sum for the single-wide trailer she shares with her baby daughter and teenage son.
“We constantly kept ceiling fans going, and I had to get AC units,” she said — multiple ones that ran 24/7 to replace the cold air seeping out from gaps around the windows.
But now, the air leaks have been sealed, a door has been replaced, and a new [heat pump](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/air-conditioning-replacement-guide) has been installed — all at no cost to Boyd. Her monthly utility bill from Duke Energy has been cut in half, she said.
The improvements are thanks to 
“They really came out and they helped,” said Boyd, who works in home health care. “They talked. They took measurements. They walked through the whole trailer. I really appreciate the help, and I would love to spread the word.”
Boyd’s home is among the roughly 1,400 that [Energy Savers Network](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/how-an-asheville-nonprofit-is-working-to-reduce-energy-burdens-in-buncombe-county-n-c) has assisted with weatherization since its inception in late 2016. Across the state in the same time frame, thousands of other households have received similar services, mostly from community action agencies deploying federal dollars.
But Boyd’s story is somewhat unique. She’s in a smaller subset of people who’ve benefited from a Duke initiative meant not just to aid the energy burdened in times of crisis, but to permanently reduce their electricity use through home efficiency improvements.
And with politicians at the [state](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/emissions-reduction/north-carolina-ditch-duke-goal-now-what) and national levels turning against the clean energy transition in [low-income communities](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/trump-looks-to-kill-solar-for-all-just-as-it-starts-to-deliver?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=canary) and elsewhere, Boyd’s experience is rare good news that advocates hope can continue to be replicated.
## **From utility bill assistance to energy efficiency**
Energy Savers Network found Boyd through Duke’s Customer Assistance Program. Part of [a side deal the utility struck in 2023](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/as-duke-energy-rate-hikes-loom-in-n-c-deal-could-lessen-blow-for-energy-burdened) to lessen the blow of its rate hikes, the program offers a monthly credit of up to $42 on bills for households at or below 150% of the federal poverty level — about $50,000 for a family of four.
In 2024, Duke began automatically providing the credit to any customers who’d benefited in the prior year from one of two buckets of federal aid: the 
North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services manages the two funds and has a data-sharing agreement with Duke, which then enrolls customers in its program — a process that has minimized administrative expenses such as vetting participants for eligibility.
And though in its first year the bill assistance benefited [less than half the number of households](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/north-carolina-duke-energy-bill-assistance-weatherization) forecast, experts say that’s because funding for the two buckets of federal aid dropped, not because the need isn’t great. Advocates remain bullish about the prospect for Duke to serve 100,000 customers or more annually.
Totaling over $500 for a year, the bill credit alone is vital for families struggling to make ends meet, aid groups say.
But Boyd’s case demonstrates the full potential of the Customer Assistance Program: Virtually every household receiving help gets referred to a local entity that can assess homes and perform free efficiency upgrades, reducing energy burdens beyond the 12 months of financial aid.
## **“ I’m very impressed with Duke”**
The brainchild and passion project of former financial and utility consultant Brad Rouse, Energy Savers has undergone a few iterations over its nine years of existence. Its throughline is providing energy-efficiency retrofits, usually in a day’s time, via a team of volunteers guided by a professional.
When everything is running smoothly, that means the group can perform upgrades — such as adding insulation and sealing air leaks — for at least three homes a week, according to Rouse. But in its early years, Energy Savers sometimes struggled to meet that mark.
“The problem is we had a lot of client cancellations,” said Rouse, who today serves as Energy Savers’ executive director. If they were last-minute, the group didn’t always have a backup client ready to take advantage of assembled volunteers and staff. In that case, Rouse said, “we lose the day.”
But now, the organization has almost eliminated that problem. “The Duke Customer Assistance referral is one big reason why,” he said.
That’s because the utility sends so many referrals that it’s easier to find clients who will be ready by the time the Energy Savers team arrives, reducing the likelihood of cancellations. And when a client does fall through, there’s a waiting list ready to be tapped.
The group identifies households in need through multiple channels, including farmers markets, community events, and word of mouth. But its largest source of referrals these days is the Customer Assistance Program, said Steffi Rausch, director of operations.
“We send out a bulk mailing to [potential clients] first and then we try to follow up with phone calls to get them scheduled,” Rausch said.
Boyd, for instance, first got help paying her utility bills through Asheville Buncombe Community Christian Ministry, which accessed one of the federal crisis assistance funds for her. She was soon enrolled in Duke’s $42 bill-credit program and then referred to Energy Savers. “They popped up at my doorstep,” Boyd said.
In the last 11 months, 26% of Energy Savers’ referrals have come from the Duke Customer Assistance Program, according to Rausch. So far, 36 of those referred families have made it through the weatherization process.
“I’m very impressed with Duke at this point,” Rausch said. The utility, which funds the majority of the services provided by Energy Savers, always makes sure the group gets reimbursed, she said. “We’ve never been stuck with the bill.”
To be sure, Duke and advocates for low-income customers are still working out kinks in the bill-credit scheme. One challenge is waning funding for the two federal crisis assistance initiatives that are used to automatically enroll individuals in the Customer Assistance Program. Another hurdle is connecting the dots for recipients, who often don’t realize they’re getting the bill credit or that they’re getting referred to groups like Energy Savers.
Most of all, advocates are mindful that the Customer Assistance Program is in the middle of a three-year pilot phase, and they want to extend it one way or another — as a feature of Duke’s 
Boyd knows as well as advocates that the need for long-lasting energy savings is substantial. She’s now trying to get help for her 93-year-old Aunt Viola, whose electricity bill tops $400 a month.
“It’s only her in the house,“ Boyd said. “She could really use this program.”","Energy efficiency, Energy equity, Utilities, Southeast, North Carolina",north-carolina-families-see-lower-bills-with-new-duke-energy-program-home-weatherization.md,articles_energy-efficiency
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-efficiency/funding-cuts-rhode-island-cost-residents-study,"Cuts to Rhode Island energy-efficiency plan bad for residents, study says",22 September 2025,Sarah Shemkus,"Rhode Island has long led on efficiency. A proposal to slash funding may cost the state $90 million in benefits — while saving each household less than $2 a month.

Funding for Rhode Island’s energy-efficiency programs could be cut by more than $42 million next year in an effort to rein in residents’ soaring power bills. That rollback would deprive the state of more than $90 million in benefits and potentially eliminate hundreds of jobs while creating only modest up-front savings, a 
Rhode Island Energy, the utility that administers the state’s energy-efficiency offerings, 18% compared to last year and more than 30% compared to the budget originally projected in the nonbinding three-year plan introduced in 2023. If approved, the cuts will save the average household $1.87 per month, according to Rhode Island Energy.
The result of these changes, according to climate action nonprofit Acadia Center, would be more expensive electricity and more exposure to volatile natural gas prices in the long run.
“Energy efficiency is a tool for suppressing supply costs, for suppressing infrastructure costs in the long-term,” said Emily Koo, Acadia Center’s program director for Rhode Island and one of the authors of the group’s analysis. “I am not seeing our leaders think beyond the immediate.”
Rhode Island has traditionally been a leader in energy-efficiency programming. Over the past 15 years, the state has repeatedly placed among the top 10 states in the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy’s annual 2009, the state has spent more than $2 billion on efficiency incentives and services, yielding more than $6 billion in environmental and social benefits.
Now, however, the dynamics of energy markets are creating new obstacles. Nationwide, electricity costs have gone up at twice the rate of inflation over the past year, and gas prices have increased by more than four times the inflation rate. Rhode Island, like other New England states, has the added difficulty of already having some of the highest electricity rates in the country. Add in cold Northeastern winters, and the state is girding for an expensive season ahead.
As in neighboring states, regulators, elected officials, and utilities in Rhode Island are scrambling for ways to provide some relief for residents and businesses. These efforts have increasingly looked to the bill fees that fund renewable energy incentives and energy-efficiency programs as possible targets for quick, if small, bill reductions. In Maine, for example, leaders from both sides of the aisle have sought to [lower incentives](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/solar-is-not-the-culprit-for-maines-high-utility-bills-despite-claims) for customers and [community solar developments](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/maine-bill-threaten-community-solar) that send power back to the grid, and in Massachusetts, utility regulators ordered energy-efficiency administrators to 5 billion three-year budget.
Now, Rhode Island Energy is proposing rollbacks of its own, saying that its latest plan prioritizes customer affordability. The company has the support of the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, which points to the growth in accounts with overdue utility bills to bolster its argument that the changes will provide needed relief to consumers.
“There is simply a financial limit as to how much cost the ratepayers can bear,” the department wrote in its 
Advocates, however, say the approach is short-sighted.
“This is weaker. It’s a retreat,” said Larry Chretien, executive director of the nonprofit Green Energy Consumers Alliance, which opposes the proposed cuts. “It just feeds into the narrative — that we don’t accept — that ratepayers aren’t seeing benefits from energy efficiency.”
Rhode Island’s energy-efficiency offerings include home energy assessments, weatherization services, rebates on energy-saving appliances and heating and cooling systems, and contractor training. Residents and businesses that take advantage of these programs generally save money by reducing their energy use.
The programs also create savings for the average consumer, whether or not they participate. Because the improvements slow energy consumption, they allow utilities to build less pricey infrastructure, the cost of which is passed on to customers. Efficiency measures can also lower peak demand, reducing the need to buy costlier, dirtier power from peaker plants. In Rhode Island, efficiency programs lowered electricity use 5% between 2005 and 2024; without these interventions, use would have increased 15%, according to an annual state report.
Advocates, therefore, argue that Rhode Island Energy’s plan to shrink energy-efficiency spending won’t actually result in more affordable power in the long run.
“You spend money on energy efficiency or you’re going to spend even more money on power supply,” said Forest Bradley-Wright, state and utility director for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
Acadia Center’s analysis also finds that more than 800 jobs in the energy-efficiency sector could be at risk if the cuts are adopted.
The draft plan has been through multiple iterations; the most recent version was released on Sept. 5. The state energy-efficiency council is expected to vote on the proposal at its Sept. 25 meeting. The plan will then go to utility regulators for final approval.
Advocates say they intend to keep pushing for high funding levels until the process concludes. 
“The benefits we’re experiencing today are already translating into lower bills,” Bradley-Wright said. “There’s a track record of success, but let’s not take it for granted.”","Energy efficiency, Utilities, Northeast, Rhode Island",funding-cuts-rhode-island-cost-residents-study.md,articles_energy-efficiency
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-efficiency/chicago-mecro-light-dark-streets,Chicago program to light up dark streets is gateway to energy efficiency,5 June 2025,Audrey Henderson,"MECRO outfits porches with LED lights that automatically turn on at dusk, helping residents feel safer — and showing them how to start lowering their energy bills.

The 79th Street corridor is one of the busiest thoroughfares on Chicago’s Southeast Side. But many of its adjacent side streets are poorly lit at night, posing hazards ranging from inconvenient to dangerous.
For instance, obscured house numbers can confuse both delivery drivers and emergency responders. And 
“For those people who are going to work in the winter at five o’clock in the morning and it’s pitch black out there, yeah, they’re scared. They’re walking down the middle of the street,” said Sharon “Sy” Lewis, founder and executive director of Meadows Eastside Community Resource Organization, commonly referred to by its acronym of 
But block by block, things are changing, in no small part due to MECRO in collaboration with the energy-efficiency program of Chicago utility ComEd. The initiative aims to solve the problem of dark streets by outfitting the front and back of homes with energy-efficient lights that automatically turn on at night and off during the day.
Light Up the Night was LED light bulbs for up to 300 residences.
The program had to pause during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, but eventually, Light Up the Night was able to achieve that goal and then some. Lewis said it has served more than 500 homes so far, and she is pursuing funding to expand.
MECRO staff or volunteers install the bulbs into existing outlets at no charge to residents. Lewis said this proactive approach yields better results than just distributing packages of light bulbs and other energy-saving devices that may or may not get used.

For Lewis, the installation process provides an opening to talk to residents about other energy-efficient measures, like weatherization or purchasing [new appliances](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/new-appliances-can-help-keep-people-in-their-homes-but-upfront-costs-are-a-big-obstacle). The upgrades, often eligible for rebates to offset the cost, can dramatically reduce utility bills. This is particularly impactful in communities like those surrounding the 79th Street corridor, in which many residents spend a big portion of their income on energy bills, largely due to predominantly older and often poorly insulated housing stock.
“Light Up the Night is not just a gateway to safety, it’s a gateway to energy savings. And it starts with the little things. And because we installed it, instead of sending them an ‘energy box,’ then we know that it’s working. When you drive down that street, you know that it’s working, you see that impact,” Lewis said.
## Block clubs and trusted advocates win over hesitant residents
A minimum of 75% participation is required per block, and each homeowner or renter must provide consent before installation can begin, Lewis said.
“If the average block has 36 homes on it, if we get 15 on each side, at minimum, we have really created an impact for the block,” Lewis said. “So now you have the whole community lighting up at once [at dusk], and then they all go off in the morning.”
A legacy of segregation and disinvestment has left residents of predominantly Black communities like the Southeast Side with a strong distrust of outsiders. As a lifelong resident and visible activist, Lewis has an advantage when it comes to engaging with residents, but obtaining initial buy-in around South Shore was still a challenge.
“Getting people to sign up, that was a problem because we can’t not have data on where we are leaving the lights. … [But] people didn’t want to provide their information,” Lewis said.

To get the program up and running, Lewis worked with neighborhood block clubs to overcome apprehension and to identify particular streets in the South Shore community that would benefit the most from the new lights. She also worked with other community organizations, especially those focused on violence prevention.
It was easier to start up the program in Austin, a neighborhood on the city’s West Side, where, also in 2019, Lewis collaborated with Steve Robinson, executive director of the Northwest Austin Council, with whom she had worked previously on a number of initiatives. Chicago police officers assigned to that community were also enthusiastic about the program, and helped Lewis identify blocks where adding lights would be especially impactful, she said.
“[Robinson] invited me over there. It was a whole change. It was a sea change. It was amazing. [The police] were excited about it. They were looking forward to the change we were doing,” Lewis said.
## Quick implementation, enduring benefits
Wherever it has been implemented, this small-scale program has had an outsized positive impact, Lewis said. Additional lighting on front porches and entryways also enhances safety for visitors to the community, including service providers like mail carriers, delivery people, and rideshare drivers. Likewise, floodlights installed at the rear of a home or apartment building add to the ambient lighting in often dark alleyways, which results in fewer garage break-ins and instances of illegal dumping of garbage, Lewis said.
MECRO does much more than install lights. The organization also helps guide new and existing small business owners, conducting educational seminars and offering technical assistance. And it provides residents with referrals for energy-efficiency improvements and other sustainability-related resources they might not otherwise know about.
But Light Up the Night remains part of the organization’s core mission.
While illuminating areas that used to be dark is the program’s first objective, once the new bulbs have replaced older, less-efficient lights, the lower utility bills can be eye-opening for residents.
When people see those savings, “they start thinking, ‘Well, what if I get all energy-efficiency light bulbs? Hmm. Okay, now my bill has gone really down. What if I do the weatherization program? Now my bill is really down,’” Lewis said.","Energy efficiency, Midwest, Illinois",chicago-mecro-light-dark-streets.md,articles_energy-efficiency

Now a new state energy-efficiency plan aims to accelerate the trend to cut emissions and control power prices.

Maine’s 
The plan, set to go into effect in July, is heavily focused on getting electric heat pumps in as many homes as possible. It comes as other states [debate rolling back](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/connecticut-electric-bills-nuclear-solar) efficiency programs funded by utility customers [as a short-term fix](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/new-england-cuts-clean-energy-bills) to rising energy prices. Maine’s strategy takes the opposite approach: It leverages investments in efficiency and electrification to lower rates for everyone.
“This is bucking the trend,” said Michael Stoddard, executive director of Efficiency Maine Trust, the agency that administers the state’s energy-efficiency plans. “This is our pathway to managing electricity prices while also transitioning the consumers of our state to the highest-efficiency, lowest-polluting equipment that is available.”
Maine has been an aggressive adopter of home heat pumps in recent years. In 2019, the state set the goal of deploying 100,000 heat pumps by 2025, a target it blew by two years ahead of schedule. The state now aims to get another 175,000 heat pumps up and running by 2027. Maine is also a member of a five-state coalition that is collaborating to boost heat pump adoption, lower prices, and train installers throughout New England.
The state’s new energy-efficiency plan is geared toward continuing this progress. It is centered largely on the idea of “beneficial electrification,” a somewhat jargony term that refers to switching from fossil fuels to electricity wherever the move would save money and cut emissions. There are plenty of opportunities to make that swap in Maine, where roughly half of households keep warm with heating oil, which can be pricey and inefficient.
Over the next three years, the incentives in the plan are forecast to support 38,000 new whole-home residential heat pump systems — including 6,500 in low-income households — and weatherization for 9,900 houses. A low-income household can get rebates of up to $9,000 for heat pump installations, and homes at high income levels qualify for up to $3,000. The incentives do not offer any money for residential fossil-fuel-burning equipment.
This strategy should decrease annual heating costs by more than $1,000 each for homes that switch to heat pumps from oil, propane, or electric baseboard heat, but it is also expected to lower electricity prices across the board, Stoddard said. Efficiency Maine Trust estimates the plan will suppress electricity rates by more than $490 million over the long term.
How? Utilities have certain fixed costs, such as maintaining power lines. To pay for them — and this is a bit of a simplification — they essentially divide the expense by the amount of power they expect customers to use in a year, and add that number to the rate they charge per kilowatt-hour. When more heat pumps come online, power demand goes up, so the fixed costs are spread out over more kilowatt-hours, lowering bills for the average consumer.
Accomplishing that effect depends on finding ways to make sure much of the added demand occurs during off-peak hours, when there is plenty of room for more power to flow along the lines without building out more infrastructure and thus increasing the utilities’ fixed costs. To achieve this timing, Maine’s plan includes demand-response programs that pay consumers for using less energy at peak times, an incentive for low-income residents to buy electric vehicles with chargers that can be set to work at off-peak times, and other measures.
“We’ve already invested a lot of money in the grid, and yet it sits largely unused for many hours of the day,” Stoddard said. “If we can find ways to manage consumption so that it is occurring during off-peak periods, then it will maximize the use of the grid infrastructure and spread the fixed costs of the utility across many more kilowatt-hours.”
Maine’s plan also includes an innovative program that calls for Efficiency Maine Trust to negotiate with retailers and distributors for discounted prices on electric water heaters and for agreements to keep the equipment in stock. The strategy is particularly effective at getting people to switch from fossil-fuel water heaters in moments when their old equipment has failed and they are searching for an affordable, easily available replacement, said Erin Cosgrove, director of policy and programs for the nonprofit Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships.
“This program is unique for the Northeast,” she said.
More states have prioritized electrification in their efficiency programs in recent years, said Mark Kresowik, senior policy director for the research group American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. Massachusetts, for example, phased out its incentives for oil and gas equipment last year, and Washington, D.C., has also eliminated rebates for fossil-fuel-powered systems and appliances.
“What a lot of programs across the country are doing is recognizing that providing incentives for fossil-fuel-based systems doesn’t achieve their goals,” he said. “Most of the leading states are prioritizing efficient electric appliances like heat pumps going forward.”
Energy-efficiency programs have traditionally centered the big-picture goal of helping consumers lower their energy use to save money and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, whether that energy comes from an oil-delivery truck, a natural gas pipe, or over power lines.
Amid rising concern about climate change, however, more states have looked for ways to amplify the emissions impact of their programs. The solution has been to limit or eliminate incentives for fossil-fuel equipment and lean into electrification, which can often save consumers money and almost always reduce the emissions associated with heating and cooling their homes.
“When you use those additional metrics, you realize some of those old measures don’t make sense anymore,” Kresowik said.","Energy efficiency, Electrification, Emissions reduction, Heat pumps, Northeast, Maine",maine-heat-pump-electric-costs.md,articles_energy-efficiency
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/land-use/trump-interior-order-fossil-fuel-misinformation,Trump admin’s new anti-renewables rule rooted in fossil-fuel misinformation,25 August 2025,Kathiann M. Kowalski,"The Interior Department’s directive casts solar and wind energy as bad for the environment, without weighing costs of oil, coal, and gas, critics say. 
For years, anti-renewable-energy advocates have opposed solar and wind projects on the grounds that they take up too much land. Now those talking points, popularized by groups linked to the fossil-fuel industry, have made their way into a sweeping new directive from the Trump administration.
On Aug. 1, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum mandated that federal leasing decisions factor in “capacity density” for solar and wind projects.
His “capacity density” as the amount of electricity a proposed facility is expected to produce, as a share of the maximum “nameplate” amount, divided by the site’s total acres. An appendix to the order shows that nuclear and combined-cycle gas plants rank highest on this measure, while renewables come in last.
The Interior Department will now have to consider the density measure in environmental reviews. With that in mind, the order questions whether the law allows any federal land use for wind and solar projects, “given these projects’ encumbrance on other land uses, as well as their disproportionate land use.”
Only a small portion of solar and wind projects are located on areas owned and managed by the U.S. government, but there is vast potential for development. A 1,300 gigawatts of solar and 60 GW of onshore wind could be cost-effectively built on public lands, and that significant deployment in those spaces would be needed to meet grid-decarbonization goals.
It’s unclear whether the order might also block some projects on private property if they require reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act.
The directive is yet another example of the Trump administration’s push to slow the development of solar and wind, which together with batteries will account for more than 90% of 
“This is the latest sign that the Trump administration is really just relying on political talking points to push back on renewable energy that have little or no basis in fact,” said Dave Anderson, policy and communications manager for the Energy and Policy Institute, a watchdog group that focuses on the fossil-fuel and utility industries.
## **The density debate**
Before “capacity density” became a factor in federal leasing decisions, anti-renewable-energy groups were using the argument to build local opposition to utility-scale clean-power projects across the country.
The battle over a [now-approved solar project](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/ohio-frasier-approved-local-opposition) in central Ohio provides a case in point.
In November 2023, a group called Knox Smart Development held a town-hall meeting to [stoke opposition](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/anonymously-funded-group-stokes-local-opposition-to-ohio-solar-project) to the proposed 120-megawatt Frasier agrivoltaics project.
Canary Media ([then the Energy News Network](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/canary-media/press-release-canary-media-and-enn-merge-with-sights-on-expansion-and-nonprofit-sustainability)) confirmed last year that one of the [main funders of the group](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/connections-confirmed-between-grassroots-ohio-solar-opposition-and-dark-money-natural-gas-group) was Tom Rastin, former vice president of Ariel Corp., which makes compressors for the oil and gas industry. Rastin and his wife, Karen Buchwald Wright, who is the company’s board chair, also play large roles in 
Steve Goreham, a policy advisor to conservative think tank 2023 event.
In addition to denying that climate change requires a shift away from fossil fuels, Goreham told people at the Knox County meeting that solar farms require much more land than nuclear, gas, and coal-fired power plants. He also focused on “power density” in a 2023 opinion piece for the conservative-leaning “environmental devastation” will result from policies that aim to accomplish net-zero carbon emissions.

“Everybody needs to come to this debate with a full picture of who they’re talking to and why they’re saying what they’re saying,” said Ray Locker, executive director for the Checks and Balances Project. Companies in the fossil-fuel industry “have a vested interest in preserving their business,” so when they present renewable energy “as somehow dirty, then that furthers their interest.”
This month’s Interior Department order is not the only recent federal attack on clean energy based on the land-use argument. Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins [longstanding Rural Energy for America Program](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/usda-solar-rural-grants-uncertainty) would no longer fund large solar projects on “prime farmland,” a major shift for a program whose main use case has been [helping farmers](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/food-and-farms/theres-a-push-underway-to-help-more-us-farms-save-big-with-clean-energy) install solar energy.
## **“ An absurd metric”**
Burgum’s order to the Department of the Interior is “really implementing an ideological agenda,” said Brendan Pierpont, director of electricity modeling at think tank Energy Innovation. In his view, the mandate’s definition of capacity density is an “absurd metric,” with multiple flaws.
Among other things, the capacity-density measurement does not capture the full picture of what it takes to produce electricity from a fossil-fueled or nuclear power plant.
The metric focuses only on the step where electricity is generated. A full life-cycle analysis would consider all stages for producing equipment, obtaining and transporting fuel, and dealing with waste. The Interior Department’s recent order is “entirely designed to make these [renewable] resources they don’t like look bad,” Pierpont said.
The definition of capacity density also fails to account for the fact that renewable projects can coexist with other activities, such as livestock grazing or farming certain crops, noted Matthias Fripp, global policy research director at Energy Innovation.
Additionally, land used for solar or wind energy can produce electricity for decades, he said, unlike fossil fuels, where the industry must “keep finding new land” for resource extraction. Researchers made a similar point in PLOS One, which found the land requirements for coal-fired electricity could equal or exceed those for renewable energy within two to 31 years.
Anderson at the Energy and Policy Institute called the rationale for the Interior Department’s order “a red-herring argument to focus on just one of the impacts of different energy sources.”
Nowhere does the order address environmental and health concerns about mining for coal or uranium, drilling for oil and gas, or transporting and burning those fuels. Waste disposal, particularly for coal and nuclear plants, also poses a challenge.
Renewables “are obviously leaps and bounds ahead of fossil fuels in terms of their net benefits,” Anderson said.","Land use, Fossil fuels, Policy regulation",trump-interior-order-fossil-fuel-misinformation.md,articles_land-use

In late spring, the Department of Energy ordered two [aging and costly fossil-fueled power plants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/coal-grid-reliability-trump) that were on the verge of shutting down to stay open. The agency claimed that the moves were necessary to prevent the power grid from collapsing — and that it has the [power to force the plants to stay open](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/trump-coal-power-order-reliability) even if the utilities, state regulators, and grid operators managing them say that no such emergency exists.
More of these orders could be on the way. The “Beautiful Clean Coal” 
But state regulators, regional grid operators, environmental groups, and consumer groups are pushing back on the notion that the grids in question even need these interventions — and are challenging the legality of the DOE’s stay-open orders.
Last month, DOE, demanding that it reconsider emergency orders to force the [J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/a-michigan-coal-plant-was-about-to-close-trump-ordered-it-to-stay-open) and the 
The DOE claimed that the threat of large-scale grid blackouts forced its hand. But state utility regulators, environmental groups, consumer advocates, and energy experts say that careful analysis from the plant’s owners, state regulators, regional grid operators, and grid reliability experts had determined both plants could be safely closed.
These groups argue that clean energy, not fossil fuels, are the true solution to the country’s grid challenges — even if the [“big, beautiful” bill signed by Trump last week](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/trump-big-beautiful-bill-industry-impacts) will make those resources more expensive to build. Some of the environmental organizations challenging DOE’s orders have pledged to take their case to federal court if necessary.
“We need to get more electrons on the grid. We need those to be clean, reliable, and affordable,” said Robert Routh, Pennsylvania climate and energy policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the groups demanding that DOE reconsider its orders. Keeping J.H. Campbell and Eddystone open “results in the exact opposite. It’s costly, harmful, unnecessary, and unlawful.”
## **Taking on the DOE’s grid emergency claims**
The groups challenging the DOE’s J.H. Campbell and Eddystone stay-open orders point out that the agency is using a power originally designed to protect the grid against unanticipated emergencies, including during wartime, but without proving that such an emergency is underway.
“This authority that the Department of Energy is acting under — Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act — is a very tailored emergency authority,” said Caroline Reiser, NRDC senior attorney for climate and energy. “Congress intentionally wrote it only to be usable in specific, narrow, short-term emergencies. This is not that.”
For decades, the DOE has used its 
But the DOE’s orders for Eddystone and J.H. Campbell were not spurred by requests from state regulators or regional grid operators. In fact, the orders caught those parties by surprise.
They also came mere days before the plants were set to close down and after years of effort to ensure their closure wouldn’t threaten grid reliability. J.H. Campbell was scheduled to close in May under a plan that has [been in the works since 2021](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/michigans-consumers-energy-pushes-to-replace-all-coal-plants-with-natural-gas-by-2025) as part of a broader MISO), the entity that manages grid reliability across Michigan and 14 other states.
“The plant is really old, unreliable, extremely polluting, and extremely expensive,” Reiser said. “Nobody is saying that this plant is needed or is going to be beneficial for any reliability purposes.”
To justify its stay-open order, the NERC), a nonprofit regulatory authority that includes utilities and grid operators in the U.S. and Canada. NERC found MISO is at higher risk of summertime reliability problems than other U.S. grid regions, but environmental groups argue in DOE has “misrepresented the reports on which it relies,” and that Consumers Energy, Michigan regulators, and MISO have collectively shown closing the plant won’t endanger grid reliability.
Eddystone, which had operated only infrequently over the past few years, also went through a rigorous process with mid-Atlantic grid operator PJM Interconnection to DOE’s reason for keeping that plant open is based on a 
As long as the DOE continues to take the position that it can issue emergency stay-open orders to any power plant it decides to, these established methods for managing plant closures and fairly allocating costs will be thrown into disarray, she said.
“We have a system of competitive energy markets in the United States that is successful in keeping the lights on and maintaining reliability the vast, vast majority of the time,” Reiser said. “The Department of Energy stepping in and using a command-and-control system interferes with those markets.”
Utility regulators from MISO states including Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin made a similar argument in their rehearing request to the DOE. “This expansive use of emergency powers sets a troubling precedent, enabling intervention in routine, state-approved planning decisions without an actual crisis,” they wrote. “Such preemptive action risks undermining the credibility of future emergency orders, distorting market signals, and eroding the statutory balance between federal and state authority.”
Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, highlighted the years of work that went into enabling the J.H. Campbell plant to safely close, and the 
“For DOE to substitute its judgment of what’s necessary for the work that’s done by the states and the regional grid operators is something that a large number of states of different political makeups find most troubling,” he said.
## **A double whammy on costs for utility customers**
Forcing aging and expensive power plants to stay open past their long-planned retirement dates also threatens to drive up costs for utility customers at a time when energy prices are already set to rise due to GOP policies. Think tank Energy Innovation forecasts the megabill passed by congressional Republicans last week will lead to a 2030, as cuts to tax credits stifle investment in solar, wind, and battery projects and force power grids to rely on older, costlier resources.
This week’s DOE report “is another attempt to push the false narrative that our country’s energy future depends upon decades-old coal- and gas-plants, rather than clean renewables,” Greg Wannier, senior attorney at the Sierra Club, said in a statement. “The only energy crisis faced by the American public is the catastrophic increase in costs that the Trump Administration is forcing on the country’s ratepayers.”
Coal has fallen from nearly half U.S. generation capacity in 2011 to [just 15% last year](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/wind-and-solar-overtook-coal-on-the-us-grid-in-2024), and more than 120 U.S. coal plants are [expected to close](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-states-more-power-wind-solar-coal) over the next five years. Coal industry groups and many Republicans blame state climate regulations for that trend. But energy experts agree that the primary driver is that coal plants are unable to provide power at prices that can compete with fossil gas or renewables.
Aging power plants like J.H. Campbell and Eddystone, which were built roughly 60 years ago, are among the most expensive to run — one of the main reasons why those two were both slated for retirement. Forcing them to restart and stay open for three months on the eve of their planned closures 
Utility customers in the Midwest and mid-Atlantic grid regions those plants are connected to will now bear all of those costs. While the total dollar amount has yet to be calculated, it could run into the tens of millions for each plant, or 
Under its Section 202(c) authority, the DOE doesn’t have to deal with the costs its emergency orders incur, said Clara Summers, campaign manager for the Citizens Utility Board, an Illinois-based utility customer watchdog group. Instead, it gets to delegate the method of recovering those expenses to grid operators and regulators.
But the DOE has failed to show that keeping those plants open will benefit customers, which puts those entities in a bind.
“There is a standard in ratemaking that costs should be prudently incurred,” Summers said. “Since these costs are manufactured emergencies and are not prudently incurred, they are not just and reasonable.”
That’s the argument that environmental and consumer watchdog groups have made in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency tasked with overseeing the U.S. power grid. The groups have asked FERC to reject plans to recover costs from DOE’s DOE has failed to show how keeping the plants open will benefit consumers.
“What’s especially frustrating about that is that we already have capacity markets that are there to make sure that we have enough electricity, and consumers already pay for that,” Summers said. Those costs to utility customers are [rising dramatically in PJM](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/prices-just-spiked-in-the-biggest-us-power-market-blame-the-grid-backlog), where years of backlogged interconnection processes have [prevented new solar, wind, and battery projects](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/how-pjm-can-get-the-power-that-it-needs-and-fast) from coming online to help replace power plants being closed. 
The whole function of those markets is to ensure we have enough electricity — and those markets procure enough electricity,” Summers said. “This is something PJM agrees with, that MISO agrees with, that NERC agrees with.”
The DOE has 30 days from when the rehearing requests were filed to open a review of its stay-open orders, Reiser said. If the DOE doesn’t issue an order within that time, “it basically opens up the option for us to go to court.”
The DOE has never used its Section 202(c) authority in this way before, which means it has never been challenged in court on the issues at hand, Reiser said.
But “the fact that there are related executive orders kind of directing the Department of Energy to do these things doesn’t change the basic standards of how our legal system works and how courts interpret statutes,” she added. “No matter the reasoning, they still have to comply with the law.”","Fossil fuels, Policy regulation",trump-coal-plant-order-challenges.md,articles_fossil-fuels

Coal, the most polluting and carbon-intensive source of electricity, has fallen from nearly half the country’s generating capacity in 2011 [to just 15% last year](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/wind-and-solar-overtook-coal-on-the-us-grid-in-2024). Cheaper fossil gas and even cheaper clean energy and batteries have decimated its economics. Over 120 U.S. coal plants are [slated to shutter](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-states-more-power-wind-solar-coal) over the next five years.
“The only way to revive coal is to do two things,” Slocum said. “One is to force ratepayers to pay for it. That means electricity’s going to get more expensive to bail out what’s probably, at this point, one of the most expensive forms of energy out there. The other thing they need to do is pollute clean water, foul the air, and contribute to the climate crisis — because that’s what coal plants do.”
## **The reliability regime that Trump’s executive order would disrupt**
States regulate utilities and thus have primary authority over the nation’s electricity generation. Even within competitive energy markets, where many power plants are owned and operated by companies that aren’t regulated utilities, states retain significant say over which plants are built, kept open, or closed down.
But the federal government also has significant powers, as laid out in the 
Two entities are primarily responsible for grid reliability under current law: the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, an agency with commissioners appointed by the president but traditionally independent from political interference, and the North American Electric Reliability Corp., a nonprofit regulatory authority that includes utilities and grid operators in the U.S. and Canada.
FERC and NERC commonly issue recommendations or mandates on grid reliability. NERC [bottlenecks in interconnecting new generation](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/lots-of-demand-too-little-grid-the-us-power-sector-in-2024), [lack of investments in expanding transmission grids](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/lots-of-demand-too-little-grid-the-us-power-sector-in-2024), and [expectations of rapid growth in electricity use](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/data-centers-are-driving-us-power-demand-to-hard-to-reach-heights). Republican lawmakers and a number of utilities have cited these conditions to call for keeping coal plants open past planned closure dates.
The mechanisms by which the federal government ensures the reliability of the grid are set out in Section 215 of the Federal Power Act, said Sanjay Narayan, a managing attorney at Sierra Club’s environmental law program. Over the decades, he said, FERC, NERC, regional grid operators, and state-regulated utilities have established “elaborate regulatory processes that ensure there are adequate reserve margins.” Reserve margins are the generation capacity needed to maintain grid reliability during peaks in power demand, major grid failures, extreme weather events, and other emergencies.
But another section of the Federal Power Act — Section 202(c) — gives the federal government some extraordinary powers. It allows the energy secretary to order certain power plants to keep running during emergencies, and to waive federal and state environmental rules to allow them to do so without threat of lawsuit or regulatory punishment.
“when unexpected events, mostly weather-related, threaten short-term outages,” Narayan said.
In a few instances, DOE has ordered a power plant to stay open until new power lines can be built to prevent grid-reliability threats, he said. Utilities and grid operators have similar authority, which they have [used to keep plants running for years](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/zombie-coal-plants-could-threaten-the-us-energy-transition) past their planned retirement dates.
But Section 202(c) authority has never been used “to force ratepayers to subsidize politically favored parties who can’t compete in the market,” Narayan said. “And nothing about long-term reserve margins fits within the statutory or common understanding of an emergency, which is what Section 202 is meant to address.”
## **Giving DOE total control over which power plants stay or go **
Tuesday’s “reliability and security” executive order seeks to extend those emergency powers indefinitely, Slocum said. It gives DOE sole jurisdiction to determine whether any power plant in the country can close or whether it must stay open until DOE says it isn’t needed anymore.
First, the executive order tasks DOE with creating a “uniform methodology” for analyzing “current and anticipated reserve margins” for all transmission grids regulated by FERC. Then it orders DOE to identify regions where reserve margins are or could be “below acceptable thresholds” — essentially, telling DOE to recreate the reliability risk-assessment work that FERC, NERC, regional grid operators, and state regulators and utilities already do, but with no outside input or oversight.
Finally, it orders DOE to establish a “protocol to identify which generation resources within a region are critical to system reliability,” and use “all mechanisms available under applicable law, including section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act,” to prevent any “critical” generator larger than 50 megawatts “from leaving the bulk-power system” — or changing the type of fuel it uses — if that would violate DOE’s reserve margin methodology.
In simple terms, instead of FERC, NERC, grid operators, utilities, state regulators, and policymakers working together under their established spheres of authority to independently study and manage grid-reliability needs, the energy secretary would “unilaterally set his own reserve margins,” Slocum said.
Then, “if things fall below his arbitrarily set reserve margin, he can declare a Section 202 emergency” to prevent power plant closures in the relevant grid region, he said. Because power plant owners must be compensated for operating those facilities, this equates to forcing utilities or energy markets to pay them to stay open, whether or not their electricity is cost-competitive.
The executive order outlines no role for any other federal agency or other stakeholder in this new process. 
“The Secretary of Energy can set whatever reserve he wants,” Slocum said. “It’s not in consultation with [grid operators], or FERC, or NERC. It’s a unilateral, arbitrary standard.”
Many utilities AI data centers. Representatives of U.S. regional grid operators told members of Congress in a hearing last month that retaining existing generation is their top reliability priority.
But giving one agency complete control over those decisions “could undermine years of industry progress in determining the reliability value of different power-generating resources,” said Devin Hartman, director of the energy and environmental policy team at free market–oriented think tank R Street Institute. “Ensuring economical power plants are not forced to close by the government should be a reform priority. But this intervention risks disrupting markets and deterring new supply.”
Meanwhile, clean-energy backers and climate advocates argue that the nation’s biggest grid-reliability problem isn’t coal plants closing. Instead, they blame the inadequate grid buildout and clogged interconnection queues that have prevented developers from bringing online [hundreds of gigawatts of solar, wind, and battery projects](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/the-growing-clean-energy-backlog-in-five-charts) — all cheaper than coal and often fossil gas, too.
## **A political takeover of the U.S. power grid**
Energy law and policy experts were quick to point out how radically Tuesday’s executive order would undermine decades of regulatory and legal precedent.
“This EO imagines that a 90-year old law about power sector ‘emergencies’ empowers the Dept of Energy to subsidize any power plant in the country,” Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard Law School’s Electricity Law Initiative, wrote in a 
Mike O’Boyle, acting policy team director at think tank Energy Innovation, told Canary Media that the executive order “threatens the very heart and mission of both competitive wholesale markets as well as state planning and procurement processes. In that way, it amounts to a statement from the federal government that federal and state energy regulators are unable to do their jobs,” he said.
It’s also poor practice in terms of solving grid-reliability challenges, O’Boyle said. 
“If the Department of Energy decides to do this exercise honestly,” it will find that “reliability risk is highly concentrated in only a few hours of the year,” he said, “and that there are in many cases more and cheaper resources than coal plants that are available to meet that need.”
But Slocum said he fears Wright, the founder and former CEO of fracking giant Liberty Energy, will use unilateral DOE authority to structure a methodology that overvalues fossil fuels’ contribution to grid reliability. Wright has consistently and frequently claimed fossil fuels are superior to renewables, at times citing demonstrably false information.
For example, “everywhere wind and solar penetration have increased significantly, prices on the grid went up and stability of the grid went down.” That statement contradicts data that shows renewable energy penetration is [not correlated to higher electricity prices](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/dont-blame-clean-energy-for-rising-electric-bills) and that major wintertime U.S. grid-reliability failures in Texas in 2021 and across the Southeast in 2022 were linked to [failures of fossil-fueled power plants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/natural-gas-is-the-pillar-of-the-us-electric-grid-its-also-unreliable).
Giving one presidential appointee with a clear bias toward fossil fuels sole authority over every proposed power plant closure in the country exposes core reliability decisions to political considerations, Slocum added. That stands in stark contrast to the role played by FERC, whose commissioners are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, but who have traditionally made decisions independently.
That distinction is important, he said: Independent FERC commissioners already rejected the first Trump administration’s attempt to use federal power to force coal plants to stay open.
In 2017, then–Energy Secretary Rick Perry attempted to implement federal rules that would have declared coal and nuclear plants vital to grid reliability. That plan was unanimously rejected by five FERC commissioners — four of whom were appointed by Trump — on the grounds the 
Officials serving in the first Trump administration also undermined the idea that DOE’s Section 202(c) emergency authority is appropriate for ordering power plants to remain open for long periods of time outside of pressing grid emergencies. After media reports surfaced of the leaked memo laying out a plan to do so, Assistant DOE Secretary Bruce Walker stated the department 
That statement is in keeping with the law, said Pavel Molchanov, investment strategy analyst at financial services firm Raymond James.
“As a matter of statutory language, Section 202(c) is for emergency situations in the power market,” he said. “It is emphatically _not_ intended to be used for keeping non-economic power plants in operation.”
Any orders to force coal plants open that would otherwise be preparing to close down would almost certainly end up driving up energy costs.
Midwestern utilities are already [pushing billions of dollars of unnecessary costs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/indianas-dependence-on-coal-is-costing-ratepayers-millions-and-holding-back-clean-energy-growth) onto their customers by running coal plants at times when cheaper power could supplant the energy they’re delivering to the grid. A 2023 Energy Innovation report found that 99% of U.S. coal plants [could be replaced with solar, wind, and batteries](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/clean-energy-is-cheaper-than-coal-across-the-whole-us-study-finds) at a net cost savings to utility customers.
“If they pull the ‘must-generate’ lever, they’re simply going to be taking market share from cheaper gas and renewables,” Narayan said. That’s the equivalent of “taking money — the additional cost of running more expensive sources — out of ratepayers’ pockets.”
John Moore, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, also highlighted the climate, environmental, and health harms caused by burning coal and disposing of the toxic ash left behind. A 2023 study from the National Institutes of Health found that 460,000 deaths between 1999 and 2020.
“The patient is beyond recovery at this point,” Moore said of the coal industry. “Any attempts to focus on coal specifically will just harm and kill more people and cause more environmental damage.

But President Donald Trump is trying to put a stop to coal’s demise. On his first day in office, Trump declared a national energy emergency that experts have called baseless and which is now being challenged by 15 states in court. The “emergency” is also belied by Trump’s [efforts](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-admin-halts-construction-of-nearly-finished-offshore-wind-farm) to [obstruct](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/trump-blocks-reap-funding-farmers) [clean energy](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/trump-admin-tightens-vise-on-wind-and-solar-with-new-tax-rules), which for years has accounted for [over 90% of new electricity](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-96-percent-of-new-us-power-capacity-was-carbon-free-in-2024) added to the grid.
Trump has since built on that edict by availing himself of emergency powers to force fossil-fuel plants to stay online past their scheduled retirement.
In May, the Trump administration issued 90-day [stay-open orders](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/a-michigan-coal-plant-was-about-to-close-trump-ordered-it-to-stay-open) for two facilities set to close days later: the J.H.

Families and businesses will pay the price: The first three months of continuing to operate J.H.

Just about everyone says he’s wrong.

Building a new natural gas pipeline from Pennsylvania to New York would not make electricity in New England more affordable or reliable, experts say, despite the Trump administration’s push to revive a project that stalled out years ago.
Environmental advocates object to the construction of more gas infrastructure at a time when much of New England is trying to wean itself off fossil fuels, but there are economic concerns as well. Industry insiders say the proposed Constitution pipeline would do little to get more gas to New England power plants and could raise costs for both generators and consumers.
“There certainly is an increasing demand for energy, particularly electricity,” said Jeremy McDiarmid, managing director and general counsel for national industry group Advanced Energy United. “But the narrative that natural gas is going to somehow create a big downward pressure on electricity and energy bills is just not proven out in the data.”
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin breathed new life into that narrative in a Boston Globe op-ed 125-mile project that would transport gas from the fracking fields of Pennsylvania into New York, on the grounds that it would save New Englanders money.
It’s the latest in the EPA’s shift away from its historical mission of safeguarding environmental and public health and toward slashing regulations with the goal of “unleashing American energy” and lowering costs for residents. Since President Donald Trump took office, the agency has announced plans to [end the $7 billion Solar for All](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/trump-looks-to-kill-solar-for-all-just-as-it-starts-to-deliver) program that funds solar projects for low-income households, [eliminate the Energy Star label](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-efficiency/trump-energy-star-liheap-building) for energy-efficient appliances, and [strip itself of authority](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/epa-moves-to-defang-its-own-regulatory-power) to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.
The Constitution pipeline is not a new project. Federal regulators initially approved it in 2014, but New York rejected the project’s water-quality certification in 2016. Legal battles ensued, and in 2020, energy development company Williams dropped the proposal.
Then, in May, the Trump administration [lifted its stop-work order](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/equinor-empire-trump-timeline) on a major offshore wind project under construction off Long Island’s coast, claiming the move was 
In his Boston Globe piece, Zeldin traces New England’s soaring electricity prices — the highest of any region in the continental U.S. — back to an inadequate supply of natural gas to the area’s power plants. The Constitution pipeline would transport more gas into New York, where it could be exported to its neighbors to the East. More gas would mean more reliable power generation and lower electricity prices, Zeldin contends.
It has the ring of a plausible argument. New England’s power producers are heavily dependent on natural gas — 55% of the region’s electricity came from gas-fired plants in 2024 — and leadership at regional grid operator ISO New England has 
“While there are a tremendous amount of ambitions around large-scale renewable energy, we have really struggled to make that operable,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association, a trade group that represents the region’s electricity producers.
Piping more gas up from Pennsylvania’s ample supplies could seem like an economically sensible way to bolster the grid in light of these facts. The reality is far more complicated, however, say advocates and experts.
The major problem is that the pipeline wouldn’t actually bring much, if any, new gas into New England, Dolan said. The Constitution pipeline would terminate in Schoharie County, New York, where it would connect to pipes that already carry gas into New England. That existing infrastructure is the true bottleneck, he said.
The pipes into and around New England are “narrow and limited,” so bringing a higher volume of gas into New York doesn’t mean more can flow throughout the neighboring region. There are no plans in the works to alleviate those constraints, and the models for funding such projects make it highly unlikely there will be any proposals for pipelines into or within New England in the near future, Dolan said.
“I am not aware of any large-scale gas supply projects into New England today,” he said. “Until there is a way to increase that, I struggle to see how Constitution changes anything meaningful for us.”
Furthermore, multiple New England states are enacting plans to transition away from natural gas for home heating and appliances. In late 2023, Massachusetts regulators laid out plans for transitioning gas utilities toward clean energy, with the explicit goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. In May 2025, Maine opened an investigation into the future of its gas utilities. These efforts could reduce demand for natural gas for heating, freeing up some supply for power plants, Dolan said.
Even if new pipelines increased New England’s gas supply, that influx of fuel would be unlikely to consistently lower prices in the long term, experts said. Despite the appealing logic that more supply leads to lower costs, natural gas prices are inherently volatile and susceptible to influence by global events. In 2022, for example, the wholesale price more than tripled from its 2020 level, hitting $6.45 per million British thermal units, after Russia invaded Ukraine. Last year, the average price was $2.20; next year it is forecast to hit $4.30, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
“The region is already over-reliant on natural gas,” said Sarah Krame, staff attorney with the Sierra Club’s environmental law program. “That is why we have seen volatile and skyrocketing gas and electricity bills in recent years.”
A better solution to both price and reliability worries, said advocates, would be to build a system that simply requires less gas.
That would mean relying on a diverse portfolio of options that includes solar, offshore wind, battery storage, energy efficiency, and [demand-response programs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/guides-and-how-tos/the-power-grid-explained-plus-demand-response-virtual-power-plants-and-more#:~:text=in%20a%C2%A0box%E2%80%9D-,%F0%9F%93%9E%20demand%20response,-Say%20there%E2%80%99s%20a). Such resources could be coordinated to create virtual power plants — a collection of geographically distributed resources that can work together to supply power to the grid and reduce demand. Not only do these networks emit less greenhouse gases than fossil-fueled plants, but their components can be built more quickly and cheaply, McDiarmid said.
This approach already had a chance to prove itself this summer, when solar and storage worked together to [lower peak demand](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/northeast-heat-wave-solar-battery-benefits) during a heat wave that saw temperatures hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit around the region, noted Amy Boyd Rabin, vice president of policy and regulatory affairs at the Environmental League of Massachusetts.

Hardly any are being built.,2 September 2025,Paul Cobler,"Even with a financial leg-up from taxpayers, builders are backing off gas plans, worried about profitability or that they won’t be able to get a hold of equipment. 
Vistra Corp.’s Midlothian power plant. State lawmakers have approved more than $7 billion to provide low-interest loans to companies that agree to build more gas-fired power plants in Texas. (Shelby Tauber for The Texas Tribune)
_This_ _was originally published by The Texas Tribune._
When Texas legislators conceived of the Texas Energy Fund in the spring of 2023, its goal of jump-starting the construction of more natural gas power plants to support the state’s strained power grid seemed reasonable.
In the two years since that vote, however, experts say the energy market has turned against the development of gas-fired power plants. Experts and energy companies say the fund’s $7.2 billion worth of low-interest loans and bonus grants may not be appealing enough to overcome those economic headwinds.
“It is a challenging market for natural gas developers right now, and it has been for a good amount of time,” said Walt Baum, CEO of Powering Texans, a trade association representing Calpine, Constellation, NRG, and Vistra, the state’s four largest operators of dispatchable power.
Only two new proposals have been approved so far through the TEF’s In-ERCOT Generation Loan Program, one of four programs included in the fund intended to coax energy companies into building new gas power plants. The two loans, both to be paid back over 20 years at a 3% interest rate, would tap just $321 million of the $7.2 billion total.
Together, the plants would have a capacity to generate 578 megawatts of electricity, a drop in the bucket compared to the roughly 62,500 megawatts of additional electricity that regulators forecast the state will need to generate by 2030.
Another 15 loan applications are currently in the pipeline, totalling 8,392 megawatts, according to the Public Utility Commission, which administers the TEF.
But of the 25 total loan applications that have advanced to the fund’s due diligence review stage, seven have been pulled from consideration by the companies that filed them, citing supply chain issues or forecasts that the projects would not be as profitable as expected. An eighth application was denied funding last fall 
The most recent company to withdraw an application, Hunt Energy Network, cited the cost-effectiveness of constructing a natural gas power plant under the loan program as the reason for its withdrawal, 
## **Winter storm sparked loan fund**
The fund was created in the wake of Winter Storm Uri, the February 2021 storm that plunged most of the state into blackouts during freezing weather for days, leaving hundreds of people dead.
Gov. Greg Abbott and other Republican leaders were quick to blame trouble with wind and solar power generation for the power outages. While renewables did struggle to generate electricity in the frigid temperatures, so did natural gas power generation after power plant equipment and some pipelines that supply gas to the plants froze.
After that disaster, lawmakers argued that the state needed more on-demand power — specifically natural gas power plants — that doesn’t require wind and sun to generate electricity. They started the Texas Energy Fund with an initial $5 billion, and earlier this year added another $5 billion — but $2.8 billion was set aside for separate programs to support backup power generation for critical infrastructure and modernization incentives for natural gas plants.
But since 2023, the economic factors working against the development of natural gas plants have only worsened.
Energy demand is rising globally due to the construction of new data centers for artificial intelligence, and many regions are turning to natural gas power because of its relative affordability, lower emissions compared to coal, and its ability to operate at all times of the day, unlike wind and solar.
That demand is straining the supply chain for turbines, specialized equipment used in power plants that cost tens of millions of dollars. Wait times on orders for the machinery have 
A turbine order placed today likely would not arrive before 2029, and only if a company were willing to pay a premium to get it quickly, said Doug Lewin, 
At the same time, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the state’s power grid operator, is predicting energy demand in the state will double by 2030. The increase is driven by oil and gas operators in the Permian Basin transitioning operations to run on electricity rather than gas or diesel, as well as Texas’ own AI and data center boom.
The state is on course to meet those electricity demands, but largely through advancements in solar technology and battery storage, which are significantly cheaper than natural gas power plants to install. In Texas’ deregulated energy market, which gives preference to the least-expensive power, this takes away the forecast market share available to companies hoping to profit from a new natural gas power plant, meaning the plants cost more to install and are likely to make less money over time, said Dennis Wamsted, an energy analyst with the nonprofit Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.
“Markets speak loud and clear if you listen to what they’re saying,” Wamsted said. “The market in Texas is saying loud and clear that gas is not going to be built any time soon.”
Legislators this spring have responded by extending the deadline for spending the $5 billion they approved in 2023. Under the original legislation creating the fund, the PUC had until the end of this year to distribute the money earmarked for power plant construction loans. Senate Bill 2268 by state Sen. Charles Schwertner, R-Georgetown, gave the PUC authority to extend that deadline if “market factors necessitate.”
“What we didn’t know two years ago is that various market influences would affect the TEF application process, such that supply chain disruptions … would impact the timeline for several otherwise well-qualified projects,” Schwertner said in an April committee hearing about the bill.
## **PUC says interest remains high for loans**
The PUC said in a statement that demand for the natural gas plant loan program has been high, citing the 15 applications that have reached the due diligence review stage. The agency said it is focusing on reaching loan agreements for those 15 applicants before deciding if an extension on the disbursement deadline is necessary.
State Rep. Rafael Anchía, D-Dallas, said he believes those who have applied for loans were planning to build a natural gas plant without the state energy fund and are now asking taxpayers to help cover the cost.
“If taxpayers are subsidizing a lower interest rate than what they could get in the market, of course [energy companies] will take a free ride,” Anchía said.
Anchía voted against SB 2268, calling the loan program a “big government” approach to influencing the energy market. He did vote for the additional $5 billion in money for the fund, citing the fund’s two other programs supporting backup power generation for critical infrastructure and modernization incentives for natural gas units.
Members of the Legislature’s Texas Energy Fund Advisory Committee have not met since October but plan to in the coming months as part of a regular review of the effectiveness of the fund’s policies, said Rep. Ana Hernandez, D-Houston, and a member of the committee.
Rep. David Spiller, R-Jacksboro and cochair of the advisory committee, said he believes the fund’s effectiveness is worth studying because the Legislature’s original intention was to bring these gas plants online quickly.
“We know that over a period of time we will get to where we need to be,” Spiller said. “My concern is over the next five or six years, bridging that gap. I think sooner rather than later, we need to look at that and maybe review what we have in place and tweak it some.”

The [deadly explosion in Clairton, Pennsylvania](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/clairton-coke-works-explosion), this month shone a light on a niche type of industrial facility: coking plants, which purify coal for use in traditional steelmaking. The Clairton facility had a long history of environmental and safety issues, but there are 10 other coking plants in the United States, and all of them are part of a steelmaking process that experts say is risky, dirty, and outdated.
Last week, the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project released 
A growing coalition of clean-air advocates, community members, and former steelworkers is urging America’s steel producers to shift away from coal and invest in cleaner manufacturing methods. In the meantime, EIP said its new research underscores the need to increase federal scrutiny of traditional steel plants while they still exist — instead of pulling back, as the Trump administration has done in recent months.
“The industry needs more accountability and oversight, not less, to protect workers and neighbors,” Jen Duggan, EIP’s executive director, said on a call with reporters.
Researchers analyzed fenceline monitoring data that manufacturers collected at 20 steel-related facilities from October 2022 to April 2023. The Biden administration’s Environmental Protection Agency had required coking plants and steel mills to monitor emissions during that period as the agency developed new air pollution standards for the industry.

For the report, EIP said it compared the pollution data to thresholds established by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, since the federal EPA and many states don’t set chronic or long-term exposure limits on benzene and chromium in the air we breathe. The California standards are also considered to be more protective of public health than the federal thresholds that trigger actions to clean up the two substances.
“The concentrations that we’re seeing at the fenceline and inside the facilities … are unhealthy for long-term exposure for both workers and in the community,” Duggan said.
EIP also looked at regulatory compliance data for the 20 facilities. Seventeen of the sites were out of compliance with the Clean Air Act for at least one three-month period over the last three years. Noncompliance can mean that a company exceeded legal emissions limits, or that it failed to obtain necessary air-quality permits or to comply with monitoring requirements.
Ten of those plants, including Clairton Coke Works, were out of compliance for every quarter during the three-year span. Clairton drew $10.7 million in penalties for Clean Air Act violations over the last five years, more than any of the other steel facilities.

The EPA amended the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for coking plants, setting caps on previously unregulated air pollutants and requiring facilities to monitor and report their fenceline emissions of benzene. Compliance deadlines were set to begin on July 7, 2025.
Last month, however, the Trump administration “may be infeasible for sources to adhere to.” The current EPA gave steel-sector coking operations a two-year extension to July 5, 2027, having already 
U.S. Steel said the EPA concluded that existing air pollution rules from 2003 “are protective of human health and the environment with an ample margin of safety.” The 2024 Biden-era rules “were not risk driven but were developed based on a misinterpretation and application of the Clean Air Act,” Andrew Fulton, a spokesperson for U.S. Steel, said in an emailed statement.
Mon Valley Works — which includes Clairton Coke Works — and the Gary Works facilities “have achieved a compliance rate exceeding 99%, a testament to our employees’ dedication, skill, and care for the communities they work and live in,” Fulton said. He added that “environmental stewardship is a core value at U.S. Steel, and we remain committed to the safety of our communities.”
Environmental groups and residents of steel towns are pushing back against the delay. EIP and other organizations 
Fenceline monitoring “is the bare minimum of what justice requires,” said Qiyam Ansari, executive director of Valley Clean Air Now, a community-led organization in the Pittsburgh area. Ansari said he saw and felt the explosion at Clairton Coke Works while driving to work on Aug. 11. His group responded by distributing air purifiers, masks, and water to families in the area.

Instead, Trump is propping up a false solution: old, unprofitable coal plants.

The Trump administration is threatening to force U.S. grid operators and utilities to keep money-losing coal-fired power plants running, no matter how dirty and expensive their power is.
Its stated reason? To shore up the reliability of the U.S. power grid.
It’s the latest salvo in a long-running battle over the country’s increasingly brittle grid — one that pits those in favor of hanging on to fossil fuels, and particularly coal, against those who put their faith in a future powered by cleaner and cheaper alternatives.
That battle is entering a critical phase as the grid faces challenges on multiple fronts.
Ever more intense [summer heat waves](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/why-are-blackouts-looming-blame-extreme-weather-not-wind-and-solar) and [winter cold snaps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/natural-gas-is-the-pillar-of-the-us-electric-grid-its-also-unreliable) driven by climate change are already straining the grid. An unprecedented [boom in electricity demand](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/data-centers-are-driving-us-power-demand-to-hard-to-reach-heights), spurred by AI data centers and a resurgent manufacturing sector, threatens to push the grid even closer to its limit. Meanwhile, [aging and unprofitable coal power plants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/clean-energy-is-cheaper-than-coal-across-the-whole-us-study-finds) have been closing at a rapid clip — and [grid backlogs are preventing](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/the-growing-clean-energy-backlog-in-five-charts) new solar, wind, batteries, and even fossil-gas plants from being built fast enough to replace them.
If these imbalances persist, more than half of North America faces 10 years, according to a 2024 report from the North American Electric Reliability Corp., which oversees the nation’s electric system. Utilities and regional grid operators are sounding the same alarm. Many say they need to [build more fossil gas–fired power plants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/more-demand-more-gas-inside-the-southeasts-dirty-power-push) and 
But energy experts insist that there’s no single, simple solution to this high-stakes challenge. Maintaining reliability will certainly require retaining some otherwise unprofitable fossil-fueled power plants. But it also requires pressing utilities and regional grid operators to rapidly bring solar, wind, and batteries online — and enlisting electricity users to [shift power use to reduce costly peaks](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/one-way-data-centers-can-help-the-grid-by-being-flexible) in demand.
This multifaceted approach would bolster the grid without sacrificing cost and climate concerns. Flocking back to coal and ratcheting up gas, meanwhile, would cost consumers more, increase climate and air pollution, and ultimately result in a less diversified and therefore more fragile grid than one balanced by renewables.
In the longer term, the U.S. must break barriers to [building far more high-voltage power lines](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/lots-of-demand-too-little-grid-the-us-power-sector-in-2024) to connect clean energy across regions and share power when extreme weather strikes, experts say. It also needs to support the economics for “clean firm” technologies like [advanced nuclear](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear) and enhanced [geothermal power](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal), or [long-duration energy storage](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/long-duration-energy-storage) systems that can fill the gaps when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing.
“Reliability is actually a characteristic of the entire electricity system, and individual resources contribute to reliability as part of a balanced portfolio,” Sara Baldwin, senior electrification director at think tank Energy Innovation, said during a March webinar introducing the group’s 
“So whenever you hear someone talking about the reliability of a single resource, that should raise a flag that is not necessarily grounded in full truth,” she said.
## **Why coal isn’t going to save the grid**
Baldwin’s “single resource” comment nods to a common refrain from the Trump administration and congressional Republicans that today’s grid reliability problems have a simple solution: Keep burning coal.
Last week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order that authorizes the Department of Energy to [prevent uneconomical coal plants from closing](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/trump-coal-power-order-reliability), even if they’re violating federal and state carbon and environmental mandates and imposing higher power costs on customers. This would be the most aggressive federal intervention in modern history into the authority of states to regulate utilities, and of regional grid operators to manage competitive energy markets.
Many Republicans in Congress have long insisted that grid reliability problems are primarily caused by climate and clean-energy policies put in place by states and the Biden administration. They argue that regulations, not economics, are forcing coal plants into “premature” retirement and that cleaner alternatives can’t be relied on to fill the gap left by those retirements.
During “Too many electric-generating facilities have been retired in recent years,” said Rep. Bob Latta, an Ohio Republican who chairs the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee that held the hearings.
Under questioning, most representatives of the U.S. grid operators, which are responsible for managing the systems that deliver electricity to about two-thirds of U.S. customers, 
But Rep. Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat and ranking member on the energy subcommittee, pushed back on Republicans’ framing. Instead of trying to keep coal plants open, he said, utilities, grid operators, and regulators must clear bottlenecks preventing new clean energy and energy storage from taking over the role that fossil fuels have previously played.
Grid operators are “saying they need every new electricity generator they can get to come online in the next five years,” Pallone said. “If Republicans are really interested in unleashing American energy, they should work with us to clear interconnection queues and let resources get on the grid as quickly as possible.”
Instead, Republicans are considering [repealing the clean-energy tax credits](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/ira-tax-credits-electric-bills) created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, Pallone said in 
“Repealing billions of dollars in technology-neutral funding for all types of new energy is not the way you address the increasing need for energy,” he said. 
## **Getting the grid-reliability diagnosis right**
Pallone’s comments underscore two of the biggest problems facing the U.S. grid.
The first is that coal simply cannot compete economically against alternatives. Coal has dwindled to providing [only about 15% of U.S. electricity supply](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/wind-and-solar-overtook-coal-on-the-us-grid-in-2024), as both fossil gas and renewables fall in cost. Last year, solar, wind, and batteries alone [made up more than 90%](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-96-percent-of-new-us-power-capacity-was-carbon-free-in-2024) of the 56 gigawatts of power capacity built in the U.S., and they are expected to [lead new additions in 2025](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-solar-batteries-to-lead-us-power-plant-construction-in-2025), too.
The second problem is that many U.S. utilities and grid operators have been unable to move fast enough to embrace the advantages of cheap, clean energy. As Energy Innovation’s February report highlights, “outdated views on grid reliability are colliding with slow-moving institutions,” which has confounded the potential for solar, wind, and batteries to fill the reliability gaps left by shuttered coal plants.
Much of the reluctance from certain grid operators stems from the fact that solar and wind ebb and flow with the weather, whereas fossil-fueled power plants can be turned on and off on command.
“Renewable generators play an important role, and we want them to come onto the grid, but they are not a one-for-one substitute for the fossil-fuel generators that we are replacing,” said Manu Asthana, president and CEO of PJM Interconnection, which manages the transmission grid delivering electricity to about 65 million people from the mid-Atlantic coast to the Great Lakes.
But daytime solar production and nighttime wind generation can still provide a large and predictable amount of the power needed during hot summer afternoons and evenings and cold winter mornings, when demand for electricity spikes and reliability issues loom, said Wilson Ricks, a researcher and energy-modeling expert at Princeton University’s [ZERO Lab](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/emissions-reduction/the-inflation-reduction-act-will-drive-down-emissions-but-how-much).
Meanwhile, lithium-ion batteries are becoming a more cost-effective way to store clean power for use when the grid needs it, he said. [Utility-scale batteries](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/batteries/batteries-are-taking-on-gas-plants-to-power-californias-nights) deployed in California and Texas are [storing gigawatts of solar power](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/solar-and-batteries-are-helping-texas-weather-heatwaves-heres-how) to cover peak grid demands during sunset and evening hours, for example.
Taken together, “the technologies that are currently experiencing widespread commercial adoption — wind, solar, lithium-ion batteries — can actually go a long way towards ensuring that system-wide resource accuracy,” Ricks said during last month’s webinar.
Real-world experience bears this out, said Ric O’Connell, founding executive director of GridLab, a think tank that contributed to the Energy Innovation reliability report. The standout example is Texas, which is adding wind, solar, and batteries faster than any other state.
The transmission grid operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas “has been running at 85% carbon-free for the last several weeks in the spring,” O’Connell said during the webinar. That clean power has [helped cover the absence of fossil-fueled plants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/texas-broke-its-solar-wind-and-battery-records-in-one-spring-week) that were shut down for seasonal maintenance, he noted.
Similarly, Southwest Power Pool, which manages a grid stretching from the Dakotas to Oklahoma, 
Last year, on California’s solar- and battery-rich grid, grid operator CAISO clocked 100 days in a row [with 100% carbon-free electricity](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/california-hits-milestones-toward-100-clean-energy-but-has-a-long-way-to-go) for at least a part of each day. Gigawatts of battery capacity also improved the state’s summer grid reliability by shifting solar power into the evenings.
That’s a big change from the summers of 2020 and 2022, when the California grid faced serious emergencies, CAISO CEO Elliot Mainzer told Congress during last month’s hearings.
“A reliable grid relies on a portfolio of resources with different attributes and complementary characteristics,” he said. Pairing batteries with solar “has helped to increase reliability in recent years.”
By contrast, O’Connell said, PJM’s grid “is in the single digits for wind and solar. PJM has tons of gas, tons of coal, tons of nuclear — and they say, ‘We need even more to meet growing load.’ I’m like, ‘No, we need to add wind and solar and batteries to meet that growing load.’” 
## **Crying wolf on “premature” coal retirements? **
PJM’s grid is a microcosm of this problematic dynamic.
The region expects to lose about 40 gigawatts of generation, more than 20% of its capacity, by 2030. But critics say its bigger challenge is its [inability to interconnect new resources](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/a-backed-up-grid-threatens-clean-energy-growth-from-virginia-to-illinois) to replace what it’s losing.
For years, [PJM delayed interconnection reforms](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/a-backed-up-grid-threatens-clean-energy-growth-from-virginia-to-illinois) conducted by other grid operators. It has also failed until recently to [undertake the kind of regional grid expansion plans](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/ferc-passed-big-transmission-reforms-now-the-hard-part-begins) that have been done by grid operators in Texas, California, and the Midwest, which have enabled them to bring much more clean energy online.
Critics say PJM’s failure to institute these reforms and forward-looking plans has played an outsized role in its struggle to replace retiring power plants and in the spiking cost of securing new generation resources. Multiple studies find PJM could have 
Instead, state regulators and grid operators have been forced to use costly emergency mechanisms to keep power plants from closing. In Maryland, for example, PJM has [used its “reliability must-run” authority](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/zombie-coal-plants-could-threaten-the-us-energy-transition) to pay the owners of coal- and oil-fired power plants to postpone their retirements until at least 2028 to prevent the threat of regional grid instability or outages, at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars in the coming years.
The high price tag of these emergency stay-open measures highlights the economic burden of poor planning around power plant retirements, O’Connell said.
Those costs are bound to rise if the Trump administration forces coal power plants to stay open under emergency orders — or even demands that 
These poor economics are why backers of renewables are frustrated with those who insist that clean-energy policies are to blame for coal plants closing and thus for grid reliability challenges. 
“People are retiring coal plants because they’re uneconomic,” O’Connell said.
Karen Palmer, a senior fellow and director of the electric power program at think tank Resources for the Future, agreed that coal retirements are “not the fault of environmental regulation. The market prices just aren’t there.”
Nor are 
And [major wintertime grid emergencies](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/natural-gas-is-the-pillar-of-the-us-electric-grid-its-also-unreliable) of the past several years, such as the Texas grid collapse in February 2021 and rolling outages in the Southeast in December 2022, have been linked to cold-related failures not only at coal and gas-fired power plants but across the wells and pipelines that deliver gas to generate power.
No one technology is immune to weather stresses and disruptions. Subzero temperatures can freeze up wind turbines and sap battery capacity, and scorching temperatures reduce solar-panel output and dampen battery performance. But this reinforces the importance of a portfolio approach to solving reliability challenges, Baldwin said.
## **No simple fix for a looming grid crisis**
None of this is to downplay the complexity that grid operators face — particularly at a time when demand for electricity is growing at a pace not seen in decades.
The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which manages a grid serving 15 U.S. states from Louisiana to North Dakota, warned last year that its 
In New York, state grid operator “very concerning decline in statewide resource margins” by 2034 unless it can expand clean-energy deployments, [which lag behind state targets](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/missed-deadlines-pile-up-as-new-yorks-climate-law-turns-five). NYISO has already delayed the closure of some NYISO CEO Richard Dewey said at the March 25 congressional hearing.
ISO New England, which manages the grid across six New England states, is struggling during winter cold snaps to meet simultaneous demand for gas for heating and for generating power, CEO and President Gordon van Welie [Canadian hydropower in the near term](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydropower/canadian-hydroelectric-new-england-cutoff) and [offshore wind farms in the longer term](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/zeldin-atlantic-shores-permit-epa), he said — both sources threatened by Trump administration policies.
And while grid operators at last month’s hearing concurred with Republicans that losing existing generation is one reliability threat, they also agreed that losing federal clean-energy tax credits is another. Rep. Diana DeGette, a Democrat from Colorado, asked PJM’s Asthana if losing Inflation Reduction Act funding would “help or hurt our ability to stabilize the grid and to increase production.”
“In the near term, the interconnection queue is full of a lot of renewable projects, many of whom are, I’m sure, counting on the IRA,” Asthana replied. Repealing those tax credits “would make it less likely for them to come — and we do need them to come.”
“Anybody disagree with that on this panel?” DeGette asked the other grid operators. “No? They’re all shaking their heads no.”

The Department of Energy has once again delayed the retirement of an oil- and gas-fired power plant, adding to concerns that the Trump administration aims to prevent any fossil-fueled power plant from closing during its term.
Today, the Trump administration 90 days. The plant’s two main units, totaling 760 megawatts, were originally set to shutter on May 31, but one day before their scheduled retirement, the DOE
Eddystone is not the only fossil-fueled power plant being forced to stay open past its closing date. Last week, the Trump administration [extended its emergency stay-open order](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/trump-extend-campbell-michigan-coal-plant) for the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan, which was also slated to close in May.
Before this year, the DOE had [wielded its emergency powers sparingly](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/trump-coal-plant-order-challenges), issuing orders mostly in response to utilities or grid operators who requested federal restrictions be lifted during times of extreme strain on the grid. It has never before used Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act to intervene in a power plant retirement, according to Caroline Reiser, senior attorney for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
But under President Donald Trump, the agency is invoking those powers to extend the life of fossil-fueled units that grid planners had already deemed unnecessary, raising costs for consumers and stalling the transition to carbon-free energy.
In today’s order, the DOE once again pointed to an “emergency” in portions of the electricity grid operated by PJM Interconnection, which serves Washington, D.C., and 13 states from Illinois to Virginia. The agency cited recent reports from PJM that found, among other things, that the grid operator could struggle to keep up with demand this summer during heat waves.
The DOE said in the new order that the emergency conditions that led to the first directive are still in place, as summer isn’t over. The Eddystone station’s units 3 and 4 generated over 17,000 megawatt-hours during June, per U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data cited by DOE. They also ran for a combined total of 47 hours during a three-day spell of hot weather in late July.
The order also cites a [widely criticized](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/trump-doe-report-open-coal-plants) report that the DOE released in July, which energy experts say vastly overstates the risk of grid outages. The citation further confirms fears that the Trump administration will use the [methodologically flawed report](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/states-demand-trump-fix-grid-reliability-report) to continue to justify keeping aging, expensive fossil-fueled power plants online.
PJM has supported both stay-open orders, calling each one a “prudent, term-limited step” that would allow the DOE, PJM, and Eddystone’s owner, Constellation Energy, to analyze the longer-term need for these generators.
“PJM has previously documented its concerns over the growing risk of a supply and demand imbalance driven by the confluence of generator retirements and demand growth,” a spokesperson said in an emailed statement about the new order. “Such an imbalance could have serious ramifications for reliability and affordability for consumers.”
Regulators, energy experts, and advocates have questioned the DOE’s justification for keeping the Eddystone and the J.H. Campbell plants open. They point to the fact that the power plants’ owners, state officials, regional grid operators — including PJM itself — and other experts spent years evaluating the impact of closing these facilities and decided it was safe to shut them down.
For its part, the Eddystone plant has operated infrequently in recent years because the facility was not economical. Constellation filed a deactivation notice with PJM in December 2023, which was “did not identify any reliability violations” from the shutdown.
In June, state utility regulators and environmental groups [filed](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/trump-coal-plant-order-challenges) rehearing requests with the DOE in an attempt to force the agency to reconsider its emergency orders. The agency denied those requests, clearing the way for critics, 
Advocates fear that these directives, taken together with recent executive orders and other DOE moves, signal the Trump administration’s commitment to keeping every fossil-fuel plant running, no matter the consequences.
In total, just over 38 gigawatts’ worth of power plants are 2028, more than two-thirds of which is coal.
Blocking all planned closures of fossil-fueled power plants would be disastrous for efforts to decarbonize the U.S. power grid — and also for consumers, who are already navigating [fast-rising power bills](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/electricity-prices-rising-trump-impact).

The Trump administration has extended its order to keep a Michigan coal-fired power plant running until November, well past its planned closure in the spring. It’s the latest move in a push to force dirty, expensive power plants to keep operating, which experts warn could saddle Americans with billions of dollars in unnecessary electricity costs.
Just days before the J.H. Campbell plant was set to shutter in May, the administration ordered it to [stay open for 90 days](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/a-michigan-coal-plant-was-about-to-close-trump-ordered-it-to-stay-open) — an unprecedented federal intervention in state-regulated utility operations. That order has already cost Midwest utility customers millions, and Michigan’s top utility regulator estimates that keeping the aging plant open longer could burden consumers with more than $100 million in unnecessary costs.
The Department of Energy’s Wednesday [between $3 billion and nearly $6 billion](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/forcing-dirty-power-plants-to-stay-open-would-cost-americans-billions) per year by the end of President Donald Trump’s term, per an August report from consultancy Grid Strategies.
“The order purports to override the considered judgment and careful work of many federal, state, and regional bodies who actually have authority to keep the lights on,” Michael Lenoff, senior attorney for nonprofit Earthjustice, said in a Thursday statement.

To keep fossil-fueled plants running, the Trump administration is taking advantage of Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, which “points to no evidence of an imminent emergency requiring Campbell to keep racking up the bills paid by customers in Michigan and nearby states,” Lenoff said.
“Despite already forcing the plant to run for 90 days, [Wright] points to not a single instance where the plant was needed to keep the lights on,” Lenoff said.
Consumers Energy, the utility that owns J.H. Campbell, reported in late July that it cost $29 million DOE’s stay-open order.

“The coal-fired J.H. Campbell plant has reached the end of its life. Michigan cannot afford to let political interference prolong its operation,” Justin Carpenter, policy director for the Michigan Energy Innovation Business Council, said in a Thursday statement. “So-called temporary extensions only keep an unnecessary, inefficient plant alive, extending its pollution and high costs.”
Later in May, the DOE also used its Section 202(c) authority to order the DOE’s 90-day order for the Eddystone plant is set to expire in late August.
Lawmakers, advocates, and industry experts are increasingly concerned that the Trump administration intends to apply its Section 202(c) authority more broadly. In particular, critics fear a 
The document was written to comply with an April [taking unilateral authority over power-plant closures](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/trump-coal-power-order-reliability), circumventing decades-old structures that utilities, state and federal regulators, and regional grid operators follow to determine when power plants can close or when they must stay open.
Earlier this month, clean-energy trade groups and nine Democrat-led states [filed rehearing requests with the DOE](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/states-demand-trump-fix-grid-reliability-report) asking it to redo the July grid-reliability report.

Running aging power plants is expensive for utility customers, both in terms of direct costs on energy bills and the indirect costs of crowding out new, cheaper renewables. Utilities and independent energy developers will build less solar, batteries, and wind power if those plants stay online.

In the new study, the team used benzene measurements from gas stoves in 87 homes, analyzing the health risks for the highest-emitting 5% of stoves by modeling how the carcinogen lingers in different rooms across several types of U.S. housing.
There’s 70-year lifetime.
Researchers found the added lifetime cancer risk associated with benzene from gas stoves is much higher. For example, in homes that use gas stoves often and without ventilation, the risk from just the benzene that drifted into bedrooms ranged from about two to 12 in a million additional cancer cases for children and from about one to six in a million for adults, according to the modeling.
Accounting for exposure across the whole home, gas stove benzene increased cancer risk for kids by up to 1.85 times the risk for adults.
New research finds that gas stoves raise cancer risks in adults and kids by emitting benzene, a known carcinogen. (
Ventilating with a high-efficiency range hood or by opening the windows could help decrease the risk, the team found, but couldn’t eradicate it completely.
“The only way to eliminate the exposure is to replace a gas or propane stove with a non-emitting induction or other electric stove,” Rob Jackson, senior author of the study and Earth systems professor at Stanford, told Canary Media.
About 47 million homes, the team estimates that 6.3 million Americans are breathing in benzene from their gas stoves at the levels modelled.
How do you know if your gas stove is one of the most polluting? “You don’t,” Jackson said.
Jackson wants policymakers to incentivize a transition to electric cooking. “The switch from dirty fossil fuels to cleaner electricity will save lives and make us healthier,” he said. “The World Health Organization believes that breathing any extra benzene is bad for us, no matter how small the amount.”

The Trump administration has made clear it intends to use the authority of the federal government to prevent fossil-fueled power plants from closing, despite their environmental and economic costs.
Last week, the Department of Energy issued a 
The report came with an eye-catching topline finding: Absent “radical change,” power outages could increase a hundredfold across the country by 2030. It claims blackout risks will rise due to exponential growth in power demand from AI data centers and due to the closure of fossil-fueled plants that aren’t replaced by “firm” resources. Solar, wind, and batteries make up the [vast majority of new power](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-96-percent-of-new-us-power-capacity-was-carbon-free-in-2024) being added to the grid, and the report does not consider any combination of them to be firm.
But energy-modeling experts who examined the report say its dire conclusions appear to be based on significant flaws.
The report overestimates how many power plants will close by 2030. It assumes increasing demand for electricity that’s on the extreme end of load growth forecasts for AI data centers and broader economic growth. And it severely undercounts new generation capacity expected to be added to U.S. grids through 2030, which “aggressively downplays the potential for new wind, solar, batteries, and gas to ensure reliability,” said Wilson Ricks, a researcher and energy-modeling expert at Princeton University’s ZERO Lab.
“The report’s scenarios seem designed around worst-case assumptions,” he said.
DOE’s report was spurred by an executive order issued as part of President Donald Trump’s “Beautiful Clean Coal” policy blitz in April. The order provides a road map for the [DOE to unilaterally order any power plant to keep operating](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/trump-coal-power-order-reliability), in contravention of the long-established process whereby grid reliability decisions are made by utilities, state regulators, regional grid operators, federal regulators, and other experts.
The DOE has already used emergency authority under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act to order two fossil-fueled power plants on the verge of shutting down — the [J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/a-michigan-coal-plant-was-about-to-close-trump-ordered-it-to-stay-open) and the 
“The report is designed to deliver a message: The U.S. power system faces imminent reliability risks driven by the ‘radical green agenda of past administrations,’ i.e., solar and wind,” John Miller, energy transition policy analyst at financial services firm TD Cowen, wrote in a note last week. “Establishing this narrative is a necessary precondition to enable ongoing ‘federal reliability interventions’ to bolster baseload (coal/​gas) resources.”
Brendan Pierpont, director of electricity modeling for think tank Energy Innovation, questioned the usefulness of DOE’s analysis to make the kind of “decisive intervention” in U.S. power grids that it calls for.
“If they’re using this to say, ‘This region is going to experience reliability shortfalls,’ they don’t have a basis to do that if they’re ignoring the large majority of resources that are planned to be built,” he said.
A DOE spokesperson defended the report in an email to Canary Media, saying that it is meant to “identify potential reliability gaps if only the most certain resources come online. This allows policymakers, regulators, and planners to understand the risks we would face in a scenario where anticipated additions are delayed or derailed, and to take proactive action.”
## **DOE ’s missing gigawatts of new generation capacity**
Analysts were particularly perplexed by the report’s low estimates of new generation expected to be added to the grid by 2030 — just 209 gigawatts, of which only 22 GW was classified as “firm.” To reach those numbers, the DOE used data from the NERC), a nonprofit regulatory authority that includes utilities and grid operators in the U.S. and Canada.
But Ricks pointed out that NERC’s report includes nearly 400 GW of likely additions to the U.S. grid by 2030, of which roughly 50 GW are fossil-fueled power plants. That’s nearly twice as much overall new generation as the DOE accounted for.
The main discrepancy, Ricks and Pierpont said, appears to be DOE’s decision to use only a subset of data on the generation being planned across the country.
NERC differentiates between “Tier 1” resources, or those “in the final stages for connection,” and “Tier 2” projects, which are “further from completion.” DOE’s report states that it includes only “mature generation additions based on NERC’s Tier 1 resources category” in analyzing grid conditions by 2030.
But this leaves out large amounts of new generation capacity set to be added to the grid, largely from 2027 to 2030.
That includes the power plants that state-regulated utilities are seeking permission to build to meet rapidly growing demand for power. Those buildouts involve large amounts of renewables and batteries, but also [lots of gas-fired plants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/more-demand-more-gas-inside-the-southeasts-dirty-power-push) — and while they haven’t yet reached the “shovel-ready” status of Tier 1 projects, they form a part of utilities and regulators’ grid reliability considerations. In other words, at least some of these projects are likely to be built.
The report also leaves out the hundreds of gigawatts of projects from independent energy developers [seeking interconnection](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/the-growing-clean-energy-backlog-in-five-charts) with the regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs) that manage transmission grids and energy markets covering about two-thirds of the U.S. population. Most of those projects won’t overcome the permitting, interconnection, and financing challenges to reach completion. But RTOs and ISOs acknowledge at least a portion of these queues in their grid reliability assessments — and the DOE is “just ignoring them in its analysis,” Pierpont said.
The DOE told Canary Media that its use of NERC data “was intentional and grounded in reliability planning principles. By focusing on only the most mature and certain projects, those with signed interconnection agreements, executed power purchase agreements, or inclusion in integrated resource plans, the DOE aimed to model a conservative yet realistic baseline. This approach is consistent with how NERC and planning authorities assess near-term reliability risks.”
The DOE’s report pairs this undercounting with an overcount of power plant retirements, Ricks said. The agency finds that 104 GW of power plants will close by 2030, a figure that combines “confirmed” retirements of about 50 GW with a slightly larger amount of “announced” retirements from NERC’s December 2024 report, he said.
The department’s figure for confirmed retirements appears to align with DOE’s statistics arm, which is tracking 52 GW of capacity scheduled to retire by 2030, according to a 
But its inclusion of announced retirements fails to account for the fact that many power plant closure plans are being “walked back and delayed in response to load growth projections,” said Greg Wannier, senior attorney at the Sierra Club. [Sierra Club opposes delays in closing polluting power plants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/booming-power-demand-is-undermining-us-utility-climate-progress), but effective grid reliability planning ought to take them into account, he said.
As for how much more electricity U.S. grids will need, DOE’s load growth forecast of 101 GW by 2030 is on the high end of expectations, Pierpont said, ”if not outside of the bounds” of reason. The report forecasts 51 GW of increased electricity demand from factories, electric vehicles, and broader economic growth, and another 50 GW from data centers.
The AI boom has created enormous concern about the grid’s ability to keep up. At the same time, many of the [speculative activity by data center developers](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/utilities-are-flying-blind-on-data-center-demand-thats-a-big-problem) that’s largely [concentrated in hot spots](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/data-centers-are-driving-us-power-demand-to-hard-to-reach-heights) such as Virginia, Texas, Georgia, and Ohio.
“What [the DOE is] effectively doing is painting this picture of high load growth and lots of resource retirements, but assuming away the ability of utilities to build the resources they’re planning,” Pierpont said, as well as “the ability of markets to incent new resources to be built beyond those under construction or shovel-ready.”
## **The politics behind the analysis**
To be clear, Ricks said, the criticism is “not to say there aren’t real reliability risks on the horizon.”
Utilities and grid operators are struggling to overcome the grid backlogs preventing new generation from being connected. Climate change-intensified [summer heat waves](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/why-are-blackouts-looming-blame-extreme-weather-not-wind-and-solar) and [winter cold snaps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/natural-gas-is-the-pillar-of-the-us-electric-grid-its-also-unreliable) are increasing the risk of electricity demand exceeding supply. And the [megabill signed into law by President Trump](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/trump-big-beautiful-bill-industry-impacts) on July 4 will make it much more expensive to keep building the solar farms, batteries, and wind turbines that now provide most of the U.S.’s new power.
But given the flaws in DOE’s methodology, it does appear that “this report seems designed from the ground up to justify keeping coal plants open with emergency orders,” Ricks said.
The DOE spokesperson told Canary Media that the report is meant to “complement, not override, the more granular, region-specific planning processes that incorporate a broader range of resources. Future updates may explore alternative scenarios with broader resource assumptions.”
However, the DOE faces a problem in using a study of grid conditions in 2030 to justify such emergency orders, Sierra Club’s Wannier said. The agency’s Section 202(c) authority is strictly limited to solving immediate and unexpected grid emergencies, not to deal with forecasted grid challenges years in the future. State regulators, environmental groups, and consumer advocates have already [challenged DOE’s use of the law](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/trump-coal-plant-order-challenges) to keep the J.H. Campbell and Eddystone plants open.
Section 202(c) also allows the DOE to order plants to stay open for only 90 days at a time, Wannier said. The DOE’s roles in long-term grid planning, which are codified in Section 215 of the Federal Power Act, are strictly limited, ”and for good reason,” he said. “The federal government shouldn’t be stepping on the states and implementing a command-and-control, Soviet-style system.”
Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former gas industry executive and an “stop the closure of reliable plants, so we can keep the lights on and stop pushing up electricity prices.”
But Alison Silverstein, an energy analyst and former adviser to the Public Utility Commission of Texas and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, noted that aging fossil-fueled power plants are less reliable amid extreme weather events responsible for the most damaging grid outages.
“The plants that are most likely to close are the least likely to show up when we need them the most,” she said. “They’re very old, they require a great deal of maintenance, and they are most likely to break when we need them.”
The oldest fossil-fueled plants also tend to be the most expensive to operate, Wannier said. “We’re talking about keeping a potential fleet of hugely expensive oil, coal, gas plants around for five years, when there are untold alternatives available,” he said. “If you need new generation by 2030, build new generation by 2030. Don’t keep old generation around.”","Fossil fuels, Policy regulation",trump-doe-report-open-coal-plants.md,articles_fossil-fuels

Ohio legislators are considering bills that would bar local governments from having a say in permitting projects that capture carbon dioxide emissions and inject them underground. The legislation could even force some landowners to let their property be used for carbon dioxide storage.
The framework proposed in the twin bills being considered by the state House and Senate starkly contrasts with Ohio’s approach to wind and solar farms, most of which can be blocked by counties.
Instead, carbon capture and storage projects would follow a process similar to what’s used for oil and gas drilling, in which property owners must allow development on or below their land if enough neighbors support it.
At least one large energy company, Tenaska, is already talking to Ohio landowners about obtaining rights to drill wells and store carbon dioxide from industrial and energy operations deep underground. An executive with the firm said the legislation would provide “clarity” for its planned carbon storage hub serving Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania.
“This project will provide manufacturers, industrial facilities, and other businesses in this region with a solution to address growing environmental regulations and climate goals,” said Ali Kairys, senior director of project development for Tenaska.
The company is in discussions with various carbon-emitting businesses, including steel refineries, ethanol plants, and power plants. The 
In Ohio, Tenaska is eyeing CO underground. The three counties are among the state’s top oil and gas producers and have a history of coal mining. Tenaska initially hopes to store captured carbon dioxide in the Knox formation, which ranges from 8,500 feet to 12,000 feet below the Earth’s surface, Kairys said. Second-stage storage would use another formation roughly 5,500 to 8,000 feet underground.
Other carbon sequestration projects could be on the horizon. The Great Plains Institute has identified roughly three dozen industrial facilities across the state as 
Ohio’s “sole and exclusive authority to regulate carbon sequestration,” a power the agency also has over oil and gas production via existing law. The [local government regulation](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/ohio-cities-and-state-face-disputes-over-drilling) of drilling, even through general zoning rules that apply to other businesses.
If passed, the bills would similarly deprive counties and townships of any say over sequestration, said Bev Reed, an organizer for the Buckeye Environmental Network. “It’s … another really tragic thing that the Legislature is forcing on us.”
The bills would also authorize a “consolidation” process that operators can undertake to force landowners to allow carbon dioxide storage in their property’s subsurface “pore space” if owners of 70% of the remaining area for an injection project have signed on. The process is similar to that for [unitization](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/as-ohio-clamps-down-on-clean-energy-recent-changes-make-it-easier-to-force-landowners-to-allow-oil-and-gas-drilling), which lets oil and gas companies drill through dissenting landowners’ properties.
The chief of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources’ oil and gas management division would be required to grant consolidation if it was “reasonably necessary to facilitate the underground storage of carbon dioxide.” A landowner could only object on the grounds that the facility’s design threatens “a commercially valuable mineral,” such as oil, gas, or coal.
“You don’t get to object and say this is dangerous, this is ill-conceived or for any other reason,” said Heidi Gorovitz Robertson, a professor at Cleveland State University College of Law. “Reasonably necessary is a very low standard” for forcing property owners to give up the use of their pore space, she added.
Asked to respond to advocacy groups’ complaints that the process is unfair, Tenaska’s Kairys focused instead on landowners’ potential for income.
“A [carbon capture and storage] project allows landowners to benefit from an untapped revenue stream — leasing pore space deep below the surface. This is a passive income stream that has little to no impact on the surface use of the land,” Kairys said. The bills’ structure for compensating landowners “mirrors existing state law for individuals being paid for their mineral rights,” she added.
The bills call for compensation, but it’s subject to adjustments for the developer’s expenses. Companies in oil and gas unitization cases often get to recoup twice their costs before they have to pay landowners more than the law’s minimum 12.5% royalty. Neither HB 170 nor SB 136 requires any minimum payment to landowners. Yet once carbon dioxide is stored underground, landowners presumably couldn’t use or drill through the storage formation.
The bills are currently in the House Natural Resources Committee and the Senate Energy Committee. Primary sponsors are all Republicans: Sen. Tim Schaffer, Sen. Brian Chavez, Rep. Bob Peterson, and Rep. Monica Robb Blasdel.
“Make no mistake, carbon capture storage technology is here,” Robb Blasdel “This General Assembly must act to ensure Ohioans’ rights are protected and their voices are heard.” More hearings are expected in coming weeks.
Critics have dozens of questions, including whether sequestration projects make economic sense and whether they will significantly reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.
“It’s very expensive to retrofit [industrial] facilities to be able to capture the carbon — and very energy-intensive,” Reed said. The process may even cumulatively add carbon pollution to the atmosphere, after accounting for the emissions produced when capturing the CO and injecting it underground, she noted.
Other questions deal with feared drops in property values, chemicals used in the carbon sequestration process, and the [huge amounts of water](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/louisiana-project-highlights-unknowns-of-carbon-capture) that carbon capture technologies require.
People also worry about the potential for carbon dioxide to escape from underground storage or related pipelines, said Randi Pokladnik, an environmental scientist and volunteer for Save Ohio Parks.
Tenaska’s project will include a detailed emergency response plan, Kairys said, adding that carbon dioxide is not flammable. “At extremely high concentrations, carbon dioxide temporarily displaces oxygen. However, carbon dioxide dissipates very, very quickly.”
Dozens of people were hospitalized in 2020 when a carbon dioxide pipeline ruptured. Another carbon dioxide pipeline leaked last year near 
Companies have injected carbon dioxide underground for years to stimulate extra production from oil and gas wells, but it has never been done at the large scale proposed now, Pokladnik said. She worries that gas could migrate upward through fractures in overlying rock layers or other wells, including many [old, abandoned oil wells](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/thousands-of-abandoned-ohio-oil-and-gas-wells-may-be-hidden-drones-could-help-discover-them) whose locations may be unknown.
“We’re in a world where we don’t have any expertise,” Pokladnik said.

An Ohio bill that would establish rules for underground carbon dioxide storage is being shaped behind the scenes by oil and gas companies that stand to benefit from the legislation.
Oil and gas industry groups have been busy for months vetting bill sponsors, drafting legislation, writing talking points for lawmakers, meeting with regulators, and coordinating with other industry stakeholders.
Industry lobbyists often play an active role in pushing for legislation that will favor them. But public records shared with Canary Media by Fieldnotes, a watchdog group that investigates the oil and gas industry, show that the American Petroleum Institute and the Ohio Oil and Gas Association have played an outsize role in shaping the bill.
Supporters say carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS, is necessary to lower greenhouse gas emissions that drive human-caused climate change, especially for hard-to-electrify industries. As lawmakers and regulators craft rules for the technology, the stakes are high, with potentially large risks and rewards for industry and the public.

Left unsaid was that the petroleum industry was then facing Biden-era emissions rules for natural gas plants, which an aide for bill sponsor Sen.

## **“ In the driver’s seat”**
Besides documenting industry’s push for Ohio to pass a carbon capture and storage law, the public records raise questions about whose interests lawmakers are serving.
As Fieldnotes researcher Julia Kane sees it, industry groups that stand to profit have “been in the driver’s seat of this process…I’d think in a democracy you’d want the lawmakers looking out for the interests of the public and talking to all the stakeholders,” she said.
Neither Chavez nor Schaffer responded to Canary Media’s requests for comment. Peterson’s aide, Kylie Fauber, said the representative would defer any comments to Robb Blasdel. She has not answered Canary Media’s questions for this story.
The American Petroleum Institute “regularly engages with policy makers on both sides of the aisle to educate on the critical role of American energy and to share our industry’s priorities,” said Christina Polesovsky, the organization’s associate director for Ohio, in response to Canary Media’s questions about critics who see the group as having outsize influence. She added that the group has provided on-the-record testimony through the committee process.
The Ohio Oil and Gas Association did not answer Canary Media’s request for comment for this story.
Opposing parties have also testified, and Robb Blasdel met with two representatives of the Buckeye Environmental Network on June 4. But they and other opponents were left out of the “interested party” meeting on June 5, before the most recent substitute bill was introduced.
“The cake is most of the way baked, and the oil and gas industry kind of set the foundation for the entire conversation,” Kane said.
While the extent of industry’s involvement in the carbon capture bills wasn’t clear before the most recent batches of the public records were released to Fieldnotes this spring, it’s not necessarily surprising.
“This is the system that we’re in,” said Stephanie Howse-Jones, a Cleveland City Council member who served for seven years as a Democratic representative in the Ohio House. Lobbyists often provide draft bills and talking points. Lawmakers often use those talking points when speaking about legislation, but they don’t always read the full text of their bills, she noted.
Howse-Jones said Ohioans need to understand specifically how bills will impact them and their communities. Getting that information may be more challenging after Ohio’s latest budget bill changed the state’s public records law to shield lawmakers’ notes and some internal communications from disclosure until the next legislative session. But more transparency isn’t enough, she said.
“Ohioans must demand more of their state legislature,” Howse-Jones said. Until campaign finance reform takes place, “most of us won’t be able to compete with the dollars. But we do have organizing-people power.” That goes beyond voting and includes taking an active role in organizing and communicating constituent concerns, she said.
Tristan Rader (D-Lakewood) said he hasn’t made up his mind about the carbon capture bills but has questions, especially whether the waste will escape from the underground spaces in which it will be stored. Yet he sees an imbalance in power at the legislature, where industry often holds more sway.
“The real problem is that the communities that are impacted by the activity of these organizations’ wells have a very minimal presence and limited input. And it’s not for lack of trying,” Rader said.","Carbon capture, Fossil fuels, Policy regulation, Midwest, Ohio",records-show-oil-and-gas-industry-steering-ohio-carbon-capture-bills.md,articles_carbon-capture

YARMOUTH, Maine — At a dock along the banks of the Cousins River, Chad Strater loaded up his small aluminum workboat with power tools and a winch. Strater, who owns a marine construction business, was setting out to tinker with floating equipment at a nearby oyster farm. On the quiet morning in August, with the sun already beating down hard, his vessel whirred to life, only without the usual growl of an oil-guzzling motor. The boat is all electric.
Just north of where the Cousins River meets Casco Bay, Willy Leathers was powering up his own electric watercraft, which had its first outing in July. Leathers uses his 28-foot boat for cultivating oysters at 3 million of the animals grow in dozens of floating cages.
Both Strater and Leathers said they switched to electric workboats for several reasons. Their new watercraft are a cleaner alternative to the smelly, polluting petroleum-powered vessels that dominate Maine’s 3,500 miles of coastline. Electric propulsion is also significantly quieter than a gas or diesel motor. For Leathers, whose 10-acre sea farm is a significant presence in the cove where he operates, the swap is about being a good neighbor to the shoreside community.
“It’s an innovation born from necessity for us,” said Strater about his electric boat, which he docks each night at the 
Battery-powered vessels are starting to catch on in the United States and worldwide as companies and maritime authorities work to reduce emissions and improve the experience of cruising waterways. The technology ranges from small outboard motors on workboats and recreational watercraft to powerful inboard systems on ferries, [tugboats](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/sea-transport/the-first-all-electric-tugboat-in-the-us-is-about-to-launch), and supply vessels for offshore wind farms and oil rigs.
In recent decades, Norway, with its extensive coastline and ample government funding, has spearheaded the transition globally. China, which is both the world’s largest shipbuilder and battery manufacturer, has rapidly deployed hundreds of battery-powered vessels over the last several years. Falling battery costs, better technology, and stricter environmental rules are compelling some vessel owners to install partial or fully electric systems, primarily for watercraft that operate near the shore or on fixed routes. For commercial fishing in particular, customers are helping to drive the push to clean up.
“Everyone’s more concerned now with where their food comes from, and we’ve seen that [consumers] are looking for that complete sustainable supply chain,” said Ed Schwarz, the head of marine solutions sales in North America for Siemens Energy, which has built electric propulsion systems for [U.S. ferries](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/sea-transport/new-york-first-hybrid-electric-ferry).

Electrification has only very recently come to America’s aquaculture sector. In Maine, the small but fast-growing segment includes nearly 
Still, electrifying commercial watercraft can be a difficult course to navigate, given the higher up-front costs of electric motors and the lack of charging infrastructure — and grid infrastructure in general — in rural waterfront communities.
Early adopters like Strater and Leathers said they hope the experiences gained from their demonstrations can help pave the way for decarbonizing Maine’s blue economy. With the help of the 
“People say it looks cool and shiny and looks like it operates great,” Lia Morris, the Island Institute’s senior community development officer, said of electric boats. “But we really want to be able to prove out the [business] case.”
Electric boats can cost between 20% and 30% more than a gas- or diesel-powered vessel of a comparable size. However, owners can save on maintenance and fuel over the long term, Strater’s business partner Nick Planson said.
“The high-level math that we’ve come up with” is a financial break-even point of “about four to five years, and then over a 10-year time span, you’re definitely coming out way ahead based on the vastly reduced maintenance cost, replacement cost of failed equipment, and fuel costs,” said Planson.
But the initial price tag presents a significant hurdle. Strater and Planson’s sleekly designed, no-frills watercraft cost $100,000 to build and outfit with a single electric outboard motor. Leathers’ boat, called Heron, cost about four times more. It has two electric outboards and a ramp for unloading and hauling more than 10,000 oysters at a time from the sea farm to distributors waiting on the dock. Its hull is also equipped with a small cabin and toilet.
Both operations relied on grant funding to defray the expense of going electric.
For their part, Strater and Planson used about $50,000 from a larger U.S. Department of Agriculture 2024 to establish a use case for electric workboats in the aquaculture industry. Leathers’ business, Maine Ocean Farms, was included on a collaborative $500,000 U.S. Department of Energy 289,000 for boat building and propulsion systems, in addition to other funds for charging infrastructure and data collection.

The prospects for funding future projects are now much murkier under the Trump administration, maritime policy experts say.
The DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which awarded the money to Maine Ocean Farms and its partners, is facing significant budget cuts in the next fiscal year. The GOP-backed spending law that passed in July rescinded some unobligated grant funding for cleaning up marine diesel engines. While other programs were spared, it’s unclear whether the current Congress will approve new funding for initiatives ranging from electrifying huge urban ports to deploying low-emissions ferries in rural communities.
But federal grants aren’t the only way to address the higher cost of electric boats. Strater and Planson also worked with Coastal Enterprises Inc., a Maine-based community development financial institution focused on climate resilience, to establish a “marine green” 
“The more electric engines that are being employed in Maine helps lift the whole tide for everyone,” said Nick Branchina, director of CEI’s fisheries and aquaculture program. As part of its marine green lending, CEI offers loans starting at $25,000 for small businesses to make the switch to electric propulsion and comfortably afford the cost of batteries or a shoreside charging installation.
Planson said that as electrification moves beyond initial grant-funded projects, the challenge is keeping systems affordable. He said he wants to see other small business owners able to “take a reasonable swing” at electric propulsion. 
Buying a boat, of course, is only the first obstacle. Electric vessel owners must also learn how to use their new propulsion systems and find a place to charge them.
This summer, Leathers said he’s had no trouble making the nearly two-mile round trip from the slip where he docks Heron in South Freeport, Maine, to his farm on Casco Bay. With a full charge, he can make trips slightly farther to meet distributors closer to Portland. But as temperatures drop this winter, Leathers said he’s not sure how far the outboards’ two batteries will take him. Cold weather can reduce battery capacity and impact performance, shrinking an electric motor’s range. It’s a part of Leathers’ demonstration to find out what the impacts are in practice.

Like Leathers, Strater and Planson also work year-round. They said they’re both impressed with how their boat performed last winter after launching in the fall of 2024. For Planson, who markets battery-powered equipment to aquaculture farmers as part of his startup, 
“The proof is in the pudding,” said Planson. “When you’re working with … waterfront applications, it really needs to work every day and all year.”
Strater and Planson said their boat’s range was an important consideration when they partnered with the startup Flux Marine to build the electric outboard motor. With limited shoreside charging infrastructure in place, the boat has to make it out and back on a single charge, sometimes to aquaculture operations seven miles away. In the 10 months since the boat’s launch, Strater has learned range correlates to speed. He can modulate the boat’s pace depending on how far he wants to go.
“We can go really fast for a short distance. We can go really slow for a long distance, and it works for what we do with it,” he said.
Soon, Maine’s early adopters will have shared access to a higher-capacity Level 2 charger that will be installed at the Sea Meadow Marine Foundation and can charge batteries in little over two hours, or three times faster than the current system. The startup DOE funding last year to install additional marine chargers there and at a wharf in Portland owned by the Gulf of Maine Research Institute. Island Institute also helped with grant funding for the charger at the Sea Meadow boatyard.

Maine will need much more high-capacity charging infrastructure for the marine industry to transition to electric propulsion, said the Island Institute’s Morris. As the state’s aquaculture and fisheries industries look to grow beyond small-scale operations, other businesses will need to charge more frequently to make longer, farther trips up and down the coast.
Expanding charging stations north of Casco Bay represents what Morris calls a “chicken and egg” problem: a dynamic where chargers are either installed before demand gets high, and sit unused, or electric boats hit the water and there’s not enough charging infrastructure, stalling future adoption.
This challenge is compounded by both New England’s aging grid infrastructure and the remote nature of some of the region’s waterfront access points. Getting the right amount of power to a charging station on the shore can be costly, even in Yarmouth, which sits on Casco Bay. Often it’s the last mile that can be the most expensive. At Sea Meadow Marine Foundation, three-phase power, which can accommodate higher loads, is limited by the dirt road that separates the boat launch from the more heavily trafficked U.S. Route 1.
“There are a lot of complicated questions,” Morris said. “I don’t think it’s unique to Maine, it’s any rural area, but complicated questions and conversations with the utilities and the rural municipalities are going to have to be solved for.”
Back on the water, Leathers docked his electric boat, Heron, alongside the sea farm’s barge, where thousands of oysters pass through for processing on harvest days. He switched the motor off and hopped onto the floating platform. For a moment, the bay was calm to the point of near silence. Then Leathers picked up an oyster cage with a rattle, turning it over in his hands as water splashed out. The sounds of the workday began.
“As a whole industry, I think it’s going to take proving that someone like us can do it,” Leathers said. “And then the next person kind of snowballing after that.”","Electrification, Food and farms, Marine transport, Northeast, Maine",electric-boats-rural-maine-oyster-seafood.md,articles_electrification

Takemura,"The GOP is eliminating tax credits that cut the costs of solar, EVs, heat pumps, and more — but if you act fast, you can still get discounts. Here’s how. 
_Canary Media’s “_[ _Electrified Life_](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/columns/electrified-life) _” column shares real-world tales, tips, and insights to demystify what individuals can do to shift their homes and lives to clean electric power._
Have you been sitting on the sidelines, waiting to decarbonize your home and commute?
It may be time to jump into action.
The “[Big, Beautiful Bill](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/trump-big-beautiful-bill-industry-impacts)” that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 sets early expiration dates for a slew of federal tax credits that have made it easier for millions of Americans to switch to clean and typically cheaper-to-run electric appliances and EVs, make efficiency upgrades to their homes, and put solar panels on their roofs. After the end of the year — [and even sooner for EVs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/buy-lease-ev-tax-credit) — none of those incentives will be available.
“We’re at a ‘use it or lose it’ point,” said Skip Wiltshire-Gordon, director of government affairs for policy strategy firm AnnDyl Policy Group. He’s encouraging people to start talking to contractors to figure out which upgrades make sense for them and to get on installers’ schedules.
Besides improving indoor air quality, switching to a heat pump lowers energy bills by hundreds of dollars for the majority of households, according to electrification nonprofit Rewiring America. Savings climb still higher by installing heat-pump water heaters and rooftop solar. These benefits are especially salient as utility bills rise nationwide, a trend that experts [expect the new law to exacerbate](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/big-beautiful-bill-state-costs).
In addition to the tax credits, households may also be able to access federal home-energy rebates, depending on their state; that Biden-era program was untouched by the new legislation.
Here’s a run-through of the federal incentives that are, for now, available to help you electrify your life.
## **Upgrade your home**
**The** 2,000 off your federal taxes for a qualifying [heat-pump heater/​air conditioner](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/a-beginners-guide-to-the-different-types-of-heat-pumps) or [heat-pump water heater](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/heat-pump-water-heater-sales-home-electrification), and separately, up to $1,200 on other energy-efficient upgrades, including [insulation and air-sealing materials](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-efficiency/weatherization-can-keep-you-cool-this-summer-and-warm-next-winter), windows, and exterior doors.

## **The home energy rebates that survived Trump’s megabill**
**The**[**$ 8.8 billion federal Home Energy Rebates program**](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/the-climate-laws-8-8b-in-home-energy-rebates-are-starting-to-roll-out) is targeted to low- and moderate-income families (earning less than 150% of the area median income) and comes in two flavors.
**The Home Electrification and Appliance Rebate ( HEAR) program** provides qualified households with 100% of costs are covered for households earning less than 80% of the area median income, and up to half of costs for those that make 80% to 150% of the area median income.
**The Home Efficiency Rebate ( HER) program, also known as HOMES,** can 8,000 for lower-income households — for whole-home efficiency projects that are modeled to reduce energy use by at least 35%. The rebates can be even larger for actually-measured savings. Unlike HEAR, all households are eligible.
States and territories administer their own instances of the programs, and details vary, including eligibility requirements. The programs are still coming online. So far, five states — HEAR and HOMES programs, making incentives available to residents, according to the Atlas Buildings Hub. Another seven states have launched just the HEAR program.
So check with your state energy office if home energy rebates are available or will be soon and how to qualify. In some cases,

https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/massachusetts-pilot-results-free-solar,Massachusetts test shows big savings from free heat pumps and solar,17 July 2025,Sarah Shemkus,"Low-income residents on Cape Cod and Martha’s Vineyard who participated in a home electrification pilot saw their utility bills drop by more than half.

A home electrification and solar pilot program for lower-income Cape Cod and Martha’s Vineyard residents is cutting participants’ energy bills nearly 60% and is expected to inform Massachusetts’ ongoing efforts to bring renewable energy and energy efficiency to all households.
“What the commonwealth has to have available, if we’re going to even hope to achieve our climate goals, is that there have to be options for people at every income level,” said Maggie Downey, chief administrative officer of the Cape Light Compact, the organization that administered the pilot.
The program, known as the Cape and Vineyard Electrification Offering, gave solar panels to all 55 participating households and heat pumps to 45 of those, most at no cost and some with a low co-payment, depending on income levels. Twelve households also received batteries, and some got electric dryers and stoves, to transition the homes completely off fossil fuels. Installations began in January 2024, and the final one [wrapped up](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/massachusetts-solar-heat-pump-battery-pilot) in May 2025.
The results: The average household is saving some $150 per month on energy costs and reducing net electricity use by 59% by getting much of its needed power from the on-site solar panels, according to an analysis published by the consultancy Guidehouse at the end of last month. Perhaps unsurprisingly, participating residents are quite satisfied with these outcomes, giving the program an exceptionally good “net promoter score” of 71%.
“My costs are drastically lower,” said Judy Welch, a homeowner in the Cape Cod town of Chatham who was one of the first folks to sign on for the upgrades. “In the summer now, I don’t have any bills, and I have the air conditioning on the whole time.” Her winter energy bills have also dropped to nearly zero thanks to the solar-powered heat pumps; previously, Welch paid around $500 a month to run electric baseboard heating.
Massachusetts has long had strong incentives for renewable energy and been a leader in policies promoting energy efficiency. The state has had less success, however, in helping lower-income households realize the benefits of these measures. At the same time, Massachusetts residents — especially those who make less money — face some of the highest energy burdens in the country. On Cape Cod, households making less than one-third of the area median income spent an average of 27% of their income on energy as of 2023, according to data from the U.S. Department of Energy. (An updated figure is unavailable because the federal tool that provided this data is no longer live.)
The Cape and Vineyard Electrification Offering was conceived of as a way to overcome the sometimes unmanageable up-front cost of efficiency and clean energy upgrades, and to amplify the impact of individual technologies by deploying them together. Solar panels would keep down the cost of operating heat pumps, and batteries would maximize the amount of zero-cost electricity available to each home.
“It’s all bundled for the participant in a way that makes sense and optimizes all these different systems and combines them through one program,” said Todd Olinsky-Paul, senior project director for the Clean Energy Group, a Vermont-based nonprofit that advocates for a just energy transition. “I haven’t seen that anywhere else.”
The pilot was designed and offered by the Cape Light Compact, a unique regional organization that negotiates electric supply prices and administers energy-efficiency programming for the 21 towns on Cape Cod and Martha’s Vineyard. The compact proposed versions of the pilot in 2018, 2020, and 2021, before the state [gave it the go-ahead](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/after-five-years-of-bureaucratic-limbo-cape-cod-clean-energy-program-finally-comes-to-fruition) in 2023.
The version that was finally approved called for 100 homes to participate in the pilot. As the effort rolled out, however, planners realized how challenging it is to deploy a standard package to houses with a wide range of ages and conditions. In some cases, interested homeowners decided against participation when they realized they would have to pay more than they hoped or discovered their yards were too shaded to generate much solar power. Some who did participate needed mold remediation or roof replacements; others were unable to receive batteries because they didn’t have basements.
“There is really no single solution for these questions,” Downey said. “It is so site-specific and customer-specific.”
Ultimately, 55 homes enrolled, as the unanticipated roadblocks raised the expected cost of serving each participant. On average, the Cape Light Compact spent about $45,700 on each heat pump installation, $30,000 on each solar installation, and $33,000 on each battery system, according to preliminary calculations.
These figures raised some questions at a recent meeting of the compact’s governing board, at which the Guidehouse report was presented. Downey acknowledged the cost, but pointed out that the need to transition off fossil fuels is inevitable — and comes with a price tag.
“You cannot hide the expense of what we have in front of us to deal with,” she told the board.
The report offers suggestions for improving any future iterations of the initiative. Pilot participants were prohibited from enrolling their solar systems in the state’s net-metering offering, and therefore their compensation for excess energy sent back into the grid was between 5 cents and 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, rather than at least 25 cents per kilowatt-hour. The evaluation suggests that future programs should allow the use of net metering to improve financial benefits even further. The report also suggests improving coordination among the various installers involved to make the process run more smoothly for participants.
The Cape Light Compact will present the results at the August meeting of the state Energy-Efficiency Advisory Council, the group responsible for writing Massachusetts’ triennial energy-efficiency plan. From there, the council will decide how to use the information to guide future equity-focused electrification efforts and determine the appropriate amount of financial support for households at different income levels.
“The results show that there are savings, and that energy burdens are reduced by more than 50%, when you pair it all with solar,” Downey said. “If we want to have low- to moderate-income customers come with us, we need to have options — that’s all part of the conversation.”","Electrification, Carbon-free buildings, Just transition, Northeast, Massachusetts",massachusetts-pilot-results-free-solar.md,articles_electrification

Time is running out for Americans to get a federally funded discount on energy upgrades that can lower their utility bills and make their homes healthier and more comfortable.
The GOP tax and spending law passed in July swiftly [phases out tax credits](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/use-tax-credits-evs-home-before-gone) that help households afford heat pumps and other energy-saving electric appliances. The credits were supposed to last about a decade; now they sunset Dec. 31.
To meet this use-it-or-lose-it moment, electrification advocacy nonprofit Rewiring America last week launched the 
“Most people don’t think about this stuff every day,” said Ari Matusiak, CEO of Rewiring America. “We’re talking about five or six purchasing decisions that you make only several times over in your whole life. … So making sure people have the resources and information available about [this] technology that is better and can save them money, is really important.”
The tax credits enable households to save thousands of dollars on their federal taxes when they invest in energy-slashing home upgrades, including electrical panel retrofits, [weatherization improvements](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-efficiency/weatherization-can-keep-you-cool-this-summer-and-warm-next-winter), and installations of [solar panels](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/guides-and-how-tos/ask-these-10-questions-if-you-want-to-get-rooftop-solar), [heat pump heater/​air conditioners](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/a-beginners-guide-to-the-different-types-of-heat-pumps), [home batteries](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/7-questions-to-ask-before-you-buy-a-home-battery), and [heat-pump water heaters](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/heat-pump-water-heaters-are-a-winner-for-the-climate-and-your-wallet).
Such measures are especially salient as households grapple with inflation, tariffs, and [rapidly rising electricity costs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/electricity-prices-rising-trump-impact). President Donald Trump promised to lower power bills, but experts expect his administration’s anti-renewables agenda [will keep them climbing](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/big-beautiful-bill-state-costs).
Efficiency upgrades also help put a dent in planet-warming pollution. 
With the long lead time often needed to get quotes and book contractors, households realistically need to decide if they’re going to pursue clean energy projects in the next several weeks to get the federal discounts, Matusiak said.
Accordingly, the campaign, which runs until the end of October, is a full-court press of resources and tailored support. Rewiring America is also coordinating with elected officials, manufacturers, utilities, and grassroots groups on the effort. Among those partners is the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of 24 governors, which last month committed to helping constituents 
“It’s really disheartening to see the federal government take away financial assistance from Americans at a time where they need it more than ever,” said Casey Katims, U.S. Climate Alliance executive director.

Overall, “the goal here is to create broad awareness for people to take advantage of incentives that are theirs to take,” Matusiak said.

A Boston suburb is proving them wrong.

A surge of housing development in a Boston suburb is providing evidence that natural-gas bans and strict energy-efficiency standards do not slow new construction or make it more expensive. Indeed, these guidelines can even boost the growth of affordable housing, say local advocates.
In 2024, Lexington, Massachusetts, banned gas hookups in new construction and [adopted a stringent building code](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/massachusetts-cities-embrace-voluntary-green-building-codes) that requires high energy-efficiency performance. Yet these regulations have not stopped the town of roughly 34,000 from permitting some 1,100 new units of housing — 160 of which will be affordable — over the past two years.
“Opponents said, ‘It’s going to cost so much, you’re going to stop the development of affordable housing.’ But that clearly wasn’t the case,” said Mark Sandeen, a member of the town select board and the board of the Lexington Affordable Housing Trust.
As Massachusetts aims to get to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, the state has for several years prioritized policies that encourage the transition away from fossil fuels, particularly natural gas, which heats about half of the state’s homes. In 2022, Massachusetts launched a pilot program allowing 10 communities — including Lexington — to prohibit the use of fossil fuels in new construction and major renovations. In late 2023, utilities regulators issued an order that makes explicit the state’s goal of getting off natural gas, and lays out strategies and principles for reaching this goal.
Detractors, however, have consistently argued that requiring or even heavily encouraging all-electric construction would make housing more costly and difficult to build at a time when Massachusetts is facing an acute housing shortage. In 2022, then-Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, memorably said the idea of fossil fuel bans gave him “agita,” so worried was he that such municipal regulations would suppress housing growth.
Similar battles have played out across the country, from [California](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-free-buildings/ca-ab-130-code-housing) to [New York](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-free-buildings/new-york-finalizes-gas-ban).
There is plenty of evidence that electrified, highly efficient homes don’t need to come with a price premium.
A 2022 study by think tank RMI found that, in Boston, [adopted lower wintertime rates](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/massachusetts-winter-electricity-discount) for homes with heat pumps. In 2023, Massachusetts-based advocacy group Built Environment Plus found that building larger multifamily and affordable housing developments “net-zero ready” — that is, highly efficient and with all-electric heating — 
## A sustainable housing surge in Lexington
After Lexington changed its zoning rules in 2023 to allow more multifamily development, its energy regulations did not, as naysayers had feared, deter developers from taking advantage. The planning board has approved nine projects, ranging from a proposal to redevelop an unused commercial space into a seven-unit building, to a complex combining 312 residential units with 2,100 square feet of retail space.
The new construction will include both rental units and condos available to purchase that will, in total, increase available housing in town by 9%. Much of the new housing will be market-rate, and Lexington — where the median condo went for $915,000 in the first quarter of 2025 — is not an inexpensive place to live.
However, most of the construction driven by the new zoning is required to make 15% of its units affordable. On top of these private projects, the town has decided to 40-unit affordable housing development, bringing the total number of affordable units on the horizon to about 200.
The municipal project will include four residential buildings designed to be energy-efficient and to minimize the square footage of halls and other common areas, which will reduce the cost of heating and cooling these spaces. Solar panels on the roofs will offset the electricity consumed by the building’s heat pumps, said Dave Traggorth, principal with Causeway Development, the company chosen to develop the property.
“Ultimately, what the tenant is paying for in their electric bill is really just cooking and lights,” he said. “It really reduces the utility bills for residents.”
All of these new projects — market-rate and affordable — will be prohibited from using fossil fuels to run furnaces or other appliances because of the town’s requirement that new construction be fully electric.
The town has also adopted an optional, more rigorous version of the state building code that requires new, multifamily projects over 12,000 square feet — which applies to most of those in the pipeline in Lexington — to build to passive house standards, which require a very well-sealed building envelope and dramatically reduced energy use compared to a conventionally built structures. “This is what you can do at the local level,” said Lisa Cunningham, cofounder of climate advocacy organization ZeroCarbonMA.
While Lexington is a particularly active town, the other nine communities that have banned fossil fuels in new construction have all reported that the rules have posed no obstacle to development, Cunningham said. Restrictive zoning and antidevelopment sentiment among residents are much more pressing problems, she said.
For the eventual residents, the benefits go beyond the knowledge that their homes are helping cut emissions. Homes designed to passive house standards use far less energy than those that are conventionally built, creating ongoing savings for homeowners and tenants, and have been found to generally have better indoor air quality. When the power goes out, these well-sealed buildings can keep interior temperatures comfortable for days.
## Paving the way for electrification
It is no accident that residential developers were ready to jump when opportunities opened up in a town with stringent efficiency and electrification rules. Massachusetts has been laying the groundwork for years, said Lauren Baumann, director of sustainability and climate initiatives for the Massachusetts Housing Partnership, a nonprofit that works to expand affordable housing.
“There has been this deliberate effort to develop an ecosystem to support this kind of construction,” she said.
In 2019, the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center [awarded $1.73 million in grants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/massachusetts-grants-test-potential-of-passive-design-for-multifamily-homes) to eight affordable, multifamily projects to help accelerate the adoption of passive house standards in multifamily construction by demonstrating that the approach makes financial sense. That same year, the state’s energy-efficiency program administrator, Mass Save, launched an initiative offering money to multifamily projects for feasibility studies, energy modeling, and analyses of post-construction energy performance.
These incentives gave architects and contractors a lower-risk way to become familiar with a new approach to building. And familiarity, in this case, bred knowledge, skills, and enthusiasm.
“Those early project pilots really did give people the experience they needed in order to feel comfortable,” Baumann said. “We just saw an explosion of interest.”
Traggorth has seen this evolution in his work. Five years ago, he said, if he approached a contractor to discuss building to passive house standards, he was often greeted with confusion. Now, “every contractor that’s building multifamily has a couple of projects that have been passive house certified,” he said. “They have learned their lessons.”","Electrification, Carbon-free buildings, Energy efficiency, Northeast, Massachusetts",massachusetts-gas-ban-housing-impact.md,articles_electrification
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/electric-coffee-roasting-minnesota,Meet Minnesota’s electric coffee roasting pioneers,5 August 2025,Dan Haugen,"Minneapolis-based Coffeewomple is one of the first U.S. roasters to use a commercial-scale electric coffee roaster, navigating higher costs for climate benefits.

Some people had sourdough to help get them through the pandemic.
Zach Whitney had coffee beans.
The former barista began experimenting during the COVID-19 lockdown with a small, electric coffee roaster, seeing what flavors he could coax from tiny batches of fresh beans in his suburban Minneapolis kitchen.
“Unlike homebrew [beer], people wanted my coffee,” Whitney quipped about the early results he shared with friends.
Small electric appliances have long been an entry point for at-home coffee roasting, which like other craft hobbies saw an uptick during the pandemic. Almost all commercial roasting today, however, happens in gas-powered machines, which tend to come with more scale and precision — and greenhouse gas emissions — compared to electric options.
A trend toward electric coffee roasting has been percolating for years, though, and COVID-era coffee tinkerers like Whitney are helping to pique interest in electric roasting technology. Manufacturers are betting on an electric future, too, rolling out larger and smarter electric roasting machines aimed at competing with gas on quality and convenience, as well as providing climate benefits.
As Whitney’s hobby grew into a side business, he and his partner Nicole Bolea were determined to minimize their climate impact and saw electrification as the best way to do that. “We’ve always roasted on electric, and that’s always been a part of our focus,” Whitney said.
They founded 2022, roasting small batches of beans at home to sell at farmers markets. They soon outgrew their tiny countertop setup — which allowed them to roast roughly two 1-pound bags of coffee per batch — and they spent months searching for a commercial-scale upgrade that would get them closer to 30 bags per batch. The problem: Most electric roasters were not even half that size.
At one point Bolea, a chemical engineer by trade, began to seriously explore a system for capturing carbon emissions if they had to resort to a gas roaster in order to grow the business. Then, after a flurry of searches and cold emails, Coffeewomple connected with a Dutch manufacturer called Giesen Roasting Solutions, which had just announced the largest commercially available electric coffee roaster.
“I was getting frustrated that we couldn’t find anything, and so I was just Googling and then bugged them,” Bolea said.
Giesen planned to showcase its 2024 Specialty Coffee Expo in Chicago. A few months before the event, Bolea and Whitney signed a deal to buy the machine after it was displayed at the expo, saving some on shipping costs and significantly shrinking the typical lead time to receive a new commercial roaster.
It wasn’t a financial decision. They estimated the electric roaster cost 20% to 30% more than a similar gas version would have — “significant but not prohibitive of making the numbers work in our business,” Bolea said — while their electric bills have been higher than what they would likely have paid for gas.
Another challenge was finding physical space to rent in their price range with enough electric capacity to power the machine, which requires an alternating current of 400 volts. (Whitney, a building electrical designer by trade, had to come up with a system to run the European machine on U.S. voltage.) They eventually found a location in a former Ry-Krisp factory in Southeast Minneapolis.
The roasting process itself has been almost identical to gas, Whitney said, and despite the added costs and hurdles, the couple has no regrets about going electric for the environmental benefits.
A comprehensive number for coffee industry emissions is hard to come by, but studies have found most of its climate impact comes from planting, harvesting, and on-farm processing. The roasting step likely accounts for somewhere between 5% and 15% of the beverage’s emissions profile (and much less if you include milk).
Coffeewomple was the first U.S. customer for Giesen’s large electric roaster — which can churn out about 33 pounds of coffee per batch — but the manufacturer has since sold a handful more here, according to sales manager Joost van Buitenen. The feedback so far has been positive, he said. “Especially here in Europe, and also in the U.S., I see more and more inquiries for electric roasters, so I think it will be the future,” van Buitenen said.
He attributed much of the demand to places where access to natural gas is limited, either by infrastructure or policy, as well as areas where government incentives exist to switch to electric equipment.
Giesen isn’t the only company betting on an electric coffee roasting future. Berkeley, California-based Bellwether Coffee has drawn attention from 
Mill City Roasters in Minneapolis manufactures and sells small electric coffee roasters and also teaches classes on the roasting process. Owner Steve Green is skeptical about building a business around existing electric roasting technologies, but he’s seen enough interest from customers that he is working with an engineer to design a larger, higher-performing electric roaster.
“All coffee roasters will eventually turn beans brown, but the challenge is to build a system that is precisely controllable enough to get something better out of the machine,” Green said.
“The big challenge is that coffee changes the way it takes heat all throughout the roast,” he said. There are points in the process where you need to quickly dial heat up or down. “You can do that with electricity, but you can’t do it as well as you can with gas. You really have to think a minute or a minute and a half ahead, as opposed to a gas system, where you are probably thinking 15 to 30 seconds ahead. It’s not impossible.”
Van Buitenen, of Giesen, compared the differences to those between electric and gasoline-fueled vehicles. They may handle differently, but that doesn’t mean one type is inferior to the other.
The move toward electric coffee roasting is part of a broader push to reduce emissions from food and beverage processing and manufacturing, the fourth largest source of U.S. industrial heat emissions following refineries, chemicals, and iron and steel, according to 
“The technology is often quite mature, but it’s taking that technology and outfitting it for a particular facility or operation that takes some level of ingenuity,” said Brandon Isakson, managing director for industry at the St. Paul, Minnesota-based clean energy nonprofit Fresh Energy.
In a state like Minnesota, where natural gas remains relatively cheap, many of the conversions to electric process heat are driven by concerns about climate change, but state incentives are also helping to move the needle. Isakson pointed to a 60 million for industrial innovation that reduces emissions.
At their roasting facility in Southeast Minneapolis, Whitney and Bolea continue to look for ways to reduce their environmental impact while expanding their reach. They pay a premium for compostable packaging and use reusable buckets for larger customers.
“We’re both very passionate about the environment,” Bolea said, “and so doing it in a more sustainable way has always been at the core.”","Electrification, Food and farms, Fun stuff, Midwest, Minnesota",electric-coffee-roasting-minnesota.md,articles_electrification
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/texas-whisper-valley-neighborhood-homes,Geothermal energy keeps utility bills low in this Texas neighborhood,27 June 2025,Terry L. Jones,"The development outside Austin taps into natural heat deep underground to run heating and cooling systems for the planned 7,500 homes and other buildings.

Whisper Valley is a peek into what the future could look like.
The sweeping community in the Austin, Texas, suburb of Manor is filled with modern homes, small manicured lawns, quiet streets, and rooftops outfitted with solar panels. Hidden beneath it is a network of pipes and man-made reservoirs that heat and cool hundreds of households via geothermal technology — a source that currently provides less than 1% of the U.S. electrical demand.
When completed, Whisper Valley will consist of approximately 7,500 owner-occupied and rental homes and multifamily units ranging in price from $350,000 to $750,000; three schools; 2 million square feet of commercial space; and 700 acres of park and outdoor community spaces. Habitat for Humanity is set to build affordable housing, which will hook up to the geothermal network.
Zac Turov, business development manager for EcoSmart Solutions, which runs the community’s geothermal system, says savings on utility bills for residents here with geothermal-powered heat pumps that cool and heat buildings can run up to $2,000 a year — based on a third-party-verified Home Energy Rating System.

Michael Wilt has lived in the community for six years, moving into his three-bedroom, 1,800-square-foot house during the first phase of Whisper Valley’s development.
He says he’s never had utility costs higher than $70 during the summer months or $45 a month during the winter. That doesn’t count the $60 monthly fee he pays to EcoSmart in operation fees.
“It absolutely works better than the HVAC system I had in the house that I was renting before purchasing the house,” Wilt, 47, said.
“The geothermal system was definitely part of the appeal, but really it was kind of the entire ‘agrihood’ feeling of the whole development,” he added, referring to places that are “intentional” about incorporating green infrastructure into the neighborhood and individual homes.
Developer Michael Thurman has built 30 of the more than 600 homes in this massive mixed-use development. And his company, Thurman Homes, is set to build up to 50 more.
The developer calls geothermal a commonsense way to preserve the planet by cutting the use of fossil fuels to power the homes and businesses here. Heating, cooling, and providing electricity to residential and commercial buildings accounts for about 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
The community sits 15 miles northeast of Austin. It’s an area home to multiple tech companies, including Google, Tesla, Dell, Samsung, and Applied Materials.
But not all of the developers building in Whisper Valley tap into its geothermal system.
The reason, said Thurman, is money. It costs approximately $40,000 per home to install the heat pumps and hook up to the geothermal network.

“We can’t keep doing the same things,” Thurman said, referring to the imperative to cut greenhouse gas emissions. “This isn’t tough to do, but you have to have core values that make you want to do it.”
Geothermal is more expensive than other forms of renewable energy, 
“The goal is for all the developers who build here to use geothermal,” Turov said. “But it’s still a tough sale.”
This is the high end of the estimated cost of various forms of energy generation in the United States. (
## **Geothermal possible “almost anywhere”**
Drilling advancements have expanded how and where geothermal technology can be used for heating and cooling individual buildings — and broader power generation.
“The thing is: It is hot everywhere underground,” said Drew Nelson, vice president of programs, policy, and strategy at the Houston-based, geothermal-focused nonprofit Project Innerspace. “Today, with the advances in modern drilling, we are now able to tap into that heat almost anywhere.”
The International Energy Agency (IEA) 140 times over. And Nelson says the United States has the most potential to be a leader in the industry, with countries including China and India also having the resources to generate geothermal power.
“As more projects are implemented, costs will continue to come down,” Nelson said, noting the IEA analysis also predicts geothermal in coming years will be “competitive with solar and wind paired with battery storage.”

## **Geothermal: old technology with new interest**
Using underground water reservoirs for heating and cooling or to generate electricity isn’t new. But until recently it was mostly confined to specific regions where it was easier to drill into hot water reservoirs — like in Iceland or California.
As of 2021, geothermal was concentrated in Western states, with California and Nevada accounting for more than 90% of the country’s geothermal power production, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
Geothermal is one of the cleanest ways to produce electricity. And it is the only renewable energy technology that has largely stayed out of the crosshairs of President Donald Trump, who has slashed federal support for renewable and clean energy, including wind and solar.
“One of the reasons President Trump really likes geothermal right now is that it’s all American,” said Bryant Jones, executive director of Geothermal Rising, a California-based nonprofit that advocates for the industry internationally. “It’s local. It’s a way to help rural America figure out their own economies as they transition from one technology to another.”

However, industry insiders are ringing the alarms and pressuring the U.S. Congress to not eliminate clean energy tax credits and incentives included in former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. If those tax credits are phased out, insiders say it would cripple the industry before it has a chance to get on its feet.
While billions in federal funding for wind, solar, and other clean energy technology are on the chopping block, the budget bill mulled by Senate Republicans currently would 2033.
The U.S. Department of Energy did not respond to multiple requests for comment on whether it would continue to support geothermal through federal funding and tax incentives, as it did under the previous administration.
“We do need the tax credits for geothermal energy to be maintained,” Jones said. “Geothermal doesn’t have a technology problem, it has a policy problem. [It’s] been around for over 100 years, [but] it hasn’t had the policy support the way the oil and gas industry has, or the nuclear industry, and most recently, the solar and wind industry.”
## **People “obsessed” with geothermal**
Traditionally, geothermal was limited to places with naturally occurring underground hot reservoirs, usually near tectonic plates or in volcanic areas.
But evolutions in geothermal have opened the door for developers to utilize oil and gas drilling technologies which help lower costs and allow them to create their own reservoirs almost anywhere. The models fall in two categories: enhanced geothermal systems, or EGS, and closed-loop geothermal systems like the one in Whisper Valley.
With EGS systems, developers create artificial underground reservoirs through hydraulic fracturing or “fracking,” and then inject water or other fluids into a well. The water is heated as it moves through hot rocks and is then pumped up into a separate production well to generate energy.
Closed-loop systems use an underground network of sealed wells where water or fluid is pumped and heated without ever coming in direct contact with rocks. It is then piped into the homes and buildings connected to the system. These systems also cool buildings by drawing out heat during warm weather.
“The more that people learn about geothermal,” Jones said, “the more obsessed they become.”
He says geothermal’s appeal includes a low carbon footprint, reliability, and established drilling technology pioneered by the oil and gas industry. Unlike batteries and wind power, geothermal does not rely on 
It’s also among the more expensive energy sources because it requires specialized drilling, installation equipment, and skilled workers trained to build it all. Supporters say the industry will continue to need federal tax credits and funding to grow, especially in communities where utility bills are already unaffordable.
While many geothermal units serve just a single household, systems that serve many buildings are more affordable.
“A way to address that is through thermal energy networks, or geothermal district networks,” Jones said, referring to connecting multiple homes and buildings, which means “the cost goes down for everybody.“
He cites Framingham, Massachusetts, where one utility, Eversource, is providing geothermal energy 
“We are still collecting data as we enter the start of the cooling season, but over the winter we saw strong system performance even during the January and February cold snaps,” said Olessa Stepanova, spokesperson for Eversource.
Stepanova says the company expects to have insight into energy savings from the project within a year from when each customer is connected to the geothermal system. And the utility is in final negotiations with the DOE and state to expand the network.
“This would not only demonstrate the scalability of networked geothermal systems,” she added, “but also how they become more cost-effective as they are expanded.”

## **Federal funding sparks geothermal development**
Last year, the U.S. Department of Energy Geothermal Technologies Office 37.7 million to five cities to install district-scale geothermal heating and cooling systems.
Ann Arbor, Michigan, was awarded the most money, $10 million, which the city is using to build and operate a community geothermal system. It is projected to provide heating and cooling to 262 homes, a local elementary school, and community center in the Bryant neighborhood. The predominantly minority, lower-income area seeks to become the most 
“It’s a neighborhood that has been disinvested in, and as we were working on our climate goals to be carbon neutral, we wanted to do that in a just and equitable way,” said Missy Stults, director of the city’s Office of Sustainability and Innovations.
Stults says some households in the community shell out up to 30% of their income on utility bills.
“We started to think about what’s a sustainable source of heating that we could look at that helps maintain affordability for everyone [and] that’s clean,” Stults said. “And so geothermal was one thing that came up, and the residents were really interested in it.”
Stults says it’ll likely be a year before the city starts drilling — and that’s only if Congress or the Trump administration keeps the federal funding in place. The city has been “sort of treading water” since Trump announced freezes on various renewable energy program spending. As of June, Stults says the grant had not been terminated, but the funding still hadn’t been allocated to move their project forward.
“Our hope is that [the project] will align with the administration’s goals,” she said. “This is American-made energy. It’s our grounds, our soil. It’s pretty powerful.”

## **Support for geothermal growing in Texas**
As a selling point, Thurman uses the utility bills for his model home in Whisper Valley and compares them with other homes of the same size he built with traditional HVAC systems.
For the three-bedroom,1,800-square-foot home he built in Whisper Valley, utility bills in June and August 2023 were $42.16 and $74.54, respectively. A home the same size he built using an HVAC system had bills in those same two months of $233 and $326, respectively.
Turov says some developers have opted to build homes in Whisper Valley that use traditional HVAC systems instead of geothermal.

“Developers are reluctant to innovate, usually because it costs more, even though there are great benefits from using the technology,” he said. “We might have to make it work without [federal] subsidies, which will be a challenge but could be good for the long-term viability of the technology in the United States.”
EcoSmart Solutions successfully lobbied Texas state lawmakers for changes in state law and “special purpose” taxing districts.
Turov explains that such districts allow developers to install infrastructure such as lights, roads, and water systems, the cost of which is then repaid by owners on their property tax bills.
“I think right now, we’re in the first adopter stage,” Turov said. “And that’ll probably still be the case for the next few years. And then I think more and more people will adopt it.”

Teaming up with Ormat accelerates Sage’s timeline to build its first commercial power-generation facility by about two years. It’s now targeting to bring the plant online by late 2026 or early 2027, said Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage.
“For us, the ability to scale faster with Ormat is huge,” Taff told Canary Media. “But it’s also a great opportunity for Ormat to reach a deeper [geothermal] resource than what they’re targeting now.”
Geothermal energy represents only about 0.4% of total U.S. electricity generation — largely because existing technology is constrained by geography. Today’s geothermal plants rely on naturally occurring reservoirs of hot water and steam, found only in places like Northern California and Nevada, to spin their turbines and generate power.
Technological advances are making it possible to deploy geothermal in less obvious areas, breathing fresh life into the decades-old industry. In recent years, the carbon-free energy source has seen a [surge of investment and bipartisan policy support](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/was-2024-a-breakout-year-for-next-generation-geothermal-energy) amid soaring demand for electricity from data centers, factories, and electric vehicles.

“Geothermal has always enjoyed support from both sides of the aisle,” said Taff, who was previously a vice president at fossil fuel company Shell. “But now there’s a lot of momentum for the industry.”
## **Fracking rocks to harness heat**
Sage’s approach to geothermal energy involves tapping into both heat and pressure from hot, dry rocks found deep underground. To start, the company drills wells and fractures rocks to create artificial reservoirs that it pumps full of water. Sage cycles the water in and out of the fracture — like inflating and deflating a balloon — and can jettison the liquid to the surface to drive turbines and produce electricity.
The startup’s partnership with Reno, Nevada-based Ormat will allow Sage to access land and power-plant equipment and to connect to the grid far more quickly than if the startup set up a new site on its own. The companies are looking to install the next-generation system at a facility where Ormat’s older conventional wells are declining in capacity.
“In general, plants may operate below capacity due to a combination of factors, such as changes in the geothermal resource over time,” said Smadar Lavi, Ormat’s vice president and head of investor relations and ESG planning and reporting. “These sites are well-suited for piloting Sage’s technology, as it offers the potential to unlock additional production from existing assets.”
Terra Rogers of the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force said that Ormat’s decision to expand beyond its traditional hydrothermal resources and into next-generation tech represents “an important step, and we’ve all been waiting for it.” Rogers, who leads the advocacy group’s [superhot rock](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/magma-and-hot-rocks-iceland-seeks-the-future-of-geothermal-energy) geothermal program, called Ormat the “grandparents of geothermal,” given that the company has been around for 60 years and operates more than 190 geothermal plants globally.
As part of the agreement, Ormat can license Sage’s technologies for power generation as well as energy storage. The startup uses a similar setup to store excess grid energy. But instead of drilling deep into high-temperature rocks, Sage pumps water into shallower formations that aren’t as hot, since heat isn’t needed for storage. Pressure builds up underground and can be released later, when power demand spikes, to spin a pinwheel-like 
“The idea that [Ormat] chose Sage specifically, with their storage technology, is also very telling for the needs of the grid in the West,” Rogers said, adding that it “complements existing or intermittent forms of renewables” like wind and solar.
Sage recently finished building its first commercial storage project on the site of a coal plant owned by San Miguel Electric Cooperative in Christine, Texas. The facility, which is expected to connect to the Texas grid in December, will be able to discharge 3 MW for four to six hours at a time, according to Taff.

The startup plans to perform a demonstration of its electricity-generating tech in the first quarter of 2026 in Starr County, Texas, in partnership with the U.S. Air Force. Sage is also evaluating potential sites east of the Rocky Mountains to develop its 150-MW project with Meta.
Fervo, meanwhile, continues drilling away at its Cape Station project in Beaver County, Utah, which has been under construction for almost two years.
The eight-year-old company said an initial 100-MW installation is poised to start delivering power to the grid in 2026. An additional 400 MW is slated to come online in 2028, a portion of which will use the new equipment from Baker Hughes. The startup’s recent supply deal comes just months after Fervo said it secured 
“Fervo designed Cape Station to be a flagship development that’s scalable, repeatable, and a proof point that geothermal is ready to become a major source of reliable, carbon-free power in the U.S.,” Tim Latimer, Fervo’s CEO and cofounder, said in a Sept. 2 statement.","Geothermal, Clean energy",fervo-sage-partner-large-companies-tech.md,articles_geothermal

Geothermal advocates celebrated the outcome for their industry, which they say will be vital to scaling the resource in the United States to meet the nation’s soaring power demand. The sector has [attracted a lot of attention](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/was-2024-a-breakout-year-for-next-generation-geothermal-energy) in recent years because it can provide carbon-free power around the clock — something solar and wind can’t do — and technological advances are making it possible to deploy geothermal in places that conventional plants can’t go.
This “policy milestone highlights the geothermal industry’s role in fortifying grid resilience and national security,” Vanessa Robertson, director of policy and education for Geothermal Rising, an industry association, said in a statement. “With certainty in place, we look forward to seeing projects advance and innovative partnerships flourish.”
Still, the industry isn’t immune to the broader market challenges created by Trump’s policies, despite its more favorable treatment from Congress.
New tariffs on things like steel and aluminum have [increasing the risk for investors](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/china-foreign-entity-rules-trump) who finance clean energy projects.
“We’re making an ugly layered cake of barriers to quick and clean project development,” said Advait Arun, a senior associate for energy finance at the Center for Public Enterprise, a nonprofit think tank.
## **On the cusp of scaling “enhanced” geothermal**
Geothermal plants, which [harness Earth’s heat](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/geothermal-is-the-hottest-thing-in-clean-energy-heres-why) to generate power, have for decades represented less than 1% of the U.S. electricity mix. That’s because conventional plants tend to be viable only when located near natural formations like hot springs, where the heat is easier to reach, but which only occur in a handful of places in the United States.
New tools and techniques are emerging that make it possible to put geothermal plants in more parts of the country.
The startup Fervo Energy completed America’s first “2023 — a [3.5-megawatt pilot plant](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/americas-first-enhanced-geothermal-plant-just-got-up-and-running) in Nevada backed by Google. Now, the Houston-based company is building the world’s first large-scale enhanced geothermal plant in Utah’s high desert. Fervo has raised 500-megawatt Cape Station, with the first 100 MW slated to start delivering power to the grid in 2026.
In June, the startup XGS Energy announced 150-MW next-generation geothermal project in New Mexico by 2030 to support Meta’s data center operations. Meta, which owns Facebook and WhatsApp, [signed a similar agreement](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/sage-geosystems-and-meta-sign-150mw-geothermal-power-agreement) last year with Sage Geosystems to build 150 MW of geothermal power at an unspecified site east of the Rocky Mountains. The first phase of that project is set to come online in 2027.
Geothermal has long drawn bipartisan support and has so far dodged Trump’s broader attacks on renewable energy. It helps that the new geothermal wave has considerable overlap with the oil and gas industry, sharing the same drilling equipment, workforce, and investors. U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, previously the CEO of a fracking company that invested in Fervo, 
Under the new law, geothermal and other baseload clean power sources investment tax credit or the production tax credit if they begin construction by 2033, after which point the credits will gradually decrease to zero in 2036. The concrete phase-out schedule differs from the IRA, which allowed more flexibility and could’ve kept the incentives in place for several more years, according to Geothermal Rising.
Wind and solar facilities, meanwhile, must either start operating before the end of 2027 or begin construction by next summer to obtain credits. [Geothermal heat pumps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/geothermal-heat-pumps-are-crazy-efficient-should-you-get-one), which heat and cool buildings, will lose access to residential tax credits after 2025.
For next-generation geothermal firms, the tax incentives are crucial to getting the first slate of projects up and running. Developers use the promise of future tax credits as collateral to raise the many millions in financing they need to explore suitable project sites and deploy novel drilling technologies. The credits also help to attract major customers, including tech giants that are looking for a variety of baseload power sources to run their sprawling data centers.
“They help the market to develop,” said Mehdi Yusifov, the director of data centers and AI at Project InnerSpace, a geothermal advocacy group. “Tax credits of this kind can … help get infrastructure built on a mega scale.”
Yusifov and Nico Enriquez, a principal at Future Ventures, studied the potential cost of serving a “hyperscale” data center with power from a 1-gigawatt enhanced geothermal project in a place like the Western U.S. In a 119 per megawatt-hour without the investment tax credit — significantly better than estimated costs for nuclear power. With the tax credit, the hypothetical geothermal system could achieve $88 per megawatt-hour, which is competitive with the upper range for a fossil-gas power plant.
“It seems like there’s a dam that would break if it could be proven that [geothermal] can produce power anywhere in the range below Three Mile Island,” said Enriquez, referring to the shuttered nuclear plant in Pennsylvania that is [expected to restart](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear/nuclear-power-had-a-strong-year-in-2024-but-uncertainty-looms-for-2025) to serve Microsoft’s growing energy appetite.
“That’s another reason why this investment tax credit is so important, because it makes it possible to have the dam break,” he added. “And suddenly you can flood the market with these projects that are giving us critical infrastructure.”
It’s unclear whether the budget bill will undermine some next-generation projects due to the anti-China provisions attached to these key incentives. The rules, known as “foreign entity of concern” restrictions, will require companies to scrutinize their supply chains to an unprecedented degree, with potentially onerous and costly legal implications that make it harder for projects to claim incentives.
“It remains to be seen how developers of these really innovative technologies can navigate this, because it’s not going to be the easiest process from here on out,” said Arun of the Center for Public Enterprise.
Even as the headwinds swirl, geothermal developers continue to make significant strides to improve their technologies. Both Fervo and the federal Utah Forge initiative have said they’ve dramatically 
“There’s an amount we save long-term if we invest upfront in these tax credits, because of the learning curve,” he said. “If we can maintain [the momentum] for the next five years, I think this industry will be one of the key power sources for the U.S.”","Geothermal, Clean energy, Climatetech finance, Policy regulation",enhanced-trump-bill-tax-credits.md,articles_geothermal

Mendocino County sits on a prime geothermal zone. As the industry grows, local leaders are ramping up efforts to prep residents for the jobs it creates.

_**Powering Rural Futures:** Clean energy is creating new jobs in rural America, generating opportunities for people who install solar panels, build wind turbines, weatherize homes, and more. [This five-part series](https://www.canarymedia.com/rural) from the Rural News Network explores how industry, state governments, and education systems are training this growing workforce._
A plan to nearly double the amount of electricity drawn from naturally occurring heat deep below Mendocino and Sonoma counties could create thousands of new jobs in the region.
The Sonoma-Mendocino GeoZone project still faces a long list of legal, regulatory, and financial hurdles before construction, but the developer is already thinking ahead to hiring.
Sonoma Clean Power CEO Geof Syphers said the not-for-profit power producer is committed to hiring local workers for at least 30% of the jobs it creates. Meeting that goal, he said, will depend on building partnerships with local education and workforce development programs, along with a long-term commitment from California to streamline geothermal energy.
“We’ve been building partnerships with schools and trades and landowners and public officials, permitting agencies,” Syphers said. “But what really needs to happen before the permitting phase begins is we have to change state laws.”
Clean energy makes up a small but growing slice of Mendocino County’s employment, accounting for just under 600 jobs in 2023, according to an analysis of federal data by the nonprofit Environmental Entrepreneurs, which advocates for state and local policies benefiting the environment and economic interests.
Mendocino County workforce and education officials are taking note, gradually ramping up programs to train students to weatherize buildings, install and maintain solar projects, and take on other related construction roles.
Noel Woodhouse, an instructor who runs Mendocino College’s sustainable construction and energy technology program, said the program has already evolved since launching in 2011 and will continue to do so. He’s confident that his students’ skills in cleantech, solar, and sustainable building would easily transfer to geothermal construction — especially since the non-credit certificate program could rapidly train a large number of students in a short time.
“Our students come out of our program with experience in heavy equipment machinery and ready workers for that type of project,” Woodhouse said.

Clean energy jobs pull in a wide range of professional skills, from plumbing and electrical work to pouring concrete and operating equipment. 
“What I love is the people who work in oil and gas know exactly how to operate 100% of the equipment on a geothermal job site, and it’s the same wages,” Syphers said.
Geothermal energy is harnessed by drilling deep below the earth’s surface to access naturally occurring heat. The steam flows to a turbine to drive a generator that in turn produces electricity — a process that can occur 24 hours a day.
Mendocino County, along with neighboring Sonoma and Lake counties, sits on one of the country’s prime geothermal zones. The world’s largest complex of commercial geothermal power plants, known as The Geysers, is located in the Mayacamas Mountains near where the three counties connect. Owning the majority of the units there, Calpine Corporation generates about 725 megawatts of electricity using geothermal energy. Sonoma Clean Power’s GeoZone proposal aims to build another 600 megawatt geothermal power plant.
A steam line runs down to a generating unit at The Geysers along the border of Sonoma and Lake counties. Calpine Corporation, the largest geothermal power producer in the U.S., owns and operates 13 power plants at The Geysers, the largest complex of geothermal power plants in the world, with a net generating capacity of about 725 megawatts of electricity — enough to power 725,000 homes, or a city the size of San Francisco. (U.S. Department of Energy via Bay City News)
The labor needed to develop 600 megawatts of new geothermal energy capacity will require hundreds of white-collar workers and thousands of construction workers during the building phase, and the project will create about 1,000 permanent jobs, Syphers said.
“Today, about 400 people from Sonoma, Lake, and Mendocino work at The Geysers,” Syphers said. “If we can roughly double that for permanent jobs, that’s very exciting to me.”
## **Connecting students to skills and employers**
As director of employer partnerships for Mendocino College, Pamela Heston-Bechtol’s job is making connections between students and employers. She combs through job postings at least once or twice a week and distributes opportunities to respective departments.
“It’s giving our students as much exposure as possible to be able to see themselves in those jobs by inviting industry to our advisory committees and inviting our students to job shadowing,” Heston-Bechtol said.
The Mendocino County Office of Education also offers career technical education programs with various pathways for youth. Eric Crawford, the office’s director of career and college programs, and Natalie Spackman, a workforce development coordinator with North Bay Construction Corps, together work with high school seniors interested in construction trades to complete a 14-week program.
“At the end of the instruction, they get a tool belt, and then they go out for boot camp for two weeks, and they work with contractors for 80 hours on a live build site and find out what it’s really like to do the work,” Crawford said, noting that this helps students determine which type of work interests them most.
At the completion of camp, the contractors are invited to interview students and potentially offer them jobs.

The newest career technical education program set for Ukiah High School, called Roots of Success, will train high school students specifically for green energy fields. However, Spackman said that basic training in construction gives students skills that transfer to a variety of work, especially given the state’s regulations for the trades to go green.
“No matter where they go, contractors ultimately work for their customers — what’s in demand?” she said. “The skills that they’re learning, that’s going to translate.”
Leaders from both the high school and college workforce development programs agree that while there’s plenty of work for their students and a growing demand for clean energy workers, trades training is hindered by a severe shortage of teachers.
Crawford said anyone with three years of experience in a specific field can get a designated subject teaching credential and become qualified by the state of California. Woodhouse said that Mendocino College’s minimum qualifications include an associate degree and experience in the field.
Other challenges, Woodhouse said, are those stacked against the students in a county with high rates of substance abuse and poverty. To address those, he highlighted support systems at the college that include a food pantry, mental health services, and transportation, among others.
## **A student perspective**

Kevin Vasquez says participating in the Mendocino College program changed the course of his life.
When he was 11 years old, Vasquez received a message at school that his father wouldn’t be able to pick him up. He had been deported.
“I felt violated that they took my dad from me,” he said. “I started drinking alcohol, trying to escape.”
The quiet habit morphed into an addiction that left him aimless and jobless in his 20s. Yet he remembered his father, an immigrant from Mexico who had worked tirelessly in stone masonry to give him a better life. He knew he needed to make something of that life, but he needed help first.
He went through rehabilitation, where a counselor suggested he check out Mendocino College’s construction program. For Vasquez, that program sparked light in the darkness.
“It got me back out there, doing what I love, which is building with my hands,” said Vasquez, who now offers help to other students as a lab tech. 
For Vasquez, the prospect of GeoZone tapping into more renewable energy within the county brings an exciting opportunity to put his skills to use at a potential union job.

Mendocino County’s hiring contractors are small, and while they offer great one-on-one experiences, Woodhouse said, they’re not unionized.
Syphers shared that Mendocino County workers won’t need to be union members to work on the GeoZone project.
“You don’t have to be a union signatory to get hired through a union and then work on these projects,” he said. “That gives you an option to decide later if you want to become a signatory and be part of the union.”
The construction phase for GeoZone is projected to be six or seven years out, but Syphers said those years will be spent cultivating relationships with local schools, unions, and smaller contractors.
Ultimately, he hopes the state will streamline permitting and make long-term commitments to invest in geothermal work. 
“That’s how we actually get unions to open apprenticeship centers in Mendocino County,” Syphers said.
While the Biden administration helped streamline the geothermal process nationally, most of California’s geothermal opportunities are not on federal land, he pointed out. Sonoma Clean Power has worked with California Assemblymembers Diane Papan, D-San Mateo, and Chris Rogers, D-Santa Rosa, to introduce 
“Everyone universally agrees California is the best place in the United States to do this if the permitting changes,” he said, noting that the state requires a full environmental review that can take anywhere from two to eight years. “This region has enough geothermal potential to support areas beyond Sonoma and Mendocino. That’s really, really valuable for the state.”

https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/heat-pumps-dandelion-lennar,"Lennar will build 1,500 new Colorado homes with geothermal heat pumps",2 April 2025,Jeff St. John,"The homebuilder is partnering with Dandelion Energy to install the tech, which is efficient but expensive — unless it’s built into new homes from the start. 
A drilling rig drills boreholes in the Ken-Caryl Ranch development in Littleton, Colorado. The boreholes are part of the Dandelion Energy geothermal ground-source heat pumps being integrated into newly built homes from Lennar. (Dandelion Energy)
Ground-source heat pumps, which tap into the stable temperatures found hundreds of feet beneath the Earth’s surface, are a [super-efficient way to heat and cool homes](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/geothermal-heat-pumps-are-crazy-efficient-should-you-get-one). They’re also quite expensive to install in existing houses.
There’s a pretty straightforward reason: It’s hard to drill in a residential neighborhood. Hiring contractors to fit rigs into tight single-family yards and drill boreholes in places where utility infrastructure crisscrosses underfoot is a lot more complicated and expensive than installing an air-source heat pump, fossil-gas furnace, or other standard, aboveground HVAC systems.
But what if you could bore hundreds of holes at a time across a patch of cleared land and then build heat pump–equipped houses on top of them? That should be a lot cheaper. In fact, it could make ground-source heat pumps about as cheap as traditional HVAC offerings in newly built homes.
On Wednesday, Google X spinout 1,500 new homes in Colorado over the next two years, starting with Lennar’s 
The goal is simple, Kathy Hannun, Dandelion’s founder and president, told Canary Media: “Can you get the up-front cost to be lower than everything else? Because then you have no reason not to do it.”
Just being able to tackle hundreds of boreholes at a time should more than halve the drilling costs that burden existing home retrofits, she said. Large-project economies of scale and designing homes around the high-efficiency heating and cooling that Dandelion’s system provides will yield further cost reductions, she said.
And by eliminating the need for new gas pipelines and reducing the peak electricity demands on the power grid, subdivisions built on this model could save a bundle on utilities as well, she said. That’s a key benefit cited in a January report from the Department of Energy, which 
That study also found ground-source heat pumps could make a big dent in residential energy consumption and carbon emissions, particularly in climates where they outperform air-source heat pumps during cold winter weather.
But as it stands, the technology is in no more than 1% of U.S. homes, the report found. For comparison, air-source heat pumps are [now in about 13% of U.S. homes](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/how-heat-pumps-can-maintain-their-momentum-in-2025-and-beyond).
The chief barrier, once again, is the up-front expense. Dandelion has spent the past eight years 
To break into larger volume deployments, Dandelion has [an investor in Dandelion](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/dandelion-energy-raises-70m-to-take-geothermal-heat-pumps-mainstream) that now owns about 10% of the startup, she said.
## **Colorado’s push for geothermal energy**
Lennar and Dandelion aren’t disclosing cost data for the homes they’re collaborating on in Colorado. But, Hannun said, “in a few markets, the up-front cost of geothermal today is less than conventional” heating.
That’s certainly the case in Colorado, where Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, has made geothermal energy, or “the heat beneath our feet,” as he’s dubbed it 
Over the past few years, the state has passed legislation creating 2021 that spurred Xcel Energy, the state’s largest utility, [to launch a Clean Heat Plan](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/a-test-case-why-xcel-colorados-new-heat-pump-plan-is-a-big-deal) that will provide significant rebates to projects that improve energy efficiency and help customers switch from gas to electric heating.
“The rebates coming out of Xcel’s Clean Heat Plan played a really significant role in the ability of the Dandelion-Lennar investments to pan out,” said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, which manages state energy programs.
The government and utility incentives will also lower costs for people who aren’t buying these homes, because geothermal heat pump systems reduce the need for other utility infrastructure, he noted.
All-electric homes don’t need new gas pipeline extensions, the costs of which are typically recovered through increases on the bills of utility customers at large. And ground-source heat pumps need much less electricity than air-source heat pumps to keep homes warm during the coldest hours of the year, since they’re able to pull heat from deep underground thermal reservoirs rather than from cold outdoor air.
“There’s clearly some cost of putting in a geothermal system. But once it’s in there, it’s such an inexpensive approach to heating buildings,” Toor said. “If we can come up with creative ways to get these systems installed, we think it will help homeowners and businesses save money on their energy bills over the years.”
Power grids are sized to meet maximum electricity demand, so buildings that can reliably keep electricity use below certain limits minimize the need to build more grid infrastructure. These factors can make geothermal networks the least expensive option on a system-wide basis when the lifecycle costs of infrastructure and energy consumption are built in.
Xcel Energy is looking for ways to mitigate growing grid costs as it seeks 
“Based on our own research and forecasting, homes heated with ground-source heat pumps may require less electricity at peak and overall compared to homes with an air-source heat pump or resistance heating, therefore requiring fewer infrastructure investments on the grid,” Xcel spokesperson Tyler Bryant told Canary Media in an email. Xcel will study the grid impacts of Lennar and Dandelion Energy’s use of ground-source heat pumps to “inform future projects from a grid planning perspective.”
## **Neighborhood geothermal energy options**
Hannun isn’t aware of other homebuilders embedding ground-source heat pumps into large-scale single-family construction, though they are being built into [bigger buildings, including multifamily housing](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/why-this-nyc-apartment-complex-will-use-a-giant-underground-heat-pump).
But there are similar, yet distinct, approaches for single-family homes to tap underground temperature reserves to save energy and cut carbon emissions.
One is thermal energy networks — projects that [build the infrastructure needed for geothermal heat pumps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/a-net-zero-future-for-gas-utilities-switching-to-underground-thermal-networks) at a campus-wide or neighborhood scale instead of serving just one home. Utilities in [Massachusetts](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/networked-geothermal-advocates-optimistic-despite-massachusetts-setback) and [New York](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-free-buildings/new-york-will-repurpose-gas-pipelines-to-pump-clean-heat-into-buildings) are actively pursuing these projects as part of their states’ decarbonization strategies. Six other states, including [California](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/switching-california-from-gas-to-electricity-one-neighborhood-at-a-time) and 
“Geothermal heat pumps and thermal energy networks are a cost-effective way for utilities and developers to deliver clean, affordable heating and cooling, at scale, while minimizing strain on the electric grid,” said Ania Camargo, the nonprofit’s associate director of thermal networks. “The more geothermal systems we install, the better for the homeowner and the grid in the long run.”
Newly built neighborhoods can also incorporate thermal energy networks. A 7,500-home 
Under a “neighborhood-scale alternatives to the gas system that can include both electrification and thermal energy network or ground-source heat pumps,” Toor said.
Hannun agreed that shared thermal energy networks are an effective way to approach neighborhood-scale geothermal heating. But they’re also more complicated to build and administer than individual ground-source heat pumps, particularly for entities that aren’t a regulated utility with state-mandated authority to provide energy services to customers. Lennar and Dandelion opted for single-home ground loops to avoid any complications that could arise from getting lots of homeowners to commit to a shared system, she said.
Not all homebuilders will embrace the additional costs of ground-source geothermal, she said. Developers don’t pay utility bills, incentivizing them to choose the lowest-cost heating and cooling options available. At the same time, nationwide homebuilders like Lennar “often offer new products to homeowners to try to stand out,” Hannun said, and ground-source heating has “traditionally been a luxury system.”
It’s also a straightforward way to meet state or local energy-efficiency building codes, she added.
Air-source heat pumps are inherently more energy efficient than fossil-fueled furnaces, since they use energy to move heat from one place to another rather than to create heat directly. But ground-source heat pumps can be more than twice as efficient as air-source models.
“These homes will have the lowest operating cost for HVAC possible,” Hannun said. “The homeowners will spend less than if they were using air-source heat pumps or if they were using gas. And that will be locked in for the lifetime of that home because that ground loop is built to last.”","Geothermal, Carbon-free buildings, Energy efficiency, Heat pumps, West, Colorado",heat-pumps-dandelion-lennar.md,articles_geothermal
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/can-locally-made-green-ammonia-replace-fertilizer-from-fossil-fuels,Can locally made green ammonia replace fertilizer from fossil fuels?,28 May 2025,Jeff St. John,"Startup Talusag says modular plants that make ammonia from green hydrogen could cut carbon and costs from fertilizer supply chains, in America’s heartland and beyond. 
A tractor operated by agricultural cooperative Landus spreads ammonia fertilizer made by Talusag's modular, solar-powered green ammonia facility in Boone, Iowa. (Landus)
Modern farming depends on massive amounts of ammonia fertilizer, almost all of it made from fossil gas in enormous chemical plants. These facilities use high heat and pressure to split that gas, mostly made up of methane, into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere, and the hydrogen is mixed with air, where it bonds with the nitrogen under high pressure via the century-old Haber-Bosch process.
The resulting ammonia is a [carrier for the nitrogen that plants crave](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/food-and-farms/chemical-fertilizer-is-a-climate-disaster-can-high-tech-biology-fix-it), but producing it this way is highly carbon-intensive, accounting for 
Outside the town of Boone, Iowa, startup 
Talusag’s first pilot-scale facility in North America, built at a cost of about $5 million and powered by on-site solar, is capable of producing 1 to 2 tons of ammonia per day, said Talusag CEO and co-founder Hiro Iwanaga. Earlier this year, a test batch was applied to farm fields, marking the first commercial delivery of “green ammonia” from a small-scale facility in North America, 
Talusag has already started building a larger project in the nearby town of Eagle Grove, Iowa, that will be capable of producing up to 20 tons of ammonia per day. That facility, which Iwanaga said will cost about $15 million and be running later this year, will tap into grid supplies of wind power, which provides nearly three-fifths of Iowa’s annual electricity generation.
Twenty tons per day is a drop in the bucket compared to the roughly 
“We only deploy projects where we are cost-competitive or better with the incumbent competition,” he said. 
Talusag's solar-powered green ammonia production facility in Boone, Iowa. (Landus)
That’s fairly straightforward in the markets that Iwanaga and his team initially targeted. The startup launched in 2021 “largely as a philanthropic venture” to help farmers in developing countries, he said, where 
But even in America’s agricultural heartland, Talusag can propose long-term contracts at set prices at or below the cost of ammonia shipped via pipeline from the Gulf Coast and then by tanker trucks to further-flung farms, Iwanaga said.
There’s an important caveat to that, however. Talusag’s ammonia is only cost-effective in U.S. markets if generous federal incentives for producing hydrogen with low or zero carbon emissions remain in place — a prospect that is looking increasingly uncertain.
## **Can small-scale green ammonia plants supply cheaper, more reliable fertilizer?**
Talusag’s facilities use electrolyzers to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. The gas, [commonly called “green hydrogen,”](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/the-great-green-hydrogen-battle) is then fed into miniaturized versions of the gigantic Haber-Bosch reactors at industrial ammonia plants. That chemical process yields no greenhouse gas emissions — and if it uses clean electricity, it’s completely carbon-free.
Those green credentials are a nice “ancillary benefit” of the green ammonia that Landus plans to obtain from Talusag’s two Iowa facilities, said Brian Crowe, the cooperative’s vice president of strategic initiatives. But far more important to Landus and its farmer-owners are the prospects of securing a lower-cost source of fertilizer that’s made closer to home, he said.
Landus was first introduced to Talusag back in 2022, when ammonia prices rose to nearly double their typical levels, due in large part to the global disruptions to fossil fuel supplies caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Crowe said. Landus buys, stores, and transports tens of thousands of tons of ammonia per year for its farmer-members, and the agriculture industry at large was “kind of scrambling to figure out, how do we hedge against this?”
The Talusag offering “seemed like a practical solution,” he said. “Make it close to where it’s needed, do it modularly, and lock in the price to create more price stability. They produce it, we take it and pay them for it — or they don’t, and we don’t.”
Iwanaga noted that Landus isn’t taking on financial risk with these projects. Talusag pays for building and producing its green ammonia. That structure puts the pressure on Talusag to deliver on the quality and the low price it has promised to buyers.
But it also potentially provides the company with the long-term revenues it needs to secure project financing, rather than relying on equity capital. Talusag raised a 
## **The economic balancing act for green ammonia in the U.S.**
Shorter supply lines and fixed long-term prices are valuable features of Talusag’s modular model for producing green ammonia. But Iwanaga conceded that the company’s future in U.S. markets hinges on a key federal incentive that may not be around much longer — the [ hydrogen production tax credit](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/new-clean-hydrogen-rules-will-favor-some-regions-more-than-others) created by the Inflation Reduction Act.
Last week, Republicans in the House of Representatives [passed a reconciliation bill](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/house-republicans-nuke-incentives-for-clean-energy-except-nuclear) that calls for all but eliminating the federal clean energy tax credits created under the IRA. That includes 2025.
Talusag’s two projects in Iowa would squeak under that deadline, and the company may be able to start additional projects before year’s end, Iwanaga said. But if the final bill does kill the credit, that would rule out starting up any other U.S. projects for the foreseeable future, he said.
Robin Gaster, research director at the Center for Clean Energy Innovation at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation think tank in Washington, D.C., noted that would-be commercial-scale producers of ammonia fertilizer made from green hydrogen face a tough road in U.S. markets.
“It’s an interesting idea for developing countries, partly because there are supply-chain issues so often,” he said. But “I would be surprised if there were places in the United States where the supply chain and commodity costs were so bad that green ammonia is a competitive option.”
The economics of green hydrogen production do not stand up on their own without subsidies like the tax credit, he said. Today, hydrogen produced in the U.S. with fossil gas — referred to as “gray hydrogen” — costs between $1 and $2 per kilogram, depending on the price of fossil gas, whereas [green hydrogen costs $5 per kilogram and up](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/clean-hydrogen-has-a-serious-demand-problem). “The first question is obviously on cost, and whether they expect this to rely on subsidies forever.”
Crowe noted that there’s an important distinction between green hydrogen used to make ammonia for agriculture and green hydrogen that could potentially be used for industries such as trucking, shipping, and steelmaking. Farmers need ammonia now, and enormous quantities of gray hydrogen are already being used to produce it, while retooling industries like trucking and shipping to use hydrogen would require massive investments in new systems and infrastructure.
The on-again, off-again nature of U.S. clean hydrogen policy has made long-term commitments to green ammonia a tough sell. Some companies that [announced ambitious plans](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/clean-hydrogen-has-a-serious-demand-problem) to produce green ammonia in 2023 and early 2024 failed to follow through with real-world investments after the Biden administration instituted [more stringent clean-energy tracking rules for the credit](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/bidens-clean-hydrogen-tax-credits-are-officially-decided-for-now) than industry groups had hoped for. Cutting off the tax credit completely would make the economics of such projects even worse.
Iwanaga pointed out that Talusag’s technology has some advantages over large green ammonia projects, however. For one, the company’s modular systems can be [manufactured and deployed in small increments](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/go-big-or-start-small-picking-the-right-scale-for-green-hydrogen), an advantage over gigantic chemicals facilities, so that exposes Talusag’s investors to less risk, he said.
Talusag’s systems were also designed expressly to run on intermittent clean power, like the solar power serving off-grid or remote farms that were its initial target customers, he said. Most electrolyzer technologies don’t perform as efficiently when they’re forced to ramp up and down frequently to follow fluctuations in power supply. Talusag must deal with those challenges as well, but has incorporated several design features that minimize the efficiency losses, he said.
Talusag’s green ammonia technology isn’t the only one designed to [use solar and wind power when it’s available](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/the-great-green-hydrogen-battle). But being able to do that is a prerequisite not just for systems that rely on their own solar power, but also for grid-connected systems trying to capture the cheapest power available — which more and more frequently is also the cleanest.
Take the wind energy that makes up an increasing share of the electricity flowing across Midwest power grids. Iowa is the second-largest wind power producer after Texas, 2023. Other Upper Midwest states heavy on wind power as of 2023 include 
Wind farms produce when the wind is blowing, which isn’t always when most customers are using electricity — and the more surplus wind power is available, the cheaper it is, Iwanaga said. That creates strong long-term prospects for using excess wind energy to make hydrogen, which could eventually make up for the absence of federal clean-hydrogen incentives, Iwanaga said — even if the economics aren’t there yet.
A similar concept has informed a 2013, an on-site wind turbine has generated power used to electrolyze hydrogen and turn it into green ammonia. In 2023, the Minnesota state legislature created a $7 million 
[Rural electric cooperatives](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/colorado-rural-electric-coops-trump) — member-owned and -operated entities that supply power to the most sparsely populated parts of the country — may also be interested in green ammonia projects that can capture the value of wind power that might otherwise need to be curtailed, Iwanaga said. “If we can absorb some of those peaks, there are cases we are looking at where the rural electric cooperatives think it could potentially lower the cost of power.”
Gaster noted that access to cheap electricity could allow green hydrogen to compete economically with traditional ammonia production. “The cost of generating hydrogen is almost all in inputs — it’s all in the electricity,” he said.
It’s hard to say how the climate benefit of making green ammonia might stack up alongside the benefit of producing green ammonia locally, Iwanaga said. “It’s up to each customer to judge how valuable that is.”
Crowe said that Landus hasn’t yet considered the prospects of earning money from the carbon emissions prevented by buying Talusag’s green ammonia. “We don’t know exactly how it’s going to be monetized yet. But to have that in our back pocket in the future is, I think, valuable.”

https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/hydrogen-microgrid-calistoga-energy-vault-plug-power-pg-e,This hydrogen microgrid is the first of its kind. Is it a good idea?,11 August 2025,Julian Spector,"Energy Vault, Plug Power, and PGE partnered on a project that replaces diesel generators with fuel cells to provide backup power for a small town in California. 
This hydrogen microgrid should keep the power on in Calistoga, California. (Energy Vault)
CALISTOGA, Calif. — A quaint northerly outpost of Napa Valley wine country, Calistoga has struggled to keep the lights on when wildfires strike the region. Now it’s got a brand-new microgrid to run the whole town for days on end without any onsite fossil fuels, just batteries and liquid hydrogen.
After disastrous conflagrations in 2017 and 2018, utility Pacific Gas Electric began preemptively shutting off power lines to avoid sparking fires amid dangerously dry, windy conditions. 
“We were the first community in all of PGE’s network that was getting our power shut off to protect us,” said Calistoga City Council member Lisa Gift. “By 2019 we were one of the first communities to have a microgrid in all of PGE’s network, and that was being powered by diesel generators.”
PGE arranged a bank of truck-based diesel generators to sit in the town during fire season. When the utility cut grid power, the generators kicked on, belching smoke in a particularly beloved pocket of the 5,000-person community.
“We’re a small town, so they would come up and they’d be polluting the environment, taking up our dog park — loud, gross, noisy,” Gift recalled. 
Now the diesel generators are gone and the park has been turned back over to Calistoga’s canine companions. 
On a slim parcel of city land next door, publicly traded energy-storage company 234-foot, reinforced-steel tank for liquid hydrogen (designed to withstand a roaring fire, should it ever come to that) that runs a bank of hydrogen fuel cells. Altogether, this compound should be able to meet Calistoga’s electricity needs without any power from the broader grid. It’s contracted to produce up to 8.5 megawatts for 48 hours, whenever PGE shuts off grid power due to fire concerns. Refilling the hydrogen tank could let it run for several days more.
The microgrid will provide backup power to a remote corner of California wine country when the utility cuts off grid power amid high fire risk conditions. (Energy Vault)
“Even though we’re taking elements — fuel cells, batteries, liquid hydrogen storage and distribution — that have been used before in commercial settings, they’re coming together for the first time as resiliency,” said Craig Horne, Energy Vault’s senior vice president for advanced energy solutions, in an interview before the project’s unveiling in early August.
Fans of hydrogen hail it as a solution to just about any entrenched decarbonization challenge, from [heavy transport](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transportation/hydrogen-trains-and-trucks-are-coming-for-better-or-worse) to [steelmaking](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/how-the-essential-dirty-steel-industry-is-going-green) to [on-demand power](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/should-power-plants-burn-clean-hydrogen-to-make-electricity). But how hydrogen is produced makes a huge difference in its climate impact; seemingly clean sources can actually rack up major carbon emissions for negligible benefit. For now, the clean hydrogen economy remains largely speculative, with hardly any truly clean hydrogen being produced or any real projects using it. Many planned clean hydrogen projects have [vanished without a trace](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/green-industry-trump-tax-credits), following a short-lived [boom](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/clean-hydrogen-is-driving-the-next-gulf-coast-energy-boom) fueled by Biden-era support. 
In Calistoga, Energy Vault has tapped hydrogen to deal with a very specific set of constraints — delivering energy without local emissions, over multiple days, in a tight footprint — but the cleanliness of that hydrogen is a more complicated issue than public descriptions of the microgrid suggest.
The key players all have a lot riding on the project. 
Energy Vault, which previously raised several hundred million dollars in a singular bid to [multi-story robotic cranes](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/long-duration-energy-storage/energy-vault-nabs-investment-from-saudi-aramco-for-block-stacking-storage) that 8 megawatts, after 28 years of hard work). And PGE has orders from regulators to add more clean energy microgrids in communities where it regularly cuts off power — Calistoga was its first delivery on that directive, after a few years of soliciting proposals and a couple more years of permitting and construction. 
“Community microgrids are the future of the energy system,” said Craig Lewis, who advocates for such projects as executive director of the Clean Coalition nonprofit. The Calistoga microgrid is “a commercial-scale experiment, and I’m grateful for it.”
The results of that experiment will take time to analyze. It could unleash a new, replicable model for premium-priced community-level backup power. Or the quirkiness of the design and the murkiness of hydrogen’s supply chain and emissions could make it a quixotic outlier of questionable climate value.
##  **Compact and cleaner backup power in a fire zone**
The Calistoga microgrid poses an answer to the question of how to provide a few days of backup power to a small town in a small space, without worrying too much about cost. The limitations drove the design, which turned out quite unlike anything built thus far.
Energy Vault had to figure out how to pack 293 megawatt-hours of storage into just two-thirds of an acre. The lot used to hold debris from city works, like old bits of sidewalk and pipes, Horne said.
Lithium-ion batteries have proven themselves capable of storing power, be it as a Powerwall in someone’s garage or as a large-scale grid storage facility. But to store nearly 300 megawatt-hours, grid battery enclosures need more acreage than was available to lease from the city. Even if enough batteries could fit, the auxiliary power consumption for keeping them safely cooled would pose a challenge for a project that’s supposed to mostly sit around waiting for an emergency event.
Hydrogen gas can be liquefied by cooling it to ultra-low temperatures, which unlocks greater energy density. When converted back to gas and run through fuel cells, it produces a stream of electricity and no byproduct besides water vapor. That core technology powers hydrogen vehicles, though their cost and inconvenience make for a 1540 fuel cells, boxy containers with cooling units stacked on top, making them about two stories tall.
Six banks of hydrogen fuel cells can deliver 8 MW of continuous power to the town of Calistoga for as long as the tank can feed them. (Energy Vault)
The engineers added a small lithium-ion battery (7.7 MW/11.6 MWh) to perform “black start,” the complicated and crucial task of rebooting an electrical system after a complete blackout, Horne noted. The battery also buffers the output of the system while the hydrogen gets up and running. Then the power flows to Calistoga’s grid, which, when PGE shuts off the transmission lines, will be fully islanded from the surrounding network.
The hydrogen is stored onsite in an 80,000-gallon tank, manufactured in Minnesota by 
“The task is to squeeze toothpaste into a toothpaste tube that was being squeezed,” Horne said. “That’s what we proved in our acceptance testing, running for multiple hours while the fuel cells were running and a tank trailer here in the driveway is pushing liquid hydrogen into the tank itself.”
##  **Hydrogen trucked in from across the country**
The microgrid’s promise as a clean energy breakthrough, of course, hinges on the supply of clean hydrogen, but supply chains are barely getting started. Almost all commercial hydrogen is currently made from methane gas, a fossil fuel, through a procedure called steam methane reforming that sends the carbon dioxide byproduct straight into the atmosphere. 
For hydrogen to stake any claim as a climate solution, it needs to be made without massive carbon emissions. That usually involves an alternative production method called electrolysis, which separates hydrogen from water using electricity. But this method can produce even more emissions than the dirty methane version if the electrolyzers are drawing power from the grid rather than dedicated renewable sources like solar and wind (see this [previous Canary Media coverage](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/the-great-green-hydrogen-battle) for a detailed account of why that’s the case).
Energy Vault describes the hydrogen it’s using in Calistoga as “clean,” which Horne clarified as meeting the 
During a tour of the microgrid, Deepesh Goyal, vice president of stationary power at Plug Power, told Canary Media that Plug Power currently supplies hydrogen from its electrolyzer site in Georgia, which runs on grid power. More than half of Georgia’s electricity comes from fossil fuels, so that electrolysis incurs substantial power-plant emissions. Plug Power buys credits for clean energy supply to compensate for this, Goyal said. 
To meet the highest federal standard for clean hydrogen, producers need to obtain clean power matched to their consumption on an hourly basis in the areas where they operate. Plug Power did not respond in time for publication to questions clarifying what type of credits it buys. But a spokesperson for Energy Vault told Canary Media that currently there aren’t any facilities that could supply Calistoga with liquid hydrogen from electrolysis powered by time-matched, dedicated clean electricity, and the earliest such facility is targeting completion in 2026. 
Goyal also said some of Calistoga’s hydrogen comes from an unnamed partner in Las Vegas that uses renewable natural gas (RNG) as its feedstock. As it happens, legacy gas supplier RNG for the usual methane, which would make the resulting hydrogen carbon-negative according to the [convoluted calculations of California’s clean fuels bureaucracy](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/californias-new-clean-fuel-plan-makes-old-problems-worse). It’s still hydrogen made by splitting methane and releasing carbon dioxide, but it looks good on paper thanks to controversial rules that [privilege certain politically connected providers](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/california-could-lock-in-disastrous-dairy-methane-rules-advocates-warn) of RNG.
Plug Power’s fuel cells hail the arrival of green hydrogen, but their current carbon emissions profile is less clear. (Wendy Becktold) 
If someone were to design a climate solution from a blank slate, they probably wouldn’t run electrolyzers on grid power in Georgia in order to load the super-cooled hydrogen onto diesel-powered tankers and haul it more than 2,800 miles to Northern California, where it will sit around almost every day awaiting a utility power outage. 
“We still have to truck in that hydrogen,” said Gift. “That’s not ideal, but we were trucking in the diesel, and we were trucking in the diesel sometimes three times a day and burning that diesel.”
One incontrovertible fact is that the microgrid doesn’t combust anything onsite, so the operations within the fenceline emit almost no carbon emissions and don’t impact air quality. But it will be hard to gauge the real climate impacts of such a project until a more verifiably clean and geographically localized hydrogen supply chain develops. Several companies have said they will build truly green hydrogen production in the coming years. That task has only grown more difficult with the Trump administration’s efforts to thwart renewables development and vastly curtail clean hydrogen tax credits.
##  **Will other buyers accept the cost of liquid hydrogen backup?**
The other make-or-break variable for hydrogen-backed resilience is how much it costs. Liquid hydrogen is an expensive, specialty fuel only produced by a handful of suppliers in the U.S., and clean liquid hydrogen is even rarer.
For this first project, Energy Vault didn’t need to worry about consumer price sensitivity. The city of Calistoga isn’t paying Energy Vault for backup power: PGE is paying the company to provide this service, out of funds socialized across the utility customer base. In fact, Calistoga is making some money, since Energy Vault leased the land from the municipality for 10 years. 
The project’s total price tag has not been made public. Regulators allocated PGE to spend on the endeavor. Energy Vault closed 
“We can do more and waste less, and so that’s how we can be more cost effective,” he said. 
The regulatory authorization paints a different picture. The California Public Utilities Commission explicitly 
“This project was supported by a CPUC plan that said we could build a solution that costs no more than twice what it would cost to deploy diesel generation over 10 years,” said Jeremy Donnell, a senior manager for microgrid strategy and implementation at PGE. “It’s a bit of an arbitrary marker, but that’s what was laid out, and this project did come in under that threshold.”
“But still, we have a ways to go to bring the cost down,” Donnell added. “So hopefully, through implementation of this first project, Energy Vault learned a lot, the industry learned a lot on how to integrate these solutions in future projects.”
Energy Vault hopes to improve the project economics by upgrading the site to allow regular power exports to the grid. Currently, the system is configured to only push out power when PGE has scheduled a shutoff event; that means the microgrid sits idle almost every day of the year (and is unavailable for unforeseen outages, like if a tree falls on a key line). But with the right permissions and technical tweaks in place, Energy Vault expects to use the battery, and potentially even the hydrogen, to send power to California’s grid at particularly lucrative times. 
“We can now have a viable second revenue stream outside of providing that resiliency service, without compromising our ability to provide the resiliency service,” Horne said. PGE 
Going forward, Calistoga will serve as a showcase for Energy Vault’s new “H-Vault” product line, marketed as a high-tech option for long-duration clean energy needs. Hydrogen tanks will join gravity-based block stacking and conventional lithium-ion batteries as the company’s core offerings. 
For the people of Calistoga, the project softens the upheavals of living through climate change–induced extreme weather, without all the downsides of onsite fossil fuel combustion.
“Is it absolutely perfect? No,” Gift said. “But as a society, it is about making that next best right step. And for us in our community, this was that next best right step.”
For Energy Vault and the budding hydrogen industry, the next right step will be expanding hydrogen production that’s definitively low-emissions, and closing the 2,800-mile gap between supply and demand.

Here’s why. 
A slew of giga-scale green hydrogen projects have proven to be roads to nowhere. In one such case, Hy Stor had intended to build a hub for low-carbon industry on this patch of land in Mississippi. (Julian Spector/Canary Media)
This week, Senate Republicans joined their House colleagues in proposing to 
The Senate and House still need to agree on the final text of the bill, but both chambers would take a decade of incentives meant to incubate green hydrogen production and end them after this year. The truth is, though, even before Republican lawmakers sharpened their knives for the tax credit, the much-anticipated green hydrogen boom had quietly collapsed.
Just a few years ago, green hydrogen developers were planning to invest billions of dollars to build gigawatts of wind and solar capacity in prime locations from the Gulf to the desert Southwest, then funnel that electricity into huge banks of electrolyzers. These devices zap water and deliver pure hydrogen gas without the carbon dioxide released by conventional hydrogen production. Ambitious dreamers even proposed billion-dollar [pipelines to carry the gas across Texas](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/clean-hydrogen-is-driving-the-next-gulf-coast-energy-boom) to ports on the Gulf, where it could be shipped to buyers in Europe and Asia.
I caught a bit of hydrogen fever myself during a reporting trip along the Gulf Coast in December 2023.
In Mississippi, leaders from a company called Hy Stor Energy showed me a vast sandy tract, framed by mastlike pines, where they intended to build a clean industrial park powered by gigawatts of off-grid wind and solar. These power plants would electrolyze hydrogen, which Hy Stor would stash in enormous subterranean storage tanks carved from the region’s salt dome formations. Then steelmakers and chemicals companies would flock there for an uninterrupted supply of undeniably clean hydrogen.
Sure, it sounded bold, but not impossible: Hy Stor’s then-CEO Laura Luce had previously developed salt dome storage for natural gas, and elsewhere in the region, salt dome tanks already store hydrogen molecules for the Gulf petrochemical corridor.
By October 2024, though, Hy Stor had 1 gigawatt of alkaline electrolyzers from Norwegian cleantech company Nel, and the company’s leadership had moved on, per their LinkedIn pages. (When I texted a former Hy Stor leader to request comment for this story, the phone number’s new owner told me they had nothing to do with the company. A few days later, they texted me again asking if I could give them $20.)
Other firms have canceled projects partway through construction, are holding off on final investments, or have found new customers for their renewables. A few green hydrogen projects are still moving forward, but they’re either in jeopardy, heading overseas, or far more modest than the gigawatt-scale ventures recently under development.
“I think it is overstating it to say [green hydrogen] is dead,” said Sheldon Kimber, whose firm Intersect Power spent years [developing ideal wind and solar sites for hydrogen production](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/climatetech-finance/intersect-raises-750m-to-ditch-ppas-and-bet-big-on-clean-industry), before pivoting to supply clean energy to data centers. But, he added, projects that get built in the next few years are likely to rank in the tens of megawatts, not the thousands, and focus on “small-volume, high-margin markets.”
Plug Power stands out as the rare company still building substantial non-fossil-fueled hydrogen production in the U.S. It recently finished a site in St. Gabriel, Louisiana, that can liquefy 15 metric tons of hydrogen daily, bringing its total production capacity to 
Plug, however, serves as an inauspicious standard bearer for the U.S. green hydrogen industry. The 28-year-old company reported an 6.8 billion as of late March, meaning its cumulative losses outweigh any profits by that hefty amount. In February 2021, CEO Andy Marsh 500 metric tons per day of green hydrogen production by 2025; the stock traded above $60 a share at that time. Plug burned through that cash and completed just a sliver of the production goal. Currently, its stock trades at just over $1. (A company spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.)
Plug Power and other hydrogen developers attracted billions of dollars from investors on the promise that success was just around the corner. Now, though, the hydrogen build-out has collapsed under the weight of several interlocking burdens. Self-defeatingly slow federal rulemaking on tax credits, soaring production costs, a dearth of major industrial buyers, and AI’s insatiable demand for power hobbled green hydrogen construction well before the Trump administration decided to go for the jugular.
## **Tough Break # 1: IRS slow-rolled the tax credit**
The late 2010s were a euphoric time for clean energy developers. Renewables construction shot forward despite President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign vows to bring back coal. Low interest rates paired nicely with the low but predictable returns that renewables projects could generate. Entrepreneurs imagined ways to capitalize on the imminent abundance of clean electricity by converting it into hydrogen.
The Covid-19 pandemic slowed the pace of activity, but then the Biden administration passed the 2021 infrastructure law, which designated $7 billion for a series of “hydrogen hubs” around the country. The administration chased that with the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a lucrative credit for the production of clean hydrogen, up to $3 per kilogram. A new multibillion-dollar industry was in the offing, and visionaries prepared to make their moves, as soon as the Internal Revenue Service published its guidance on how to claim that credit.
Then they waited. And waited.
“At $3 per kilogram, if your plant did not qualify for that and your neighbor’s plant did, then you’re out of business,” said Brenor Brophy, who ran development for Plug Power’s hydrogen production business in the early 2020s (he is no longer with the company). But there was no airtight way of ensuring one’s project would qualify until the final rule came out.
“The Treasury Department sat on that for two and a half years,” which was worse for the industry than if the credit were never created, Brophy added.
Paralysis seized the whole supply chain. Savvy suppliers chose a wait-and-see approach. This saved them money, at the expense of the communities they had promised to invest in.
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D), for instance, famously flew to Oslo to close a deal with Norwegian electrolyzer company Nel. That firm planned to invest $400 million to build a factory near Detroit, and gain $16 million in state funds for creating some 500 jobs. Nel has 
Plug Power, not afraid to be early to the party, went ahead and built a factory in Rochester, New York, in 2021 capable of fabricating 1.5 gigawatts of electrolyzers per year. That’s a big swing compared to today’s demand: Plug noted its “the largest liquid green hydrogen plant in the U.S. market” in January 2024, contains 40 megawatts of electrolyzers.
Biden’s Treasury Department didn’t release final guidance until days before Donald Trump moved into the White House. The new administration promptly held back funds appropriated by Congress for clean energy efforts and then set about dismantling the clean energy tax credit regime.
“Most of the pipeline will get abandoned if they cannot get a $3/​kg subsidy,” said BloombergNEF analyst Xiaoting Wang. Some developers have put on a brave face and said they’ll plow ahead even without the tax credit, but she suspects such assertions are “more advertisement than a real business decision.”
Many of the planned hydrogen projects would have enriched solidly Republican districts, like Texas and Louisiana, the locus of legacy hydrogen production for petrochemical refining. But the prospect of self-inflicted economic pain has proven less of a deterrent for Republican lawmakers than industry insiders had hoped.
Project cancellations have continued amid the uncertainty. Major legacy hydrogen producer Air Products was supposed to build a $500 million green hydrogen production plant in Massena, in upstate New York. The company had cleared the 85-acre site and laid foundations to support 35 metric tons per day of green hydrogen electrolysis, per reporting by local outlet 
But new CEO Eduardo Menezes took office in February, after an activist investor attacked the company’s green hydrogen strategy. Menezes promptly 3.1 billion for breaking contracts and writing down asset value. Burning that cash seemed preferable to actually finishing and operating those projects.
“Treasury was so effective at destroying the industry that it kind of seems malicious,” Brophy said.
## **Tough Break # 2: Too many expenses, not enough hydrogen buyers**
Scaling breakthrough technologies requires faith that costs will fall and customers will want to buy. Elon Musk bet on that happening for electric cars, long before they were widely available to consumers. Solar evangelists dismissed predictions that their technology would never go anywhere; now solar is the fastest-growing new source of electricity production in the U.S. and the world.
Similarly, in that bright period before Biden-era inflation set in, hydrogen boosters saw a clear path to achieving cost declines akin to what solar and batteries had achieved. Legacy dirty hydrogen could be made for about $1 per kilogram; the green stuff cost several dollars more. But a technological learning curve could close that gap, the thinking went, and sway large industrial buyers. In 2021, the Biden Department of Energy set a goal to get green hydrogen costs down to $1 per kilogram within a decade.
Unfortunately, the cost declines that experts expected in the early 2020s never materialized. A late-2024 2 to $3 per kilogram since its March 2023 analysis. The report cites higher real-world installation costs, rising interest rates, and escalating prices for clean power to meet the IRS requirements for the tax credit.
BloombergNEF analysts looked back at real-world installation costs for electrolysis plants built in 2023, and found they were 55% higher in the U.S. and Europe than the firm had predicted in 2022. Earlier estimates had assumed the core electrolysis equipment would drive most of the cost, but in practice, the seemingly incidental factors — like utility and contractor management, and contingency planning — inflated project costs considerably, Wang noted.
Researcher Joe Romm oversaw hydrogen efforts at the DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy in the 1990s, and subsequently published a book-length critique, “
“Electrolyzers aren’t like photovoltaic cells or battery cells,” he told me recently. “There’s no ‘then a miracle occurs’ thing. … If there was going to be a learning curve, we never got there.”
Solar panels and battery cells are identical units that get mass-produced economically. Electrolyzer systems require more hands-on and bespoke installation work, with pipes and pumps and compressors and water tanks.
The other problem with analogizing green hydrogen to wind, solar, and batteries is a key difference in their uses. The latter group delivers electricity, which is distributed and used across modern society. But clean hydrogen requires highly specialized infrastructure to transport and utilize the famously flighty molecule.
“Someone’s going to have to take a big gamble, and if they lose, they’re stuck with a stranded asset,” Romm noted. An electrolysis plant with no green hydrogen customers can’t do anything else. And would-be producers struggled to find any committed customers.
Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy for J.P. Morgan Asset and Wealth Management, tallied the missing demand to damning effect in his 46). He calculated that only 1% of green hydrogen projects slated for completion by 2030 have a binding offtake agreement.
That’s not to say developers were crazy for trying. A few years ago, major companies in Asia and Europe seemed eager to purchase large volumes of green hydrogen for their decarbonization plans, said Kimber, from Intersect Power. Such high-volume deals were vital for justifying construction of gigawatt-scale electrolysis projects in the sunny, windy sites of the American West.
“We had plenty of negotiations for gigawatt and multi-gigawatt-scale hydrogen, but most of them were with European and Asian customers, and most of those folks have backed away from the table,” Kimber said. “Without that policy certainty, no large oil company, steel company, power company is going to move ahead purchasing green molecules globally.”
Lacking that kind of anchor customer, a developer can’t justify building big or financing a whole pipeline to market — the billion-dollar gigaprojects depend on high utilization to make any financial sense, Kimber noted. They’re not something you can build and then wait a few years for demand to materialize.
## **Tough Break # 3: AI computing stole the initiative**
Electrolysis devours electricity, which is fine in a world of cheap and abundant power. But, suddenly, any fledgling hydrogen project has to compete with much better-funded rivals in electric gluttony: [AI computing hubs](https://www.canarymedia.com/boon-or-bane-what-will-data-centers-do-to-the-grid).
The business calculus of clean hydrogen necessitated driving down energy costs as much as possible to compete with cheap dirty hydrogen. For green hydrogen ventures to succeed, they would need to render their product a cheap commodity.
AI customers, on the other hand, are flush with cash and willing to pay top dollar to anyone who could deliver them gobs of power as soon as possible.
“When you enable a more valuable product, the total pie of value for the supply chain to carve up is greater,” Kimber said. “That makes the whole process of dealing with your customer and your vendors and everybody just less of a fight to the death. Everybody can truly be focused on, how do we scale this industry?”
For clean energy developers like Intersect, then, the choice to swap customers was uncomplicated. They had scouted the most energy-rich acreage they could find, but the big buyers for green hydrogen never showed up, and suddenly the wealthiest tech companies in the world wanted to sign deals ASAP.
“We were never a hydrogen company,” Kimber said. “We have been, are, and will be a company that is focused on finding ways to use the massive surpluses of all forms of energy that exist in places like West Texas, the panhandle of Texas, to power new industrial loads.”
“Now, it’s very easy for us to pivot into data centers,” he continued. “We’re negotiating AI data centers on all of our large [hydrogen] projects right now.”
## **Can small-scale, customer-oriented hydrogen projects survive?**
Plug Power CEO Marsh opened a 
“My first reaction was, we’re going to have to work to start construction this year to make sure that that plant would qualify,” Marsh told investors, referencing a development in Texas.
Then, tellingly, he handed the mic to Chief Revenue Officer Jose Luis Crespo, who talked up the bounty awaiting across the Atlantic, saying “Europe today is the most dynamic electrolyzer market in the world.” The European Union’s binding hydrogen procurement rules will soon kick in, and electrolysis projects at the 100-megawatt scale are starting to move toward reality, he explained.
Instead of building gigawatts of electrolyzers in the U.S. to export hydrogen to Europe, investment might just flow there instead.
Other U.S. entrepreneurs hope to survive through a more targeted approach: building small but closer to customers. The U.S. already produces 10 million metric tons of hydrogen per year for industrial users; many of them are open to cleaner and cheaper options, said Matt McMonagle, founder and CEO of startup NovoHydrogen.
“There’s no pricing transparency in this market; it’s very opaque,” he said. “There’s no 
Green electrolysis still can’t compete with the $1 per kilogram that it costs to make dirty hydrogen at huge petrochemical complexes with cheap natural gas. But companies that get smaller deliveries of super-cooled liquid hydrogen can pay anywhere from $5 to $50 per kilogram, depending on region and shipping distance, McMonagle explained.
“We try to focus on the ones where we can save the customer money,” he said, recalling prior experience selling solar and batteries to businesses that wanted to cut their utility bills. And, unlike so many giga-scale hydrogen projects, NovoHydrogen actually has signed offtake agreements. “There’s no project without a customer,” McMonagle noted.
Novo is developing 10-megawatt electrolyzer systems at customer sites, which can produce about 2 metric tons per day depending on uptime, McMonagle explained. These projects will hook up to the grid, drawing power via clean energy supply agreements from the local utility. By building on-site, Novo needn’t worry about constructing pipelines across hundreds of miles or driving a fleet of super-cold tanker trucks.
Novo’s bigger projects function more like community solar: They’re located off-site but still near customers. Novo intends to install 235 megawatts of solar production across 1,000 acres in 2028, this facility should make about 27 metric tons per day. That’s nothing close to the colossal projects other companies contemplated at the height of the boom times, but it’s still bigger than any single green hydrogen source in the U.S. today.
As McMonagle sees it, the lure of the $3-per-kilogram credit attracted maybe too much attention to hydrogen, beyond situations where it really makes sense.
“A lot of people may have been chasing a shiny object and didn’t understand the details,” McMonagle said. “Let’s burst the bubble. I don’t think that means green hydrogen as an industry is gone — it will play a fundamental role in certain use cases. Trying to do everything just invites criticism that’s frankly valid.”
Hydrogen’s critics have long insisted that it never made much sense, either as a decarbonization strategy or a moneymaking venture. They see the industry’s implosion as a chance to avoid plowing billions of dollars into a technological dead end. Many climate advocates have dismissed hydrogen as a guise for fossil-fuel interests to prolong the use of their planet-warming product; they won’t be shedding any tears now.
But for the contingent of hydrogen entrepreneurs who emerged from successful renewables firms, the sudden loss of momentum delivers a yearslong setback in efforts to clean up heavy-duty transport, steelmaking, and other industries that are hard to decarbonize, and a missed opportunity to head off the worst impacts of climate change.
“I worry we’ve lost a decade, and that was a decade we didn’t have,” said Brophy.
The sudden vaporization of the imagined green hydrogen economy may be the kind of healthy correction this market needed. Whichever hydrogen projects ultimately get built could prove more durable for having made it through the ringer after the days of easy money. But that’s paltry consolation for the townships and states that were promised billion-dollar projects and high-tech jobs within a couple years. Beyond the economic hit, the green hydrogen collapse removes a leading contender for cleaning up the most carbon-intensive industries — at least until the next hydrogen boom comes around.","Hydrogen, Clean industry, Climatetech finance",green-industry-trump-tax-credits.md,articles_hydrogen
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/ny-ferry-switch-maritime-sea-change,San Francisco launched a hydrogen ferry. Now NYC may get one too.,3 September 2025,Maria Gallucci,"After a successful run in California, the company behind the world’s first commercial hydrogen ferry is bringing clean, quiet marine transit to New York. 
The hydrogen-powered Sea Change ferry navigates San Francisco Bay in July 2024. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)
Just over a year ago, the world’s first commercial hydrogen ferry [officially set sail](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/sea-transport/san-francisco-launches-worlds-first-commercial-hydrogen-ferry) in the San Francisco Bay, offering a clean, quiet rebuttal to the noisy, polluting ferries that many coastal cities depend on.
Now, the vessel’s owner is working to build a bigger, faster version in New York.
Switch Maritime was recently 150-passenger ferry powered by hydrogen fuel cells — a technology that doesn’t directly emit carbon dioxide or toxic air pollution, just a little heat and water vapor. The company says it aims to launch the vessel around early 2028 in New York City waterways as part of a 12-month demonstration period, before potentially transitioning to longer-term service.
“Ferry operators have aging fleets that need to be replaced,” said Pace Ralli, CEO and cofounder of Switch. “We’re trying to give these operators a viable alternative to rebuilding and renewing their fleet with diesel.”
More than 600 ferries ply the country’s waterways. The vast majority of them still burn diesel fuel, leaving smoggy trails of planet-warming gases and health-harming pollutants in their wake.
Some of the nation’s biggest ferry operators — including those in New York City, San Francisco, and Washington state — are starting to test and deploy cleaner marine technologies to meet their climate goals and improve air quality in waterfront communities.
Last month, New York City [launched a $33 million hybrid-electric ferry](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/sea-transport/new-york-first-hybrid-electric-ferry?utm_campaign=canary&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8HNkH0fPNYO02tKYwqMJYEJcHJRuLNZQ9caed8jIAprWR86IrqvfV8aEkabJG-YxJx-sUNd5pcTBUd-fya18WE6lFSVw&_hsmi=376757121&utm_source=newsletter) that uses batteries and diesel generators. A handful of other hybrid and fully battery-powered vessels are operating or under construction nationwide, and hundreds more have hit the water in China and Europe.
For now, Switch’s San Francisco ferry is the only fully hydrogen-powered vessel in the U.S.
The boat, called Sea Change, launched in July 2024 after more than six years in development. The 75-passenger ferry includes 360 kilowatts of fuel cells, a 600-kW electric propulsion system, lithium-ion batteries, and 10 tanks that can store a total of 246 kilograms of hydrogen. The vessel uses the most readily available type of hydrogen — the kind produced using fossil gas — which is sourced from existing automotive fueling stations in the San Francisco area.
The New York ferry will be twice the size and operate twice as fast as Sea Change, said Seamus Nolan, Switch’s director of commercial and government affairs. He said the $2 million grant from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority will help fund the company’s initial work to develop the larger vessel and cover some operational costs during the yearlong demonstration period.
Just as crucial as launching the ferry will be establishing a hydrogen supply chain for this specific project, given that no such networks exist today in the U.S. maritime industry. Nolan said that Switch has identified three potential suppliers of green hydrogen — made from renewable energy sources — that could initially serve the new vessel’s operations, though future supplies could include hydrogen made from nuclear or [methane pyrolysis](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/these-startups-turn-fossil-gas-into-hydrogen-without-all-the-emissions) as those production methods scale.
A lack of cheap, clean hydrogen remains one of the biggest barriers to taking fuel-cell ferries mainstream. It’s also a key reason why ferry operators are primarily turning to battery-powered boats to begin greening their fleets. Hydrogen fuel is substantially more expensive to make and transport than diesel fuel, and producers remain reluctant to ramp up supplies — and thus drive down prices — given the uncertainty around customer demand.
This was already true under the Biden administration. Now the second Trump administration is moving to scrap federal policies meant to accelerate production of clean hydrogen, including by potentially 7 billion Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs program. The budget law passed by congressional Republicans in July also [hastens the phaseout](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/tax-credit-changes-trump-law) of the tax credit for clean hydrogen production.
“If done safely, green hydrogen is a viable alternative fuel for maritime … but there’s a lot of concerns around, how do we scale up green hydrogen production so that it’s affordable for maritime use and that there’s enough supply?” said Teresa Bui, senior climate campaign director at the nonprofit group Pacific Environment.
During the Sea Change trial in San Francisco, the vessel experienced “minor disruptions due to fuel sourcing at times,” though routine maintenance work and occasional mechanical issues were bigger causes of interrupted service, said Thomas Hall, director of operations and customer experience for San Francisco Bay Ferry, which ran the hydrogen ferry during the demonstration period.
From July 2024 to January 2025, Sea Change zipped along a short tourist route between the historic Ferry Building and Fisherman’s Wharf. The temporary pilot service was sponsored by a group of private partners, including Chevron New Energies, United Airlines, and the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway, and Transportation District.
Hall said the ferry operator is evaluating the demonstration’s results, which will help inform its longer-term plans. The Water Emergency Transportation Authority, which oversees San Francisco Bay Ferry, has secured more than $150 million in local, state, and federal funding to 
“Being part of a first-in-the-world, groundbreaking project is something we value a lot here in the Bay Area,” Hall said. “It was a huge achievement that will make future implementations easier.”
Since the pilot ended earlier this year, Switch and its vessel operator partner Blue Gold Fleet have been running tests to see how Sea Change performs on critical commuter routes in the San Francisco Bay Area. The plan is to bring the vessel back into passenger service in the coming months, either in San Francisco or in a new city that is looking to test the technology.
“Sea Change is one proof-of-concept to show that it can be done, that it can be operated commercially,” Nolan said of the hydrogen fuel-cell ferry. The New York demonstration will be Switch’s chance to prove the technology can operate at twice the scale.","Hydrogen, Public transit, Transportation, Northeast, New York",ny-ferry-switch-maritime-sea-change.md,articles_hydrogen
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-aluminum/us-manufacturing-power-challenges,"US aluminum producers need cheap, clean power. That may be tough to get.",30 July 2025,Maria Gallucci,"Century Aluminum and Emirates Global Aluminium want to build the nation’s first smelters in decades, but must compete with data centers for a limited power supply. 
Emirates Global Aluminium plans to build a $4 billion smelter in Oklahoma. (EGA)
Plans are in the works to build America’s first new aluminum smelters in nearly half a century. The two facilities, slated to go online in [possibly Kentucky](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-aluminum/a-new-green-aluminum-plant-could-bring-jobs-and-clean-energy-to-kentucky) in the coming years, would dramatically boost domestic production of the versatile metal if completed as planned.
But for that to happen, they will first have to secure a steady supply of electricity, at a time when AI data centers and other industrial facilities are [competing fiercely](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/data-centers-are-overwhelming-the-grid-could-they-help-it-instead) for a share of the country’s limited power resources, and as the grid is strained by surging demand.
The smelters proposed by Emirates Global Aluminium and Century Aluminum would be energy hogs. Each plant is expected to produce about 600,000 metric tons of aluminum each year, requiring enough electricity annually to power the state of Rhode Island. That’s because the process of converting raw materials into primary aluminum requires hundreds of megawatts of power running at near-constant rates.
For the economics to pencil out for either facility, that power will need to be cheap. And it will need to be produced from carbon-free sources, like wind or solar, for the aluminum they produce to be more competitive on the global market, which increasingly favors low-carbon metal.
Unfortunately for American aluminum producers, both clean and affordable power are only getting harder to come by.
Electricity demand in the U.S. is [rising faster](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/data-centers-are-driving-us-power-demand-to-hard-to-reach-heights) than supply is forecast to grow, which is pushing up prices. Aging grid infrastructure and slow permitting timelines have long delayed the build-out of new power generation. Now the Trump administration and GOP-led Congress are creating additional financial and legal [headwinds](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/wind-solar-construction-trump-tax-credits) for wind, solar, and battery storage projects — the only resources that can be built fast enough to meet demand in the near term.
“With clean energy tax credits going away, we can reasonably expect the cost of electricity to go up in all markets,” said Annie Sartor, the aluminum campaign director for Industrious Labs, an advocacy organization. “That’s just profoundly challenging to aluminum facilities that are looking for electricity … especially in a moment when there’s a rush on electricity nationally.”

The deepening power crunch represents a major roadblock in the quest to reshore U.S. manufacturing.
The Trump administration recently 25% to 50% to bolster the business case for producing primary metals domestically. It has also preserved a 500 million as part of a federal industrial decarbonization program, much of which has since been [defunded](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/trump-industrial-decarbonization-funding-cuts).
But to successfully kick-start an American aluminum renaissance, the government and utilities will also need to make larger 
“Ultimately, this is about energy,” said Matt Meenan, vice president of external affairs for the Aluminum Association, a trade group that supports an “all-of-the-above” approach to electricity sources.
“And until you crack that nut,” he added, “I think we’re going to have a hard time becoming fully self-sufficient for primary aluminum in the U.S.”
## **America’s smelter count dropped from 33 to 4 **
Aluminum companies worldwide produced 2024. The lightweight metal is used to make products as varied as fighter jets, power cables, soda cans, and deodorant. It’s also a key component of clean energy technologies like electric vehicles, solar panels, and heat pumps.
Producing aluminum contributes about 2% of total greenhouse gas emissions every year. The majority of those emissions come from generating high volumes of electricity — often derived from fossil fuels — to power smelters. The smelting process involves dissolving powdery white alumina in a scorching-hot salt bath, then zapping it with electrical currents to remove oxygen molecules and make aluminum.
The United States was once one of the world’s top producers of primary aluminum. In 1980 — the last year a new smelter was built — the nation had 33 operating facilities, many of which relied on cheap power from public hydropower plants. But then industrial electricity rates began to rise after the federal government restructured energy markets in 1977.
Deregulation was “the single most important factor leading to the near total demise of the primary aluminum industry,” the Aluminum Association said in a recent white paper entitled “2001, leading to a glut of inexpensive Chinese aluminum on the global market.
Today, just four American smelters remain operational. In 2024, they produced an estimated 1% of global production. The U.S. [mainly makes secondary aluminum](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-aluminum/cans-to-car-parts-inside-the-complex-crucial-world-of-aluminum-recycling) from scrap metal, which totaled over 5 million metric tons last year. While secondary production is growing, it can’t fully replace the need for strong and durable primary aluminum. 
U.S. primary aluminum production (blue) has declined over time while its reliance on primary aluminum imports (gray) has risen in step. Note: The shading in the chart correlates with market share, with darker colors corresponding to higher market shares. (
“There’s always going to be a role for primary aluminum,” Meenan said. “And we do think having smelters here is really important.”
## **Power-supply talks underway for two new smelters**
Century Aluminum and Emirates Global Aluminium both say their new smelters will mark a new beginning for the U.S. primary-aluminum sector. The two facilities would together nearly triple the nation’s primary-aluminum capacity when they come online, potentially around 2030.
Century Aluminum first 2024, after the Biden-era Department of Energy launched a $6 billion initiative to modernize and decarbonize America’s industrial base. As part of the award process, Century said its Green Aluminum Smelter could run on 100% renewable or nuclear energy and would use energy-efficient designs, making it 75% less carbon-intensive than traditional smelters.
At the time, the Chicago-based manufacturer identified northeastern Kentucky as its preferred location for the smelter, though the company was also evaluating sites in the Ohio and Mississippi river basins. More than a year later, Century still hasn’t picked a final project site for the $5 billion smelter — because it hasn’t yet locked down its power supply.
Electricity isn’t available at the fixed long-term price that smelters need to ensure profitability and pay back billions of dollars in construction costs, Matt Aboud, Century’s senior vice president of strategy and business development, said in May at a global aluminum summit in London, 
“We remain really excited about the project,” Jesse Gary, Century’s president and CEO, said on a May 7 “The next two key milestones are to finalize negotiations of the power arrangements, and then following from that … we’ll be making a site selection.”

The Aluminum Association estimates that manufacturers would need a 20-year power contract at or below $40 per megawatt-hour to justify investing in a new smelter at today’s aluminum prices. Restarting the nation’s fleet of idled smelters, which represent 601,500 metric tons in primary capacity, would require a similar arrangement.
Currently, power-purchase agreements for U.S. renewable energy projects are 50 to $60 per MWh — a significant difference for these power-hungry facilities. Tech giants like Microsoft have signaled their willingness to pay north of $100 per MWh for electricity from nuclear and fossil-gas plants to fuel their data centers, giving those firms an advantage over price-sensitive buyers in the race for electricity.
Meanwhile, in Oklahoma, Emirates Global Aluminium is advancing its $4 billion smelter project with the promise of significant financial support from taxpayers and utility customers.
The Abu Dhabi-based conglomerate in May signed a nonbinding 275 million in incentives, including discounts for power. The manufacturer and governor’s office are working to establish a “special rate offer” from the Public Service Co. of Oklahoma — a subsidiary of utility giant AEP — for the new facility.
Simon Buerk, EGA’s senior vice president for corporate affairs, said that Oklahoma’s “energy abundance” was a key factor in selecting the state for the new aluminum smelter.
More than 40% of Oklahoma’s annual electricity generation comes from wind turbines spinning on open prairies, while about half the state’s generation comes from fossil-gas power plants. Last month, the Public Service Co. 795-MW gas plant just south of Tulsa to meet the rising energy needs of its customers, including potentially EGA.
Buerk said EGA and the utility are in “advanced negotiations” to finalize a competitive power contract. One option the groups are considering is a tariff structure that gives the smelter dedicated long-term access to a proportion of renewable energy, equal to 40% of the smelter’s needs. The smelter’s annual power mix “will be based on EGA’s decarbonisation objectives, market dynamics, and market demand for low-carbon aluminum,” he said by email.
## **Affordable, clean energy remains key to powering smelters**
Outside the United States, nearly all primary aluminum smelters receive some form of government backing in the countries where they operate — typically by ensuring access to affordable energy, said Sartor of Industrious Labs.
She pointed to Canada, the largest supplier of U.S. aluminum imports. Smelters in Quebec draw from the region’s abundant hydropower resources, which are operated by the government-owned entity Hydro-Quebec. The price of electricity that producers pay is often tied to the price of aluminum on commodities markets, so that smelters pay less during lean times and more when the market recovers.
“The industry functions through government support all over the world, and we should be looking at those models and finding one that fits us here,” said Sartor.
Manufacturers and utilities can also structure power-supply agreements that enable smelters to benefit, rather than strain, the grid, said Anna Johnson, a senior researcher in the industry program at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
“When we think about how to address the challenge of procuring large amounts of clean power, one of the first tools we think about is, what can we do on the demand side to mitigate that load and make sure that the demand of these facilities is avoiding times of peak stress?” she said.
In New Zealand, for example, Rio Tinto’s Tiwai Point smelter [receives financial incentives](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-aluminum/new-zealand-has-a-surprising-tool-to-boost-its-grid-an-aluminum-plant) to curb its electricity use — and therefore lower its aluminum production — during dry seasons, when hydropower resources can become critically low. In Australia, the aluminum giant Alcoa is participating in a program that turns one of its smelters into an emergency resource when the grid is overly stressed. The Australian government pays Alcoa to halt production on some of its aluminum-making potlines for about an hour at a time.
In the U.S., other types of industrial plants — including a [titanium-melting plant](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/in-a-first-a-solar-microgrid-will-directly-power-an-industrial-plant) in West Virginia — are using behind-the-meter solar power and battery storage systems, so that the facilities are primarily drawing from the electrical grid only during off-peak hours.
Strategies like these that reduce electricity rates are especially crucial now that the development of cheap, renewable energy is set to slow in the United States. But manufacturers will still need access to new carbon-free electricity sources in order to produce the cleaner aluminum that customers are increasingly demanding, Sartor said.
“When [companies] build a new facility, they’re building it for 50 or 100 years,” she said. Even as the Trump administration winds back the clock on U.S. climate action, smelters “need to find clean power as a matter of international competitiveness.”","Clean aluminum, Clean energy",us-manufacturing-power-challenges.md,articles_clean-aluminum

Earlier this week, two low-carbon cement startups unveiled new partnerships with data-center developers and operators, which are looking at ways to curb the tech sector’s ballooning climate impact.
The separate announcements from Sublime Systems and Brimstone are a striking example of how businesses are pressing ahead with efforts to decarbonize essential polluting industries like cement making — even as the Trump administration [guts federal programs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/trump-rescinds-federal-program-to-boost-low-carbon-building-materials) meant to kick-start U.S. manufacturing of cleaner construction materials.
Both companies are developing novel ways of producing cement that don’t cook the planet in the process. Cement — the gluey powder mixed with sand, gravel, and water to form concrete — is responsible for roughly 8% of global carbon dioxide emissions. Nearly all cement is made today by heating carbon-rich limestone in fossil-fuel-burning kilns.
Sublime, an MIT spinout, said on Tuesday that it completed a “
Demonstration projects [like these](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/sublime-systems-low-carbon-cement-goes-commercial) are key to convincing the inherently cautious construction industry to embrace new approaches. “It gives us a proof point to then [do] larger-scale deployments in a few years,” Cory Waltrip, Sublime’s director of business development and strategy, told Canary Media.
Those future deployments could include facilities run by Microsoft. The tech giant recently 622,500 metric tons of Sublime’s cement products — enough to build roughly 30 professional football stadiums — from the startup’s forthcoming manufacturing facilities. The agreement marks a massive step up for Sublime, which can currently make just 250 metric tons of cement per year at its pilot plant in Somerville, Massachusetts.
Brimstone, for its part, also announced on Tuesday that it 2 trillion, to reserve future supplies of Brimstone’s low-carbon cement, though the partners declined to provide more specific details.
Oakland, California–based Brimstone sources carbon-free rocks instead of limestone, then pulverizes those rocks and adds chemical agents to leach out valuable minerals. Certain compounds are heated in a rotary kiln to make [key component of aluminum](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/clean-cement-startup-brimstone-can-make-another-key-material-alumina).
Cody Finke, Brimstone’s co-founder and CEO, said Amazon began testing Brimstone’s products about a year ago and found they worked just as well as the conventional materials used in Amazon’s buildings. Amazon will get its supply from Brimstone’s $378 million commercial demonstration plant, which is slated to be operating by the end of the decade, Finke said.
The announcements send an important signal that private-sector demand isn’t waning for cleaner construction products — despite the White House [abandoning strategies](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/states-are-moving-forward-with-buy-clean-policies-despite-trump-reversal) and rescinding funding for using greener cement, steel, glass, and other materials in public buildings, roads, and bridges.
Melissa Hulting, director for industrial decarbonization at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, said she was “really excited” about the latest news from Sublime and Brimstone.
“In the absence of federal demand … it’s great to see that companies are stepping in and supporting procurement” of low-carbon cement, she said. “I’m hoping that we’ll see more companies, especially with the building up of these data centers, come in and fill that void.”
Still, green cement startups continue to face a sizable challenge in scaling up their pioneering manufacturing plants. The task is likely to be even harder now that the Department of Energy has clawed back crucial funding for industrial decarbonization initiatives.
In late May, the DOE said it was [canceling over $3.7 billion](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/trump-cut-funding-oced) in awards for two dozen projects aimed at decarbonizing everything from cement kilns and glassmaking furnaces to mac-and-cheese factories and whiskey distilleries. Sublime was slated to get up to $87 million to build its commercial-scale cement facility in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Brimstone had been awarded up to $189 million to finance the construction of its commercial plant, the site for which is still being decided.
Both Sublime and Brimstone said they’re in ongoing conversations with the DOE to try to appeal the decision. In the meantime, however, the startups are moving forward as planned with their manufacturing facilities.
Finke said Brimstone’s award cancellation felt like an “oversight, because critical materials are such an important topic for the Trump administration.” But he said that losing the federal funding doesn’t affect the company’s long-term strategy, which is focused on raising private capital. To date, the six-year-old startup has raised over $80 million from investors.
Sublime, meanwhile, has raised over $200 million since its founding in 2020, a figure that includes the DOE award. Leah Ellis, Sublime’s co-founder and CEO, said the startup remains on track to begin delivering cement to Microsoft and other customers from its Holyoke facility in 2028.
“We do think what we’re doing is aligned with the current administration’s priorities of creating jobs and investing in modernizing and onshoring manufacturing of important materials,” she said.
“Everything inside Sublime is going as well as we could hope,” Ellis added. “Nobody thought that scaling up a new cement technology would be easy, right? But that’s what we’re here for.”","Clean industry, Emissions reduction",tech-giants-look-to-low-carbon-cement-to-curb-their-huge-climate-impact.md,articles_clean-industry

Although more manufacturers are adopting industrial heat-pump technology, like AtmosZero’s Boiler 2.0 pictured above, the electric equipment remains rare. (AtmosZero)
Cheese. Beer. Clothes. Paper. Manufacturers across the country rely on combustion boilers to produce the heat required for making a range of products. But by burning coal, oil, gas, and other fuels to do so, that equipment spews health-harming and planet-warming pollution into the skies. 
A different technology would allow communities to breathe easier. Electric heat pumps, which can provide industrial heat without emissions, are [spreading](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/this-map-shows-where-to-swap-out-industrial-boilers-for-heat-pumps#:~:text=Only%20about%205,heat-pump%20replacements.) but remain underutilized.

Now, a 1.1 trillion in public health benefits and avoid 77,200 pollution-inflicted deaths from 2030 to 2050, according to a report released Thursday by the nonprofit American Lung Association.
It’s a move “that’s going to save lives, reduce health emergencies, cut asthma attacks, [and] keep kids healthy enough to be in school rather than missing school days,” said Will Barrett, an assistant vice president at the American Lung Association who works on national clean air policy.
Nearly half of the U.S. population lives in places with 
Like other fossil-fuel-burning machines, such as home appliances and cars, industrial combustion boilers release nitrogen oxides, fine particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide into the air. These toxic byproducts can harm children and adults in severe ways, such as asthma attacks, preterm births, heart attacks, strokes, and an impaired ability to think.
To quantify the benefits of switching to industrial heat pumps, the authors created an inventory of the industrial boilers across the U.S. based on publicly available data. They found that about 33,500 boilers scattered around the nation operate at the low and medium temperatures — i.e., less than 200 degrees Celsius — that make them the best candidates for heat pumps to replace. (For now, heat pumps are most feasible for lower temperatures, though Barrett noted research-and-development efforts will bring down the costs for higher-temperature changeouts over time.)
The team then estimated how much pollution would be avoided by gradually swapping these boilers out for electric heat pumps over the next 15 years, with lower temperatures addressed soonest. By leveraging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s 33 million asthma attacks, 204,000 asthma cases, 13 million lost school days, and 3.4 million lost work days.
States in which more people live close to industrial pollution sources would experience the greatest boost to public health and productivity, according to the team’s analysis. The three with the biggest estimated health benefits are Florida, which would save $107 billion over the study period, Pennsylvania ($82 billion), and North Carolina ($68 billion). Twenty-three others would save at least $25 billion each.
The transition would also reduce carbon emissions by 1.6 billion metric tons through 2050. That translates to $351 billion in avoided societal costs due to a destabilized climate — which is already being felt in 
The findings come as the Trump administration aggressively rolls back [emissions regulations](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/epa-moves-to-defang-its-own-regulatory-power), and support for industrial decarbonization projects, having cancelled [$3.7 billion in funding](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/trump-cut-funding-oced) in May.
To push industries to switch to heat pumps, the report recommends state and local policymakers offer manufacturers incentives to electrify their heating, launch education campaigns aimed at communities and companies, and require the adoption of nonpolluting equipment. California has taken the lead; its South Coast Air Quality Management District passed a [first-in-the-nation measure](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/southern-california-adopts-landmark-rule-to-electrify-industrial-heat) last year to gradually phase out combustion boilers and process heaters starting in 2026.

Can electric furnaces provide it?,24 September 2025,Maria Gallucci,"Glass-melting furnaces reach over 3,000°F. Most of that heat comes from burning fossil gas, but some manufacturers are looking to slash emissions by electrifying.

Glassmaking has dramatically evolved in the thousands of years since ancient artisans crafted their first decorative beads and perfume bottles. But the underlying recipe remains virtually the same: Combine sand, sodium carbonate, and limestone, then blast the ingredients with scorching heat in a kiln or furnace.
Today, the vast majority of that heat is supplied by burning fossil fuels. Whether manufacturers are turning glass into windows, beverage bottles, smartphone screens, or coatings for solar panels, their methods require lots of energy to reach superhigh temperatures and, as a result, can be very carbon-intensive.
Global glassmakers in recent years 
The latest of these emerging efforts comes from Bavaria, Germany, where the multinational firm Schott 
Schott says its electric tank could slash greenhouse gas emissions from the melting process alone by 80% owing to the reduction in fossil gas use. The 40-million-euro ($47 million) pilot tank is expected to fire up in early 2027 and will produce specially engineered glass tubing for syringes, vials, and other pharmaceutical products.
Jonas Spitra, Schott’s head of sustainability communications, said that replacing fossil fuels with electrified technology — while still meeting strict quality requirements for specialty glass — marks “one of the most challenging yet decisive steps on the industry’s path to decarbonization.”
Schott, which operates in over 30 countries, will use the experiences from its all-electric tank initiative “as a foundation for expanding electrification to other sites, wherever technically and economically feasible,” he told Canary Media.

The German pilot project is moving forward just as a few ambitious low-carbon glass initiatives in the United States have [fallen into limbo](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/trump-cut-funding-oced). In May, the Trump administration’s Department of Energy canceled awards worth roughly $177 million for projects aiming to demonstrate cleaner glassmaking methods in California and Ohio, forcing manufacturers to reevaluate their plans.
“Domestic glass manufacturers across the country are advancing energy-efficient technologies, reducing emissions, and working to try and keep jobs onshore,” Scott DeFife, president of the Glass Packaging Institute, said in a DOE’s decision. “The Department should lean into glass, not ignore it.”
## **Getting hot enough to melt glass**
Worldwide, manufacturers made more than 150 million metric tons of glass in total in 2022. Although glass is used across many sectors, it is produced on a smaller scale than other carbon-intensive materials. Cement production, for instance, surpassed 4 billion metric tons in 2023, while steel production reached nearly 2 billion metric tons that year.
Still, glassmaking remains a significant source of planet-warming gases and local air pollutants like nitrogen oxides. And the challenge of slashing those emissions is essentially the same one vexing other heavy industries: figuring out how to reach hot enough temperatures to make materials without cooking the planet in the process.
Chemical producers are [pilot-testing their own electric furnaces](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/this-key-chemical-is-super-dirty-to-make-can-an-electric-furnace-help) to make important compounds like ethylene, which is the building block of many plastic products. Cement startups are developing [electricity-driven processes](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/sublime-systems-low-carbon-cement-goes-commercial) and [thermal storage systems](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/rondos-heat-batteries-will-soon-be-cleaning-up-factories-in-us-europe) to replace traditional kilns. Global steelmakers, meanwhile, are [investing in technologies](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/us-iron-furnace-cleaner) that sidestep the need to use coal, such as hydrogen-based ironmaking facilities and electric arc furnaces.
For glass, the biggest hurdle to decarbonization lies in the melting process, Schott’s Spitra explained.
Schott researchers conduct tests on a lab-scale electric melting tank for pharmaceutical glass in Germany. (Schott)
Glass furnaces require temperatures of between 1,200 and 1,700 degrees Celsius (2,192 and 3,092 degrees Fahrenheit) — hotter than lava — to liquefy the raw materials and mix in recycled glass. The process is responsible for about two-thirds of total carbon dioxide emissions from glass production. Most of that CO comes from burning fossil fuels, though some emissions result from the chemical reactions that happen when heating up sodium carbonate (soda ash) and limestone.
In a conventional furnace, gas is injected into a combustion chamber to melt the ingredients into a glowing orange liquid. In an electric version, electrodes pass currents through a conductor to generate heat. Today, the industry mostly uses electric equipment only for smaller-scale furnaces or to supplement the fossil-fuel-based heat inside larger furnaces — a step known as “electric boosting.”
Facilities that make high-volume products like container glass and windows are trickier to fully electrify. Existing electric designs have struggled to operate with the same consistency and flexibility as gas furnaces, and they can’t incorporate as much recycled material into the glass mix. Electric furnaces also tend to wear down and need replacing about twice as fast as their gas-burning counterparts, according to glass industry experts.
In Germany, Schott is aiming to address those problems with its new industrial-scale melting tank, which must also meet the exacting standards for bubble-free, high-quality pharmaceutical glass. The initiative, which Schott began developing in 2021, is partly funded by the German government and a European Union–backed program to decarbonize energy-intensive industries in Germany.

The company is investing in electrification in part to meet European climate regulations, including a “strategic opportunity to strengthen its competitiveness,” Spitra said.
## **An uncertain path to decarbonization**
Beyond the technical issues, a few other barriers stand in the way of electrifying glassmaking at a wider scale.
In some locations, the local grid may be unable to support a major increase in electricity use, requiring companies and utilities to upgrade that infrastructure or build more wind, solar, and other electricity resources. For producers of mass-market packaging like soda bottles, it can be harder to convince beverage companies to pay more for low-carbon glass if it means raising the sticker price of the final product, especially if the competition is cheap plastic containers.
Another challenge for U.S. glassmakers in particular is that switching to electricity very likely means paying higher utility bills, making it harder to justify ditching fossil gas.
Sonya Pump, the global sustainability director for Ohio-based O-I Glass, said that gas pricing is one of the key factors the company weighs when evaluating low-carbon furnace technologies — along with potential technical constraints or risks to its manufacturing capabilities. O-I Glass makes billions of glass containers every year in facilities in nearly 20 countries, and the criteria it considers vary by market, as well as the type and quantity of glass it’s producing.
For that reason, in the U.S., “a fully electric melter is not currently the best solution for our business,” she said. “Though, in other geographies — areas in Europe, for example — energy pricing, carbon costs, and intense interest from our customers in emerging sustainability solutions make for analyses that look very different.”
In central France, O-I Glass is 70% electricity and is set to come online in 2026. Pump said her team is also learning from its participation in electrification projects conducted through the nonprofit consortium

The manufacturer recently 47% by 2030, relative to 2019 levels, in addition to boosting its use of electricity from renewables and increasing the use of recycled glass.
O-I Glass had planned to rebuild an aging furnace in Zanesville, Ohio, and combine five cutting-edge technologies — including for electric boosting, preheating materials, and recovering waste heat — to see how much they could offset gas consumption when working together. The project was slated to receive up to $57.3 million from the DOE. Now that the federal funding 
Other initiatives to electrify glassmaking or test replacing gas with hydrogen are also now “slightly paused” under the Trump administration, said Matthew Kirian, director and technical program manager of the Northwest Ohio Innovation Consortium. The nonprofit works with O-I Glass and other manufacturers such as solar-panel-maker First Solar to advance innovation within the region’s long-standing glass industry.
“On the energy and fuel side of things, it’s hard to set a firm strategy, especially for the next two to three years, because of federal policy that is so clear … that combustion is king,” Kirian said.
For now, he added, glass manufacturers are largely focusing on other strategies to lessen their environmental impact, including improving the energy efficiency and operating performance of existing facilities and working to increase recycling rates for glass containers — only 
“Their sustainability goals aren’t going away,” Kirian said of the glassmakers. “We’re hoping to really move the needle for generations to come.”","Clean industry, Electrification, Emissions reduction",glassmaking-heat-decarbonization-electric-furnaces.md,articles_clean-industry

A Chicago-area startup says its technology could shave emissions from the global metal industry by allowing companies to recycle grimy metal slivers and sludge left over from steel and aluminum production.
Steel and aluminum production account for about [Decarbonizing the sector](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/decarbonizing-steel-and-concrete-were-in-the-age-of-urgency) is expected to be a huge and costly undertaking, involving the overhaul of industrial processes more than a century old and the retrofitting of sprawling mills.
“You’ve got a company throwing something away, in some cases paying to throw it away because it’s contaminated with toxic materials. [Sun Metalon is] offering a way to create value from that,” said Nick Yavorsky, senior associate for the climate-aligned industries program at the clean energy nonprofit RMI, which is providing Sun Metalon 18 months of mentorship as part of its 
On May 21, the company announced it had raised a total of 
Sun Metalon's units extract recyclable metal from waste streams that would otherwise be sent to a landfill. (Sun Metalon)
The great majority of steel and aluminum in the U.S. is made from recycled metal, not raw ore. That’s fortunate, since creating this recycled metal emits much less carbon emissions than forging it from scratch. And that means increasing the amount of metal that can be recycled is one means of decarbonizing the industry.
“Some companies are looking at making steel in a new way, fully electrified,” as opposed to powered by coke, an energy-dense substance derived from coal, Yavorsky said. “Maybe there is not as much sexiness around folks reducing demand [for new steel], thinking about alternative materials. Yet these often are the fastest and most direct way to reduce emissions.”
## **Hot boxes: How Sun Metalon’s tech works**
Sun Metalon CEO and co-founder Kazuhiko Nishioka said he got the idea for the technology while working at Nippon Steel and studying for a PhD at Northwestern University near Chicago with Nippon’s support. In 2021, he and two colleagues at Nippon founded the company as they did DIY experiments to clean up tiny scraps too contaminated with oil or other substances to be recycled.
They received two patents on the heating technology in 2024. Sun Metalon’s units are modular “ovens” that can be placed on a factory or foundry floor; the metal waste fed into them is basically cleaned with intense heat and turned into “pucks” or “coins” that can be recycled in metal-making processes.
“We apply our heating, evaporate fluids, condense [impurities] back to liquid, and collect it,” explained Nishioka, noting the process involves reaching the boiling point of oil. The whole thing is powered by electricity, making it carbon-free if renewable energy is available.
“Sometimes scrap has a negative value, especially for sludges — no one can recycle it, so they have to pay for disposal,” he said. “We can bring it up to best or second best” in the value chain of recycled metal feedstock. “Then the profit can be shared among customers.”
Sun Metalon's technology turns waste into pucks that can be recycled in metal-making processes. (Sun Metalon) 
The pucks can be sold to electric arc furnaces — essentially steel mills making recycled steel — or other metal recycling operations. Or they can be used onsite; for example, a car factory could channel metal waste from one part of the production line back into making new engine blocks.
“We are reducing new metal, and secondly, we are reducing logistics — nobody has to come pick it up” in diesel-burning trucks, said Nishioka.
Iulian Bobe joined Sun Metalon as chief strategy officer after co-founding a textile recycling company called Circ. He said steel and aluminum manufacturers are very eager to reduce their waste streams and their emissions; meanwhile, in Europe, decarbonization mandates drive demand.
“They’re really trying to get to a situation where they have zero landfill,” Bobe said. “They’re looking for solutions that can be implemented in the factories. You really don’t want to haul all that waste to another location. Our solution is very modular — we can put it on the site, achieving the circularity.”
## **Major companies get on board for testing**
Sun Metalon says it has received a total of $40 million from investors. Both Toyota Motor Co. and the construction equipment manufacturer Komatsu have purchased its equipment, tested it in their facilities, and promised to work with Sun Metalon to scale up the technology.
A “a difficult-to-handle mixture of fine metal particles, oil, and water.”
Each year, Komatsu produces 150 tons of the sludge, which is hard to safely melt and recycle, according to the release — but Sun Metalon could change that.
“This endeavor not only promises significant resource conservation and waste treatment cost reductions but also aligns with broader decarbonization efforts in metal processing,” says the press release.

In recent weeks, President Donald Trump has expressed his [support for an acquisition](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/green-steel/nippon-us-deal-trump-coal) that would 
The Recycled Materials Association, a trade group that represents metal recycling, noted that over 70% of steel and 80% of aluminum in the U.S. is made from recycled material.
“Compared to the processing and transportation needed for mining, drilling, harvesting, or other methods of extracting natural resources for manufacturing, the use of recycled materials typically produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions,” Rachel Bookman, a spokesperson for the organization, said by email.
The trade association declined to comment specifically about Sun Metalon, which is one of its members.
## **A CEO’s vision for the future of metals**
Nishioka said the technology could be useful for “automotive and aerospace, construction machinery, any product using metal,” adding that he plans to pitch to steel mills and foundries in the Midwest and South.
“Any process melting metal can benefit,” he continued, “either companies that are melting metal or companies purchasing from those companies.”
Nishioka imagines that with more innovation, the modular technology could be used not only to prepare metal for recycling but to actually create metal products. 
He’s also hopeful that new industrial processes could spur manufacturing in developing nations, an idea inspired by his time volunteering in Kenya as an undergraduate student.
“My original vision was to bring compact steelmaking processes into a couple different boxes,” he said. “We can bring those boxes wherever we want. It could be in Africa, or on Mars.”","Clean industry, Clean aluminum, Green steel, Midwest, Illinois",sun-metalon-steel-aluminum-recycling.md,articles_clean-industry

The Department of Energy 3.7 billion in funding for projects that would cut carbon emissions and toxic air pollution from power plants and industrial sites, ranging from cement kilns to ketchup-processing plants.
The DOE shared [a list of the projects to be cut](https://assets.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/DOE-OCED-terminations-May-29-2025.pdf) with Canary Media on Friday, which showed that more than half of the awards under the ambitious Industrial Demonstrations Program, housed under the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, will be terminated. OCED funding focused on carbon capture at gas-fired power plants is also impacted.
DOE claimed the projects “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable, and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”
But advocates disagree. Not only would the projects kickstart efforts to clean up industries that are notoriously tricky to decarbonize — they would have generated serious economic benefits, too.
Analyses from groups including the OCED would have created hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide and helped position U.S. industries to compete in international markets that are increasingly demanding cleaner materials and products.
Stakeholders have for months [expected the Trump administration](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/oced-demonstrations-grants-cuts-trump) to cut the OCED awards, which were authorized under the Biden administration by the 2021 [bipartisan infrastructure law](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/how-the-infrastructure-bill-will-fight-climate-change-and-advance-clean-energy) and the 2022 [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.canarymedia.com/inflation-reduction-act-follow-canarys-coverage).

Today’s announcement doesn’t include any hydrogen-hub funding cuts. But the feared elimination of money for carbon capture and industrial decarbonization has become a reality.
The Trump administration is getting rid of funding for several efforts to [decarbonize the production of cement](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/the-clean-cement-projects-getting-1-5b-in-biden-admin-funds), one of the most carbon-intensive industries in the world. That includes 500 million grant to take a multi-technology approach to cutting emissions from its plant in Lebec, California.
The DOE is also pulling funding for projects to replace fossil-fueled industrial heating equipment with [heat pumps, electric boilers, and thermal energy storage](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/new-doe-backed-projects-tackle-factory-emissions-with-heat-pumps-and-more) systems.

What remains unclear is the extent to which Friday’s cancellations have disrupted ongoing construction, hiring of workers, or other unrecoverable commitments from companies impacted. Firms have been tight-lipped about plans to navigate the consequences of federal funding clawbacks. All of the awards required participating companies to invest at least as much as they were set to receive in federal grants.
A representative of Sublime Systems told Canary Media that the company was “surprised and disappointed” by DOE’s decision to cut its grant. Sublime this week 600,000 tons of [the low-carbon cement to be produced](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/sublime-systems-low-carbon-cement-goes-commercial) from the startup’s DOE’s grant.
“It is our hope to continue to partner with the DOE to show a success story of American innovation and ingenuity at its finest,” Sublime’s representative said in a Friday email. “Nevertheless, we have prepared for the possibility of this disappointing outcome and are evaluating various scenarios that leave our scale-up unimpeded.”
The projects are without a doubt now on far shakier financial footing, and advocates do not expect that they’ll be able to move forward without the federal funding. Should they fail, the effects would be profound, according to Evan Gillespie, a partner at advocacy group Industrious Labs.
“[The projects] would have helped catapult the U.S. into a leadership position in the technologies that will bring down emissions and pace the next generation of industrial evolution,” he said. “Killing these projects means more emissions, more pollution, and more people getting sick.”

Industrial decarbonization advocates pushed back.
“This program could have been a centerpiece of achieving the administration’s goal to bring manufacturing back to the United States,” Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said in a Friday statement. “Choosing to cancel these awards is shortsighted, and I think we’re going to look back at this moment with regret. Locking domestic plants into outdated technology is not a recipe for future competitiveness or bringing manufacturing jobs back to American communities.”","Clean industry, Policy regulation, Politics",trump-cut-funding-oced.md,articles_clean-industry

President Donald Trump vowed to bring industrial manufacturing back to the United States. But in the coming weeks, his administration plans to gut a key program at the Department of Energy that [promised to rapidly revitalize domestic production](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/biden-admin-invests-6b-to-cut-carbon-from-steel-cement-and-snacks) of materials such as cement, aluminum, and steel.
Slashing funding and staffing at the Energy Department’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations — and all but [eliminating its Industrial Demonstrations Program (IDP)](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/bidens-6b-bid-to-clean-up-heavy-industry-at-risk-under-trump) — threatens the creation of nearly 300,000 jobs nationwide, according to an IDP, a 
It’s unclear exactly how deep the cuts, which were initiated by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), will go. A leaked list of projects slated for cancellation that Canary Media obtained last month did not include a $500 million award to [build a giant new smelter](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-aluminum/a-new-green-aluminum-plant-could-bring-jobs-and-clean-energy-to-kentucky) powered by carbon-free energy, suggesting that particular project might survive, even as most of the IDP’s other investments face likely termination.
The White House released a “would not impact any currently awarded projects.”
That could mean only three of the IDP’s 29 projects — the ones funded under that legislation — will be spared: Ørsted’s $100 million grant to 189 million project to 
The remaining 26 IDP projects, which are funded through the Inflation Reduction Act, are likely on the chopping block. That includes the $500 million grant to upgrade the aging blast furnaces at steel giant Cleveland-Cliffs’ plant in Middletown, Ohio — Vice President JD Vance’s hometown.
If the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations is shuttered, Ohio stands to lose $391 million in economic activity and 2,400 jobs, the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions found. Indiana would be out $672 million and 3,246 jobs. Texas, meanwhile, would miss out on $592 million in spending and roughly 3,800 jobs.
“These are fairly conservative numbers, and it’s still very alarming in terms of the sheer scale of investment and job loss that we’re talking about,” said Brad Townsend, the Ohio-based vice president of policy and outreach at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. “These are the very manufacturing jobs that the administration is rightfully prioritizing. It’s inexplicable if the goal is to try to revitalize American manufacturing.”
Even if the administration reverses course and ultimately releases the money, Townsend said the dollars won’t go as far because the delay will cost companies interest.
“A good analogy here would be: If you went to your financial adviser and they said, ‘We’re going to pull 50% of your retirement out and sit on it for the next six months or a year, and you’re not going to make any returns at the time,’ most of us would be pretty angry about that,” he said. “This is, in effect, what’s happening to the entire U.S. economy.”
Unlike other federal investments that are estimated to take a decade or more to pan out, IDP’s projects average a predicted completion time of 4.5 years, according to former officials at the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and data from the leaked spreadsheets of projects. IDP was on track to distribute all its funds by September 2026.
“We told folks they needed to have shovels in the ground and be ready,” said a former IDP official who spoke to Canary Media on condition of anonymity. 
Given another six months to advance the program, the official said, “these projects would have gotten far enough that the new administration wouldn’t be able to unwind them.”
“The administration should be seeing this as a feather in their cap, because the program definitely aligns with their priorities,” the former official said.
The cuts appear to be the result of DOGE trouncing its rival political factions within the new administration at the Energy Department, who may have recognized the value of federal investments in industrial projects, said Hilary Lewis, the steel director at the climate advocacy nonprofit Industrious Labs.
“Who would want these plants closed? Maybe the coal industry? The coal industry isn’t lobbying for killing these projects, but they stand to benefit if we get in the way of innovation and technology improvements,” she said. “Practically and politically speaking, though, the group that’s trying to stop this is DOGE. They’re just trying to cut all federal funding, no matter how much good it does.”
If MAGA’s pro-development wing had hoped DOGE’s mission would wind down once its billionaire leader turned his attention back to his private-sector duties at Tesla, SpaceX, and X, the recent shakeup of top staff at the Energy Department implies otherwise. Last week, Energy Secretary Chris Wright DOGE for its first 100 days, to chief of staff.
Some projects may still survive without federal funding, even if timelines get pushed back.
IDP grant recipients with deep balance sheets and easy access to capital could fund their own projects. Exxon Mobil Corp., for example, has made the low-carbon hydrogen plant at its Baytown, Texas, refinery 250,000 metric tons of low-carbon ammonia to Japanese firm Marubeni. Without the nearly $332 million the IDP promised the oil giant, however, the project may take longer to complete.
But a startup such as Skyven Technologies may struggle to build the nation’s first 145 million the IDP offered.
Few states have the capacity to replace the federal funding on their own, said Archie Fraser, who leads research on decarbonization and energy efficiency for the industrial team at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
“The Industrial Demonstrations Program is a unique and exciting federal program that I think a lot of the states are not necessarily positioned to continue if the funding goes away,” he said.
Even with federal support, the U.S. has lagged far behind China in subsidizing new industrial plants. Just last year, China launched nearly twice the number of low-carbon industrial demonstration projects as the IDP funded. This year, Beijing rolled out a second batch of more than 100 new projects.
“It’s hard to overstate how much these cuts really undermine the administration’s stated mission of outcompeting China,” said Marcela Mulholland, a former official at the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations who now leads advocacy at the nonpartisan climate group Clean Tomorrow. “While we’re fighting about DOGE, China is barreling forward.”
She added, “It’s bleak.”

Advanced transmission technologies that utilities must contemplate under HB 15 include things like sensors that allow lines to safely carry more electricity when conditions are favorable, a concept known as [dynamic line rating](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/better-real-time-data-for-the-countrys-congested-transmission-lines). Digital controllers can [remotely adjust](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/how-digitizing-the-transmission-grid-can-enable-the-energy-mix-of-the-future) the amount of power flowing through different parts of the grid, while [topology optimization software](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/new-software-can-find-more-room-for-clean-energy-on-transmission-grid) can reroute power around congested areas, like a navigation app for electricity.
A key benefit of these technologies is that they can be used with existing infrastructure. When wires do need to be replaced, [advanced conductors](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/startup-nabs-60m-for-high-tech-cables-to-help-speed-clean-energy-rollout) provide an energy-saving option. Those conductors use carbon composites or other materials to carry more electricity with less loss of that energy, compared to traditional wires of similar diameter.
A high-tech approach can create space on the grid for more renewable energy to come online. That would lessen the need to run expensive, polluting coal-fired power plants, said Rob Kelter, a senior attorney with the Environmental Law Policy Center, a legal advocacy organization based in the Midwest.
Besides helping to mitigate climate change, less pollution would help people’s health as well, Tavenor said.
Under HB 15, owners of high-voltage power lines must file annual reports showing which advanced transmission technologies they considered as part of their five-year forecasts. Those companies will also need to identify areas of the grid with congestion, and compare the cost of addressing it with traditional versus advanced technologies.
The reports will be available to the public, and interested parties may ask the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to hold a hearing on whether utilities properly reported transmission information and whether they should be able to recover costs from customers.
The Ohio Power Siting Board must also require companies to consider technology solutions before it approves any new transmission projects. Companies would have to file reports and expert testimony to support any decision to forego advanced technologies in favor of conventional projects, Kelter said.
Advocacy groups and other stakeholders “would have a chance to similarly argue that those technologies are available and that they’re cost-effective, and that they would be able to alleviate congestion and delay the need for new transmission lines,” Kelter added.
The law requires the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to study the costs and benefits of the various technologies, including how to streamline their deployment. That report will be due by March 1 next year.
Some Ohio utilities have already been exploring the potential for advanced transmission technologies. In 2023, AES installed 42 dynamic-line-rating sensors at towers along five transmission lines owned by its Ohio and Indiana utilities. The companies 
American Transmission Systems, a subsidiary of FirstEnergy, is planning to spend nearly $900 million on “We are currently reviewing House Bill 15 and exploring how its provisions around advanced transmission technologies could be integrated into our planning to strengthen the power grid for Ohio customers,” said FirstEnergy spokesperson Lauren Siburkis.
Many of the law’s potential benefits hinge on how the Ohio Power Siting Board and Public Utilities Commission of Ohio implement its terms when making decisions on siting and electric rates, Tavenor noted.
The law’s advanced technology provisions only apply to high-voltage parts of the grid that move electricity over long distances. It doesn’t require utilities to consider high-tech approaches to improving the local distribution lines that deliver electricity to homes and businesses.
So, for example, AEP Ohio won’t need to consider advanced transmission technologies in its 30, spokesperson Laura Arenschield said. That’s because AEP wants to use the 2.14% increase in base rates to pay for improvements to its local distribution system, not the AEP transmission network.
Similarly, the new law won’t address [grid inequities](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/ohio-grid-investment-disparities-firstenergy) affecting disadvantaged communities in FirstEnergy’s Ohio territory, which the Interstate Renewable Energy Council described in a 
Even so, investments that use existing system capacity more effectively can still promote equity by reducing the need to build all-new transmission lines. Siting such infrastructure “can be incredibly invasive and inequitable, harming both communities and ecosystems,” said report author Shay Banton, who is a regulatory program engineer and energy justice policy advocate at the Interstate Renewable Energy Council.
Building less brand-new transmission can also save consumers money. Ohioans have generally paid for transmission maintenance and upgrades through a “rider” on their bills. For the average AEP Ohio consumer, that extra charge is HB 15, however, aims to get rid of single-issue riders, so in the future, utilities will instead have to consider transmission costs through rate cases that consider all utility costs and expenses and are heavily scrutinized by regulators. That could also lead to lower costs or at least smaller increases.
“Ohio utility consumers already are burdened by billions in utility transmission projects,” said Maureen Willis, who represents the interests of Ohio’s utility customers in her role as the state’s consumers’ counsel. “By adopting advanced transmission technology, these costs can be reduced, staving off unnecessary ‘[gold-plating](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/ohios-powerforward-roadmap-aims-to-shape-the-grid-of-the-future)’ by utilities, giving consumers more bang for the buck. We strongly advocate for this approach to transmission spending.”","Transmission, Clean energy, Policy regulation, Midwest, Ohio",ohio-law-grid-technology.md,articles_transmission

Martin Heinrich demands answers from the Trump admin on its “illegal” move to claw back $4.9 billion for the Grain Belt Express transmission project.

The Trump administration recently [terminated a $4.9 billion loan](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/grain-belt-express-trump-loan-canceled) for the Grain Belt Express, the country’s biggest transmission grid project. Sen. Martin Heinrich, Democrat from New Mexico, says the decision is illegal.
In an exclusive new interview with Canary Media, Heinrich discusses why he’s demanding that the Department of Energy account for the decision — and what response he’s received.
Last month, Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, DOE challenging its vague excuse for cutting off the legally binding contract between the federal government and Invenergy, the Chicago-based energy project developer planning to build the power-line project from Kansas to Illinois.
“Not only am I concerned that this move is illegal,” Heinrich wrote — a DOE Loan Programs Office, which issued the conditional loan guarantee in the waning days of the Biden administration. “I am concerned that the federal government is eroding what little trust the private sector has in our ability to be reliable partners.”
That trust is eroding rapidly, Heinrich said. The project has been in the works for more than a decade and is one of only a handful of major transmission developments underway in the United States.
The Grain Belt Express would support gigawatts’ worth of new wind and solar projects — energy sources that are under attack by the Trump administration.
The new GOP [megalaw](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/senates-big-beautiful-bill-would-be-a-disaster-for-clean-energy) is expected to cut new solar, wind, and battery deployments [96% of the new energy capacity](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-96-percent-of-new-us-power-capacity-was-carbon-free-in-2024) being added to the U.S. grid.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration has unleashed a 
The move to block the Grain Belt Express is part of this broader attempt to slow renewable energy — just when the country can least afford it, Heinrich said.
_This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity._
**Why did you decide to write the letter to Energy Secretary Chris Wright?**
Secretary Wright, before he was secretary, said numerous times to our committee [the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources] that he was going to follow the law, and a conditional loan guarantee is a legally binding commitment.
It’s as if you go to your bank and you get preapproved for a mortgage, then when you show up for the closing, you expect the bank to make good on that. And that’s what we had here.
The reality is, we need this administration to follow the law and make good on commitments that have been made so that there is predictability in the market. We also need every cheap electron we can get right now, and so if you put these big infrastructure projects in jeopardy, what you’re really doing is passing along more costs to consumers.
**Have you received any response from DOE?**
Not yet.
**Do you expect you’ll eventually get a response?**
I certainly expect to. And if the secretary wants to be taken seriously by the Senate, then he needs to provide that information.
One of the things that really bothers me about a lot of the actions that the Department of Energy and the Department of Interior are taking right now is the sum total is creating a lot of uncertainty in the finance markets, and that flows through to create additional costs for consumers.
When you have a big transmission project like this one, there are $52 billion in energy savings over the course of the next decade, and that should be accruing to consumers. And if you put all of this in jeopardy, the real impact is that costs are going up, and then when you put all of these permits that are usually very predictable and are now uncertain, all of this is going to raise costs for consumers — for retail consumers and for commercial consumers. We’re already seeing electric rates start to rise, and I am deeply concerned that that is going to get a lot worse in the coming years because of their actions and their inactions.
**You asked the department if it had analyzed the impact of canceling the loan guarantee. What do you see as the administration’s responsibility in analyzing its actions on energy policy in terms of affordability? And are they fulfilling those responsibilities?**
They are not. And it doesn’t take a detailed analysis to understand that, in an environment of surging demand, if you artificially constrain supply, you’re going to be raising costs for people. And I want the American people to know that this is not an accident. They are choosing to take actions which are raising people’s electric bills.
**Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican representing Iowa, has said he****until there’s some response from the administration regarding its actions on wind and solar tax credits. Can you tell us more about where members of Congress have power to challenge how the administration is managing energy policy?**
Well, I think the confirmation process is one obvious place. This is an administration that has been very public about saying that they need more people in place to be able to execute their agenda. But unless they’re responsive to the Congress, that process is not going to speed up.
**You asked the DOE for a list of all the **[**closed loans and conditional commitments**](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/heres-every-biden-era-energy-loan-now-all-under-threat-from-trump)**that the department is reviewing. Have you received any response?**
I’ll be honest, they have not been particularly transparent or responsive on many of these issues, and that is a trend that I think does not bode well for the next several years.
Having been through a 17-year process to get one transmission line built [the SunZia line in New Mexico and Arizona], I’m also acutely aware of the jobs that hang in the balance. We’re talking about thousands and thousands of good, high-quality American jobs that are simply not going to come to fruition because this administration has a political agenda. I’ve never seen an administration so insensitive to the job implications of their actions.","**closed loans and conditional commitments**, Transmission, Clean energy, Politics",doe-is-raising-power-bills-by-thwarting-transmission-line-heinrich-says.md,articles_transmission
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/voters-want-bigger-grid-cheap-reliable-energy,"Majority of Americans want a big power grid and more cheap, clean energy",17 September 2025,Kathiann M. Kowalski,"A new Conservative Energy Network poll found that two-thirds of likely voters support more transmission lines to boost clean energy and grid reliability. 
The U.S. does not have a big enough power grid to accommodate rising energy demand — a fact that’s making electricity less affordable and reliable nationwide.
But there’s broad public support for growing the grid and allowing more electricity, including cheap, clean energy, to come online.
So says a [severely backlogged](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-markets/pjm-rising-costs-interconnection-reform) PJM Interconnection grid region — and Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri, which are covered by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO). The survey was conducted by polling firm Cygnal on behalf of the Conservative Energy Network.
Roughly three-fourths of likely voters support expanding the electric grid, the survey found. About two-thirds are in favor of adding more transmission lines to connect clean energy and strengthen grid reliability.
And nearly 90% of respondents are concerned about rising energy costs. A majority of surveyed Republicans, Democrats, and Independents said they are “very concerned.”
“This is not a partisan issue. … You don’t have to appeal to one side or another,” said Chris Lane, a senior partner at Cygnal, who previewed the findings at the [National Conservative Energy Summit](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/conservatives-oppose-government-renewables-restrictions) in Cleveland on Aug. 25.
He noted that the results stand out for their consistency between regions and among different groups — including political parties. Even so, the Trump administration has in recent months worked against grid expansion, not toward it.
## **Adding more “lanes” to the grid**
Energy costs are climbing in part because of rising power demand [from data centers](https://www.canarymedia.com/boon-or-bane-what-will-data-centers-do-to-the-grid) and the electrification of buildings and vehicles. Bringing more electricity generation online — especially quick-to-build, low-cost wind and solar — could increase competition and lower prices under the basic principles of supply and demand.
But just as transportation planners need to make sure highways can handle increased road traffic, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and regional transmission operators need to make sure the grid has room for more electrons. That calls for more “lanes” in the form of [added transmission lines](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/plans-to-expand-the-grid-are-finally-underway-will-trump-drop-the-ball), plus technologies to squeeze more capacity out of the system overall.
Currently, “there aren’t enough power lines, they’re not all in the right places, and the ones we have are too outdated to meet the rising power demand for electricity,” Evelyn Robinson, director of PJM affairs for the renewable-energy industry group MAREC Action, said during a separate panel at the conference in Cleveland.
While all of the United States faces delays in getting new energy onto the grid, the problem is worst in the PJM region, where hundreds of projects have been stalled in the queue for years. To deal with the backlog, the grid operator switched to a new interconnection process in 2023; as of June, PJM still had about “transition queue.”
Across the country, wind, solar, and battery storage make up most of the resources waiting to come online, and their “levelized cost of energy” is cheaper or on par with other electricity sources.
The Trump administration has called for “the [grid-enhancing technologies](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/ohio-law-grid-technology), “by easing Federal regulatory burdens.”
But the administration’s actions have so far had the opposite effect. A February 4.9 billion loan guarantee for the Grain Belt Express — the largest transmission line underway in the United States. The project aims to shuttle [gigawatts of wind and solar power](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/grain-belt-express-trump-loan-canceled) from the Great Plains to the East, and Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., has called the cancellation of its federal loan guarantee [illegal](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/doe-is-raising-power-bills-by-thwarting-transmission-line-heinrich-says).
The administration’s policies, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, are also expected to [more than halve](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/electricity-prices-rising-trump-impact) the amount of clean energy built over the next decade, further exacerbating concerns about soaring power prices and rising demand.
## **What’s on voters’ minds**
The survey results may help the Conservative Energy Network convince decision makers to take steps to expand the grid.
“To the best of my knowledge, this is the first poll that’s been done in the PJM area testing these things, and in the MISO south area,” said John Szoka, the group’s CEO, at the National Conservative Energy Summit.
The polling also gauged the persuasiveness of four statements to support grid expansion. The takeaways could inform how advocates and legislators work to boost public support for clean energy.
Among conservatives in Ohio and Pennsylvania, a message focused on lower costs was about 12 times more likely to shift someone’s opinion than one about preventing blackouts, Lane noted. Messages about increasing American energy production, preventing blackouts, and providing positive job and economic impacts for Americans were more likely to move liberals than one about lowering costs.
Opinions were more divided on whether the federal government, states, or private companies should pay for grid expansion, although a slight majority of respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas said they would be willing to pay a few dollars more per month in the short term if it would reduce outages and lower costs over time.
Respondents were also mixed on who should get to choose how electricity is produced. States, landowners, and local officials all ranked above federal authorities.
Clean energy, meanwhile, received only modest support on its own. About one-fourth of the Ohio and Pennsylvania respondents said using clean energy was one of their top two policy goals, with nearly one-fifth of those surveyed in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri giving that response.
Ultimately, affordability and reliability were the clear consensus energy policy priorities for poll respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas. 
With the federal government standing in the way of both grid expansion and clean energy development, however, it will be tough for the voters to get the improvements they want.","Transmission, Clean energy, Politics",voters-want-bigger-grid-cheap-reliable-energy.md,articles_transmission
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/north-carolina-duke-grid-technology,North Carolina eyes grid-enhancing tech to improve aging power lines,15 May 2025,Elizabeth Ouzts,"Regulators are prodding utility Duke Energy to deploy cutting-edge tools like dynamic line rating and carbon composite conductors to improve transmission.

Last summer, utility Duke Energy joined U.S. and state officials to announce with fanfare 
Funded jointly by the federal government and Duke, the project highlighted how advanced technology can help solve the problems posed by an aging electric grid: It will include cables better able to withstand extreme weather and modern support structures that can accommodate new sources of power.
“The grant announced today by the Department of Energy is a win for the communities Duke Energy serves, and signals North Carolina’s leadership in the energy transition,” Kendal Bowman, president of the utility’s North Carolina operations, said at the time.
But advocates and experts say the Lee-Milburnie transmission line in Eastern North Carolina is just the tip of the iceberg. To save consumers money and meet growing energy demand, they believe policymakers should follow other states’ lead and encourage Duke to perform many more grid upgrades like the one unveiled last summer.
Bipartisan legislation that would do just that failed to meet a key deadline last week, but its contents could still end up in another bill before the session ends later this year. Backers of the measure remain hopeful, in part because it would benefit all energy sources, not just renewable ones.
“It’s not a clean energy bill,” said Mel Mackin, state policy director for the nonprofit advocacy group Ceres. “It’s a grid-modernization bill. It’s about upgrading transmission lines to improve efficiency, to improve reliability. It’s about reducing grid congestion. We’re hopeful legislators will see it that way.”
## **A congested electricity highway**
In North Carolina, as across the country, the transmission grid — the network of high-voltage lines designed to transport electrons across long distances — faces a confluence of challenges. For one thing, the grid is old: about 70% of today’s transmission lines were installed at least 35 years ago.
These aging conductors have much less capacity than newer ones, said North Carolina-based Maureen Quinlan, senior officer for energy modernization at The Pew Charitable Trusts. Old lines are also susceptible to failure from normal wear and tear as well as from extreme weather events like hurricanes and heat waves, causing “road closures” on the electricity highway.
“An element of the grid may go out, and you have to reroute the power,” Quinlan explained. “Detours are always going to be slower; you’re on smaller roads. That’s going to create inefficiencies.”
The resulting grid congestion from existing, interconnected power suppliers is one “today problem,” said Quinlan. A 11.5 billion nationwide in 2023 because they force utilities looking to avoid congested areas to dispatch more expensive electricity than they otherwise would.
A second challenge for the present is the long line of projects waiting to merge onto the clogged highway that is the transmission grid. In North Carolina and throughout the Southeast, that “interconnection queue” is dominated by solar farms and battery storage.
As Duke and other utilities race to build power plants of all kinds to supply [large data centers](https://www.canarymedia.com/boon-or-bane-what-will-data-centers-do-to-the-grid), manufacturing plants, electric vehicles, and more, the queue is poised to lengthen until the road is widened — that is, until the grid’s capacity is expanded.
“You already have a system that’s experiencing a lot of these constraints and backlogs,” said Quinlan. “That’s going to be compounded by growing energy demand.”
Addressing today’s bottlenecks helps utilities save money to address a hurdle for tomorrow: building brand new highways to bring large sources of energy, such as offshore wind, to population centers, such as the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area known as The Triangle.
That’s why experts are increasingly looking to advanced transmission technologies, which can quickly be added to the existing grid to allow it to carry more power.
“They can be deployed in a matter of months to a few years,” said Quinlan, “and they’re also very cost-effective. [Some] can pay for themselves in less than six months, so they’re seen as a bridge to these bigger transmission grid-level needs.”
The technologies include both hardware and software. [Carbon composite conductors](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/startup-nabs-60m-for-high-tech-cables-to-help-speed-clean-energy-rollout), for instance, are up to twice as efficient as traditional aluminum cables reinforced with steel, in part because they sag less when overheated. These modern lines are a key reason the Lee-Milburnie upgrade is expected to reduce the length of service interruptions by 10%.
Through a process called [dynamic line rating](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/better-real-time-data-for-the-countrys-congested-transmission-lines), utilities can place sensors on lines to assess temperature, wind speed, and other factors, allowing significantly more power to flow under favorable conditions.
Installing advanced hardware is more economical than building new conventional transmission lines because it offers more bang for the buck, doesn’t involve new rights-of-way, and reuses some existing infrastructure. One recent study found that replacing conventional lines with advanced conductors nationwide would “reconductoring” would also save $85 billion by 2035 compared to business as usual.
The Lee-Milburnie line, for instance, will allow 1,600 megawatts of solar and 260 megawatts of energy storage to connect to the grid in Eastern North Carolina. Duke also told regulators the project 
Advanced software technologies are also money-savers. A pair of studies from Quanta Technologies and The Brattle Group shows such software could reduce energy costs nationwide by over $5 billion annually, a former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission “a policy vacuum” in the U.S. is holding back adoption.
## **Filling the policy vacuum**
From Arizona to Maine, there’s growing bipartisan interest around the country in filling that void. Just this week, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, signed a bill requiring utilities to report on their advanced transmission efforts.
Advocates made some headway in North Carolina last November, when the state Utilities Commission 
Regulators wrote in their decision that they believe that grid-enhancing technologies “can be used to overcome interconnection limits, address transmission outage challenges, and interconnect resources while transmission system upgrades are being constructed.”
Commissioners ordered that Duke’s next plan, a draft of which is due in September, report on the utility’s progress toward implementing such technologies, including explanations for not proceeding with any grid enhancements it evaluated.
Legislation sponsored by Rep. Kyle Hall, a Stokes County Republican who co-chairs the House Energy and Public Utilities Committee, would set that directive into law. 
“That makes it more durable,” said Cassie Gavin, director of policy at the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association.
The proposed legislation, 
Gavin’s group has long supported energy efficiency, she said, and promoting advanced transmission technologies is a logical next step.
“This is like energy efficiency for the grid,” she said. “And it can benefit ratepayers at the same time, so it seems like a no-brainer.”
Still, HB 814 as written 8. The bill also has yet to be discussed by a single legislative committee.
Duke, which holds significant sway in the Republican-controlled legislature, hasn’t taken a public stand on the legislation.
However, the utility has previously expressed concern about challenges posed by grid-enhancement technologies. During its planning process last year, the company told regulators that such tools could “contribute to operational complexities and reduced situational awareness.”
Asked recently about Duke’s position, a company spokesperson told Canary Media: “We appreciate the importance of discussions around ensuring safe and reliable power infrastructure to serve our customers in North Carolina and will continue to work with policymakers and other state leaders toward that goal.”
Official legislative deadlines notwithstanding, North Carolina lawmakers often combine an array of energy policies into one grand compromise bill; that’s how they passed the state’s bipartisan climate law in 2021. So, advocates remain hopeful that if there’s enough political will, there will be a way.
“We’re cautiously optimistic,” said Quinlan. “We look forward to finding a path forward to promote [advanced transmission technologies] in the state as part of its energy future.”","Transmission, Policy regulation, Utilities, Southeast, North Carolina",north-carolina-duke-grid-technology.md,articles_transmission

The Grain Belt Express has been in the works for more than a decade. It’s one of only a handful of major transmission projects underway in the U.S., and once built it will be able to support the development of gigawatts of new wind and solar projects and deliver $52 billion in energy cost savings over 15 years, according to Invenergy, the Chicago-based developer that’s building it. Around the country, more projects like the Grain Belt Express are needed to expand the grid fast enough to meet surging demand and to bolster electricity reliability.
The cancellation comes a week after Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, DOE to do so.
“He said, ‘Well, let’s just resolve this now,’” Hawley told The New York Times. “So he got Chris Wright on the line right there.”

Solar, wind, and batteries have made up [more than 90% of new energy](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-96-percent-of-new-us-power-capacity-was-carbon-free-in-2024) built in recent years, and are the only resources that can be constructed rapidly enough to meet surging demand in the near term. Other energy resources have far slower development times, including fossil-gas power plants, which currently face manufacturing bottlenecks that will take years to resolve.
In addition to headwinds from Trump and the GOP-led Congress, which just [eliminated federal tax credits](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/wind-solar-construction-trump-tax-credits) for solar and wind, the main factor that threatens to hold back clean-energy development is a lack of space on the grid.

It’s common for large-scale transmission projects, which traverse hundreds of miles across many different municipalities, counties, and states, to get bogged down in court battles. It’s a big reason why it takes so long to build new power lines in the U.S. But the Trump administration’s decision to cancel financing for the project is uncharted territory, and the impact is still unclear.
Should the project be delayed, it’d be a major setback for the U.S.’s already-sluggish transmission buildout.
The U.S. needs far more transmission to be built to lower energy costs and reduce the increasing threat of blackouts caused by extreme weather, according to reports from groups ranging from the 
Over the past decade, the number of miles of long-range, high-voltage transmission built across the country has fallen, even as [utility transmission spending has risen](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/want-larger-transmission-lines-fix-this-regulatory-gap-experts-say).

https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/trump-blocks-reap-funding-farmers,Trump admin blocks funds for farmers who want solar,22 August 2025,Kari Lydersen,"For two decades, thousands of farmers have installed money-saving solar panels with help from the federal REAP program. Trump’s USDA is choking off that resource.

The Rural Energy for America Program has for years helped thousands of American farmers pay for solar panels that lower their energy bills and earn them extra income. The Trump administration is largely putting an end to that.
The program, known as REAP, will no longer help farmers install large solar arrays on their land. Even smaller arrays could be unlikely to get funding under new restrictions on equipment made in China, as outlined in a recent internal Agriculture Department memo obtained by Canary Media.
Since 2014, the program has awarded around $1.2 billion in grants and $2.5 billion in loan guarantees for solar in rural areas nationwide, the vast majority of that on farms. Around 70% of the two-decade-old program’s funds have gone to solar projects over the last 10 years.
But on Aug. 19, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins “USDA will no longer fund taxpayer dollars for solar panels on productive farmland or allow solar panels manufactured by foreign adversaries to be used in USDA projects.”
The internal memo notes that solar projects with any of four characteristics will be ineligible for REAP loan guarantees and “disincentivized” in the point system used to award REAP grants.
Ground-mounted projects over 50 kilowatts will no longer receive loan guarantees, nor will projects on land certified as cropland by the Farm Service Agency. Loan guarantees will be denied for plots that can’t show “historical energy use,” and for “systems consisting of any component made in a country named as a foreign adversary,” according to the memo.
Large solar arrays are typically on open land that hasn’t previously consumed energy, and smaller installations powering a farm might also be in that situation, so the requirement to show historical use could be a serious blow to eligibility. And almost all solar panels include components from China, which would run afoul of the final provision.
Loan guarantees are a powerful tool for financing the utility-scale solar that provides farmers with extra revenue from selling electricity. The program comes at little cost to the federal government, since the loans are usually repaid without the financial institution needing to tap the guarantee, noted Andy Olsen, a senior policy advocate at the Environmental Law Policy Center who has extensively analyzed REAP data.
REAP grants, meanwhile, have helped farmers build smaller solar arrays that often power their farm operations and send some energy back to the grid. It’s unclear what effect disincentivizing these projects in the REAP grant scoring system will have. Such solar arrays might not trigger the first three provisions mentioned in the USDA memo, but would likely include parts made in China.
“That’s a major wrench thrown into the works,” said Olsen, noting that the USDA is “It’s highly complicated REAP because few installers know where all the components of their systems come from. They’ve raised the bar to a point where it’s nearly impossible to clear it.”
It’s the latest in a string of Trump administration actions aimed at slowing down the development of solar and other clean energy projects nationwide. In July, the Republican-led Congress [passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/tax-credit-changes-trump-law), which swiftly phases out key tax credits for the industry. Since then, the administration has issued a series of anti-renewables directives, including an 
REAP dollars [were frozen earlier this year](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/usda-solar-rural-grants-uncertainty) as part of President Donald Trump’s attack on the Inflation Reduction Act, which, along with the Farm Bill, funds REAP. The program’s funding was unfrozen in March, but then an application period scheduled for July was canceled at the last minute, raising concerns about the initiative’s future.
“I thought it might be an irrational fear a month or two ago,” said Lloyd Ritter, who helped draft REAP as senior counsel to then-U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) in the early 2000s. “But with this latest action, I’m really concerned they might continue to take steps that negate the vast benefits of the REAP program.”
While the Trump administration has framed the REAP changes as a way to preserve farmland, advocates say it will have the opposite effect.
“Farmers themselves are the ones making these decisions — they’re doing it because the economics are really beneficial to them,” said Ritter, adding that Republican-led congressional districts have received [the most funding from REAP](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/trump-rural-grants-midwest-republican-impact).
“[Trump administration officials are] making decisions that don’t really make a lot of sense from a policy perspective, and it’s bad politics to boot,” Ritter said. “They’re hurting MAGA farmers that like this stuff, and killing off economic growth across rural America.”
Meanwhile, the amount of farmland converted to solar is far less than that lost for other reasons, including 
“We know gigantic data centers are going up all over the place, mostly on prime farmland,” said Olsen. “We’ve got suburban and urban sprawl, housing developments, commercial developments — what’s the USDA doing about that? Suddenly their passion for farmland disappears when it’s anything but solar.”
Unlike those other uses, solar development can coexist with farming — by [providing farmers extra income](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/farmers-agrivoltaics-california-research) to preserve the bulk of their cropland, or through agrivoltaics wherein crops are grown or [animals graze](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/this-farmer-was-skeptical-about-solar-until-he-began-grazing-sheep) around panels.
The American Farmland Trust, a nonprofit that helps farmers preserve their land and adopt sustainable practices, ardently supports solar as a way to protect agricultural areas. Samantha Levy, the organization’s senior policy manager for conservation and energy, said that if the Trump administration really wants to help farmers, it should support those who want solar.
“American Farmland Trust has worked tirelessly to keep productive land in agriculture for over four decades,” Levy said in a statement. “We look forward to further dialogue with the administration to achieve this shared goal while ensuring that producers voluntarily seeking assistance to build solar to power their farm or ranch can still access REAP funding; and to keep productive land in farming by incentivizing agrivoltaic projects that integrate farming with solar energy generation and guiding solar to be sited on less productive land.”","Solar, Food and farms, Policy regulation",trump-blocks-reap-funding-farmers.md,articles_solar
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/balcony-panels-germany-utah,Balcony solar is all the rage in Germany. Why not in the US?,1 May 2025,Akielly Hu,"A new Utah law promoting balcony solar reveals the challenges of making the clean-energy tech mesh with the U.S. grid. 
_This_
Raymond Ward wants to see solar panels draped over every balcony in the United States and doesn’t understand why that isn’t happening.
The technology couldn’t be easier to use — simply hang one or two panels over a railing and plug them into an outlet. The devices provide up to 800 watts, enough to charge a laptop or power a small fridge. They’re 780,000 of the devices with the country’s utility regulator as of December. They’ve 
Here in the U.S., though, there is no market for balcony solar. Ward, a Republican state representative in Utah who learned about the tech last year, wants that to change. The way he sees it, this is an obvious solution to “You look over there and say, ‘Well, that’s working,’” he said. “So what is it that stops us from having it here?”
His colleagues agree. Earlier this year, the Legislature unanimously passed a bill he sponsored to boost the tech, and Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed it. “soft costs” like permits, can 
Utah’s law marks the nation’s first significant step to remove barriers to balcony solar — but bigger obstacles remain. Regulations and standards governing electrical devices haven’t kept pace with development of the technology, and it lacks essential approvals required for adoption — including compliance with the National Electrical Code and a product safety standard from Underwriters Laboratories. Nothing about the bill Ward wrote changes that: Utahans still can’t install balcony solar because none of the systems have been nationally certified.
These challenges will take time and effort to overcome, but they’re not insurmountable, advocates of the technology said. Even now, a team of entrepreneurs and research scientists, backed by federal funding, are creating these standards. Their work mirrors what happened in Germany nearly a decade ago, when clean energy advocates and companies began lobbying the country’s electrical certification body to amend safety regulations to legalize balcony solar.
In 2017, Verband der Elektrotechnik, or VDE, a German certification body that issues product and safety standards for electrical products, released the first guideline that allowed for balcony solar systems. While such systems existed before VDE took this step, the benchmark it established allowed manufacturers to sell them widely, creating a booming industry.
“Relentless individuals” were key to making that happen, said Christian Ofenheusle, the founder of EmpowerSource, a Berlin-based company that promotes balcony solar. Members of a German solar industry association spent years advocating for the technology and worked with VDE to carve a path toward standardizing balcony solar systems. The initial standard was followed by revised versions in 2018 and 2019 that further outlined technical requirements.
The regulatory structure has continued to evolve. Ofenheusle has worked with other advocates to amend grid safety standards, create simple online registration for plug-in devices, and 
Balcony solar systems feature one or two small photovoltaic panels and a microinverter and generate enough power to charge a laptop or power a small fridge. (Tobias Schwarz/AFP via Getty and Grist)
Meanwhile, the United States has yet to take the first step of creating a safety standard for the technology. U.S. electrical guidelines don’t account for the possibility of plugging a power-generating device into a household outlet. The nation also operates on a different system that precludes simply copying and pasting Germany’s rules. The U.S. grid, for example, operates at 120 volts, while that country’s grid operates at 230 volts.
Without proper standards, a balcony solar system could pose several hazards.
One concern is a phenomenon called breaker masking. Within a home, a single circuit can provide power to several outlets. Each circuit is equipped with a circuit breaker, a safety device within the electrical panel that shuts off power if that circuit is overloaded, which happens when too many appliances try to draw too much electricity at the same time. That prevents overheating or a fire. When a balcony solar device sends power into a circuit while other appliances are drawing power from the circuit, the breaker can’t detect that added power supply. If the circuit becomes overloaded — imagine turning on your TV while a space heater is running and you’re charging your laptop, all in the same room — the circuit breaker might fail to activate.
This was a concern in Germany, so it developed standards that limit balcony solar units to just 800 watts, about half the amount 
Another issue in the U.S. is the lack of a compatible safety device called a ground fault circuit interrupter, or a GFCI. They are typically built into outlets installed near water sources, like a sink, washing machine, or bathtub. They’re designed to minimize the risk of electric shock by cutting off power when, for example, a hairdryer falls into a sink. Yet there are no certified GFCI outlets in the U.S. designed for use with devices that consume power, like a blender, and those that generate it, like a balcony solar setup. Germany’s equivalent of a GFCI, called a residual current device, can detect bidirectional power flows, said Andreas Schmitz, a mechanical engineer and YouTuber in Germany who makes videos about balcony solar.
Some people have raised concerns about the shock risk of touching the metal prongs of a plug after unplugging a balcony solar device. German regulators accounted for that by requiring the microinverter — which converts currents from the panel into electricity fed into the home — shut down immediately in an outage or when it is suddenly unplugged. Most of them already have this feature, but any U.S. standard will likely need to formalize that requirement.
The lack of an Underwriters Laboratories, or UL, standard is perhaps the biggest obstacle to the adoption of balcony solar. The company certifies the safety of thousands of household electrical products; according to “every light bulb, lamp, or outlet purchased in the U.S. usually has a UL symbol and says UL Listed.” This assures customers that the product follows nationally recognized guidelines and can be used 
While some companies have sold plug-in solar devices in the U.S. without a UL listing, the company’s seal of approval typically is a prerequisite for selling products on the wider market. Consumers might be wary of using something that lacks its approval. Utah’s new balcony solar policy, for example, specifies that the law applies only to UL-listed products. 
Achim Ginsberg-Klemmt, vice president of engineering at the plug-in solar startup 2023, the Department of Energy awarded his company a grant to work with UL to develop a standard.
GismoPower sells a mobile carport with a roof of solar panels and an integrated electric vehicle charger. Unlike rooftop solar, the system doesn’t need to be mounted in place but can be rolled onto a driveway and plugged in, generating electricity for the car, house, and the grid. “We’re basically taking rooftop solar to the next level” by making it portable and accessible for renters, Ginsberg-Klemmt said. The product is in use at 
GismoPower’s product avoids one of the biggest technical challenges with balcony solar by plugging into a dedicated 240-volt outlet, the kind typically used for dryers. Such an outlet serves a single appliance and uses a dedicated circuit, sidestepping the risk of overloading. But it runs headlong into the same obstacle of lacking a compatible UL standard. Ginsberg-Klemmt is working with researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, other entrepreneurs, and engineers at Underwriters Laboratories to develop such a standard, but it hasn’t been easy. “We have found so many roadblocks,” he said.
One major sticking point is that any standard must comply with the National Electrical Code, a set of guidelines for electrical wiring in buildings that does not allow for the installation of plug-in energy systems like balcony solar. The rules are issued by the National Fire Protection Association, a nonprofit trade association, and adopted on a state-by-state basis.
The code is updated every three years, with the next iteration due later this year for the 2026 edition. Ginsberg-Klemmt and his working group submitted recommendations for amending the code to allow plug-in solar — and every one of them was rejected in October.
Jeff Sargent, the National Fire Protection Association’s staff liaison to the National Electrical Code committee, said that this is the first time the organization had received public comments about plug-in solar systems. For now, it cannot consider amendments to allow their use until a compatible ground fault circuit interrupter exists, he said. Once that’s available, he said, the association can ensure that outdoor outlets can be safely used for balcony solar.
Electrical standards are constantly evolving, and it often takes more than one cycle of code changes to allow for new products, said Sargent. Ginsberg-Klemmt said his group will continue to pursue other avenues to amend the codes.
Until that happens, a UL standard for plug-in solar is unlikely to go anywhere. But interest in plug-in energy solutions isn’t going away, and decision-makers will have to adjust to that reality eventually, Ward said. It happened in Germany, where people across the political spectrum have embraced the technology. Ward believes the same thing will happen here. The way he sees it, “It’s just a good thing if you set up a system so people have a way to take care of as much of their own problems as they can.”","Solar, Carbon-free buildings, Clean energy, Distributed energy resources, West, Utah",balcony-panels-germany-utah.md,articles_solar

The Trump administration is making it harder for low-income households to access the money-saving benefits of solar — but hard doesn’t mean impossible. 
There’s a lot for developers of affordable solar projects to navigate at the moment.
The Trump administration has clawed back billions of dollars in Inflation Reduction Act funding for projects serving low-income communities across the country, including [$7 billion for the federal “Solar for All” program](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/trump-administration-says-its-axing-7b-program-for-low-income-solar). In July, the GOP-controlled Congress passed a sweeping law that will swiftly phase out the tax credits solar developers use to bring down costs. And for months now, the administration has [held up $20 billion](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/climatetech-finance/epas-new-20b-green-bank-will-benefit-disadvantaged-communities-most) in federal green bank funding, which some organizations planned to use to make solar available to more people.
Clean energy supporters are opposing the Trump administration’s [freeze on green bank money](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/trump-admin-says-its-terminated-20b-green-bank-in-latest-escalation) in court and are expected to challenge the Solar For All clawback as well. In the meantime, the nonprofits and state agencies [planning affordable solar projects](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/trump-looks-to-kill-solar-for-all-just-as-it-starts-to-deliver) with the money are left in limbo.
Still, some developers are forging ahead.
Take John Miller and Jessica Pitts as an example. The pair, which founded 2014, is still proceeding with all 35 of their planned low-income solar projects, which will deliver a total of 17.5 megawatts of solar power to people who otherwise wouldn’t be able to access the clean energy source. Miller and Pitts think organizations like theirs can withstand Republican attacks on clean energy programs — so long as other financing and policy partners pick up the slack.
Figuring out a way to continue this work is crucial as [energy costs rise even faster](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/why-power-bills-are-rising?amp%3Butm_medium=email&%3Butm_campaign=canary&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--w3I4JBJettTq5J18AzPRFMQdH_5uViiRbIOnE9Feb8xe3-bADFr5A3GhqOprhhisY_ggQhVN_axFRXpFP1vZJqZm0Aw&_hsmi=2&utm_source=newsletter) under Trump.
Rooftop solar is an effective way for households to reduce their electricity bills. But for a number of reasons, many low-income households [can’t install rooftop solar](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-equity/community-solar-expands-access-to-clean-energy-new-study-shows): They may not own their home, or if they do, the up-front costs might be too high or they could struggle to qualify for a loan. Meanwhile, solar power is a [tough sell for most multifamily housing](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/the-climate-law-is-helping-bring-solar-to-more-apartment-buildings), particularly rental properties where landlords take on the cost of installing panels that primarily benefit tenants, who usually pay the lion’s share of utility bills.
[Community solar projects](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/guides-and-how-tos/what-is-community-solar-and-how-can-you-sign-up) like those developed by Flywheel and others can solve these problems. Low-income households are able to sign up to access energy from these shared installations, letting them tap into the benefits of the clean energy resource.
In places where community solar isn’t available, multifamily properties can still use on-site arrays to reduce their utility bills. Those savings can be used to invest in cost-of-living upgrades, as can lease payments paid to properties that are hosting solar systems.
## **How Trump has scrambled affordable solar economics**
Federal action may not have completely foreclosed affordable solar aspirations — but in many cases, it has narrowed what’s possible.
“This is a drastically different world,” said John Fox, senior director of clean energy at Enterprise Community Partners. His organization runs 
Enterprise has deployed 7.6 MW of solar as well as various projects around battery storage, electric vehicle charging, geothermal heating and cooling systems, and energy-efficiency retrofits.
Enterprise had hoped to deploy 24 megawatts of solar across its properties by 2032. “Now, I think it’s going to be half of that, because that’s what’s cost-effective in this new environment,” Fox said.
And although Flywheel is pushing ahead with its full project pipeline, the financial calculus has gotten tougher due to Trump’s policy changes. The tax-credit phaseout “has a fairly significant impact on the timeframes for projects, and how we manage compliance,” Pitts said.
While the new law doesn’t immediately eliminate [the federal tax credits](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/tax-credit-changes-trump-law) that cover 30% or more of the cost of solar investments, it does [require projects to start construction](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/trump-admin-tightens-vise-on-wind-and-solar-with-new-tax-rules) by July 2026 or to be delivering energy by the end of 2027 to qualify for the incentive. It also forces installers to abide by [complex and still-vague anti-China rules](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/china-foreign-entity-rules-trump) starting next year.
These policy headwinds are raising costs and cutting into the utility bill savings that developers can pass on to low-income residents, Fox said. Enterprise has historically offered average savings between 20% to 50%, and while Fox says the nonprofit can maintain that 20% level for systems that still qualify for tax credits, the “steep discounts of 50%” are not tenable in the current policy environment.
Flywheel earns a fairly good return on its investments, if not as lucrative as those possible from higher-end real estate projects, Pitts said. The company evenly splits its revenues with host properties for some of its projects, and accepts 30% of the revenues for its Solar for All projects — a skinnier cut that still pays out well, given the program’s generous long-term payments for the solar power generated, she said.
Losing federal tax credits will make solar projects more expensive, which will require lenders to adjust their expectations, but Pitts said she thinks their more community-focused financing partners, like the DC Green Bank and local nonprofit 
“With that category of financier, there’s a focus on community investment,” she said.
## **Keeping the affordable solar work going**
A large part of why Flywheel can press on with its plans is its partnership with the local government.
Much of its work has been backed by payments from D.C.’s 6.2 megawatts of solar across 88 sites in D.C. and Maryland.
Finding lenders for these relatively novel solar projects was tough at first, said Miller. The company has primarily worked with CDFIs, which focus on underserved communities.
It also found a crucial partner in the DC Green Bank — one of a [growing number of “green banks”](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/climatetech-finance/epas-new-20b-green-bank-will-benefit-disadvantaged-communities-most) that make clean energy, efficiency, and environmental remediation loans in communities that have been shunned by mainstream lenders. Flywheel’s Fairfax Village project received one of the DC Green Bank has also 
The results speak for themselves. Flywheel’s D.C.-backed projects at properties like the 15.4 million in no-cost electricity to low-income residents of Washington, D.C., Pitts said.
They’ve also provided $4.25 million in lease payments to the properties involved, which have used the money for tasks including replenishing reserve funds and paying for roof repairs. 
Flywheel is helping property owners put some of those proceeds toward energy-efficiency upgrades, Pitts said, which would slash utility bills even further.
At the Perrington Condominiums property in D.C., for example, Flywheel combined solar photovoltaic panels that meet about half the building’s annual electricity needs with rooftop solar thermal systems to offset about 40% of the property’s use of fossil gas to heat water. The property plans to invest the money it’s saving on energy into other capital investments, including efficiency improvements, Pitts said.
Enterprise is encouraging its buildings to do something similar. The nonprofit is working on long-term solar power purchase agreements to hedge against [rising utility rates](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-markets/pjm-rising-costs-interconnection-reform) in the region. “We’re not going to be passing on fluctuations in the market,” Fox said.
Any savings Enterprise can achieve through solar PPAs can be put toward energy-efficiency investments. “We have to run tight buildings. We don’t have a lot of profits to dole out,” Fox said. “Our residents pay 30% max of their living wage on rent plus utilities.”
Plowing energy savings back into properties is key to increasing the financial attractiveness of low-income solar projects to conventional lenders, said Sadie McKeown, president of Community Preservation Corp., a CDFI specializing in affordable multifamily financing. CPC has 230,000 housing units in 24 states, with a focus on New York.
“We know when you make buildings better, their operating economics improve, and you can do more financing because you improve cash flow,” she said. Energy efficiency has been part of CPC’s approach for decades, she said. ”It keeps rents down. It provides much better air quality and health outcomes. It creates resilience against storms. And yes, it addresses getting carbon out of the atmosphere.”
CPC is hoping to use its share of a $7 billion award from the still-frozen federal green bank program to spur more lenders and investors to “crowd in” to building-sustainability projects like these, McKeown said. “When the money comes back, we are ready,” she said.
Driving down the cost of borrowing to pay for these kinds of sustainability investments is a critical step in reducing the need for incentives or subsidies to make them pencil out financially, she said.
“Niche lenders like green banks and CDFIs are really important actors in the front end of this transition,” she said. “Mainstream private capital doesn’t want to change until they see results.”","Solar, Climate justice, Energy equity, Policy regulation",affordable-housing-developers-trump-funding-pullback.md,articles_solar

The U.S. is still on track to build a record amount of new solar capacity this year, even as the Trump administration works to obstruct renewables.
As it stands, the power industry is building more solar than any other type of power plant, which has been the case for several years running. Roughly 12 gigawatts of new solar capacity joined the grid in the first half of the year, and 21 gigawatts more are slated for completion by the end of the year, according to a 
In recent years, solar has dominated new power plant construction, along with batteries and wind. (EIA)
Solar thus will contribute more than half of the expected 64 gigawatts of new power capacity additions this year. Adding in battery storage and wind installations, clean energy is on track to deliver [93% of new power-plant capacity this year](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-solar-batteries-to-lead-us-power-plant-construction-in-2025), the EIA predicted in February. Moreover, 2025 could set the U.S. record for new power-plant construction, beating the 58 gigawatts added in 2002 at the height of a natural-gas plant boom.
Those facts reflect a set of hopeful trends: The U.S. is building power plants at a record pace; nearly all of those new plants will not emit carbon emissions; and, since renewables and batteries cost far less to operate than fossil fuel plants, they exert downward pressure on electricity costs. These are all good things to see at a time when demand for new power production is soaring — thanks to electrification, industrial growth, and an AI computing bubble — and consumers are grappling with [steadily rising electricity rates](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/electricity-prices-rising-trump-impact).
Of course, these trends could prove short-lived, because the Trump administration is actively working to obstruct the buildout of clean and cheap energy.
This summer’s signature Republican domestic policy law [targeted wind and solar](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/tax-credit-changes-trump-law) with early termination of their tax credits, effectively raising the cost to deploy these types of power plants. The executive branch has sought to halt or inhibit [offshore wind](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-interior-revokes-leasing-areas) and [renewable development on public lands](https://www.canarymedia.com/newsletters/trump-looks-to-slow-clean-energy-development-on-federal-lands). Simultaneously, the Trump administration is giving an artificial boost to fossil-fuel plants. The Department of Energy is invoking emergency powers to [block the planned shutdown](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/trump-extend-campbell-michigan-coal-plant) of the J.H. Cambpell coal-fired plant in Michigan, [forcing customers to pay millions of dollars extra](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/forcing-dirty-power-plants-to-stay-open-would-cost-americans-billions) to preserve an outdated, uneconomical facility. Analysts fear the DOE could repeat this tactic with other uneconomic fossil-burning plants that are scheduled to retire.
Any clean power plants coming online this year were planned, permitted, and undergoing construction before Trump’s policy shifts took effect (though his officials have found ways to [interrupt construction that was fully permitted](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/equinor-empire-trump-timeline), like the Empire Wind project off the coast of New York). In that sense, this year’s buildout offers the last snapshot of what it looks like when the electricity industry serves market demand with modern technologies absent active resistance from the U.S. government.
It’s still possible that momentum will carry the solar industry to another record year in 2026. Developers effectively need to [start construction by the first half of 2026](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-manufacturing/solar-factories-outlook-trump-megabill) to claim the full tax credit, and the administration recently [tightened the longstanding tax rules](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/trump-admin-tightens-vise-on-wind-and-solar-with-new-tax-rules) on what counts as “starting,” further upping the pressure to get going.

The National Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO), a group representing the state agencies responsible for managing a large chunk of Solar for All funding, also widely circulated an email warning that the EPA could be on the brink of ending the program.
“We do not have any additional details or validation of the news that has been reported,” NASEO President David Terry wrote in the email, which was shared with Canary Media. “Yet, the information received yesterday comes from a credible source.” (NASEO did not immediately respond to requests for comment.)
Cutting Solar for All funding would be a mistake, said Michelle Moore, CEO of Washington, D.C.–based nonprofit Groundswell. Over the next five years, the program promises to deliver more than $350 million in annual electric bill savings to more than 900,000 low-income and disadvantaged households — desperately needed relief in a time of high and rising utility costs.
And the more than 4 gigawatts of solar power the program aims to bring online, much of it backed up by batteries, could help utilities across the country meet growing demand at a time when the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have undermined the policies supporting clean energy growth.
Groundswell is using its $156 million Solar for All grant to launch the 100 megawatts of distributed solar and battery projects.
Those projects could cut electricity bills in half and improve local resilience for more than 17,000 households. That’s a vital source of new grid capacity for a region facing unprecedented growth in demand for electricity, Moore said.
“This country is short on power right now. We need every electron we can get,” she said. Terminating Solar for All at this stage would equate to “this administration raising electricity bills for more than 1 million families. Now is not the time.”
## **How the Trump administration has undercut Solar for All**
Solar for All, an initiative of the Inflation Reduction Act’s [$27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/climatetech-finance/epas-new-20b-green-bank-will-benefit-disadvantaged-communities-most) (GGRF), had its funding frozen in January as part of a [broader attack on Biden-era climate and environmental](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/trumps-climate-spending-freeze-is-already-causing-serious-economic-harm) programs.
In the face of court orders declaring these freezes unlawful, in February the EPA
But because of the way that reimbursement is structured under the program, the coalition and other Solar for All awardees need the EPA to continue to make funds available to cover ongoing expenses. “It’s not like there’s $156 million in our bank account,” she said.
Other EPA-administered programs haven’t fared so well. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin is still [blocking $20 billion in funding for the broader GGRF program](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/trump-admin-says-its-terminated-20b-green-bank-in-latest-escalation) and is EPA is also 
Solar for All has been something of a bright spot amid these roadblocks, Brown said. In recent months, grantees like Georgia Bright have begun rolling out their first rounds of funds. In May, Vermont’s Department of Public Service 1 million to help a sober living facility in Reno install rooftop solar.
“It seems like this program has bipartisan support — CEO of the Nevada Clean Energy Fund. “If an affordable housing owner needs to pay more for their utility bills, it means they are paying less on supportive services for their tenants.”
The EPA’s initial funding freeze was concerning, said Chris Walker, head of national policy and programs for Grid Alternatives, the country’s largest free solar installation nonprofit and prime contractor for “we were confident we were on a solid legal footing to continue the work, and continued staffing and contracting processes, with a bit of nervousness about what might be coming,” he said.
Now, as Grid Alternatives prepares to launch its first Solar for All projects, he said, “We’re in capacity-building mode and compliance mode.”
Rumors that the EPA plans to terminate Solar for All have been swirling for months, said Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environmental justice at Lawyers for Good Government, a nonprofit coalition of attorneys, law students, and activists that’s 
“There are many, many Solar for All grantees doing everything in their power to move things forward,” she said. “But EPA is not making it easy.”
Cutting off Solar for All grants would almost certainly draw a legal challenge, given that the funds were awarded by the EPA last year under contracts that cannot be terminated without cause.
“If leaders in the Trump administration move forward with this unlawful attempt to strip critical funding from communities across the United States, we will see them in court,” Kym Meyer, litigation director for the Southern Environmental Law Center, told Canary Media. “We have already seen the immense good this program has done on the ground, and we won’t let it be snatched away to score political points.”
Complicating matters, Blanchard said, is the [megalaw passed by Republicans in Congress last month](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/senates-big-beautiful-bill-would-be-a-disaster-for-clean-energy), which officially repealed statutory authority for the GGRF and rescinded unspent funds from the program. The law, however, 
An EPA spokesperson declined to say if the agency intends to terminate Solar for All grants, but told Canary Media in a Tuesday email that “with the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, EPA is working to ensure Congressional intent is fully implemented in accordance with the law.”
Blanchard said that language in the megalaw clearly indicates that the intent of lawmakers was to retain obligated spending from the GGRF. “If EPA does this unilaterally, it will be pulling a complete bait and switch on the American people, increasing utility bills, and flouting congressional intent,” she said.
## **Building the energy the grid needs — and fast**
Terminating Solar for All funds wouldn’t just harm the communities burdened by high and rising electricity prices, said Sachu Constantine, executive director of nonprofit advocacy group Vote Solar. It would also hurt utilities struggling to meet rising electricity demand.
A “targets frontline underinvested communities, which means it’s targeting weak spots on the grid,” Constantine said. “It’s infrastructure in the right places for the right people.”
And solar and batteries are the right technology to solve the problem, he contended. Solar panels and lithium-ion batteries are not only the cheapest and fastest-to-deploy sources of new grid supply; they’re also capable of lowering peak electricity demands that drive the lion’s share of utility costs, by [serving as virtual power plants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/rooftop-solar-industry-trump-budget-law).
“When we don’t have to deploy the most expensive peaker [power plants], when we can better utilize the distribution lines, we’re saving the cost for everyone,” he said. “We’re taking the entire system and making it run better.”
That’s a role Georgia Bright wants to play with its community-benefits solar program, Brown said. Last month, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a long-term resource plan from Georgia Power, the state’s biggest utility, which has been criticized by environmental and consumer advocates for extending the life of aging coal-fired power plants and [opening the door to building up to 8.5 gigawatts](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/georgia-power-plan-gas-expansion) of new fossil gas–fired turbines.
But the plan also includes a pledge from Georgia Power to develop a pilot program that will seek up to 50 megawatts of solar and battery capacity from customers. Georgia Bright worked to get that program included in the utility’s plan, Brown said — and it plans to use its community-benefits solar program to help churches, nonprofits, businesses, and multifamily housing properties install the solar and batteries to participate in it. “I think we’ll hit the 50 megawatts pretty quickly — and the commission is open to raise that limit,” she said. “They recognize if you need to serve all this new load, you can’t wait on natural gas plants that have a five-year backlog to get a turbine.”
Groundswell’s Southeast Rural Power Program offers similar fast-start options for utilities struggling to meet growing demand for power, Moore said. “It’s a straightforward way to work across the Southeast in very diverse states with very diverse needs.”
SECO Energy, a rural electric cooperative in Florida, is one of the potential partners for Groundswell’s new program. About 80,000 of SECO’s roughly 250,000 customers are low and moderate income, and “Solar for All checks a lot of the boxes for us to serve that segment of the population,” SECO CEO Curtis Wynn said.
“We’re in a high-growth area, and during the last two or three days, the heat index was over 100 degrees — it puts a strain on our system,” he said. “If there’s a way we can use grant dollars to buy down the cost of generation today that’s going to remain stable in the next 20 years in a rising-cost environment, that’s a huge advantage.”","Solar, Clean energy, Policy regulation",trump-looks-to-kill-solar-for-all-just-as-it-starts-to-deliver.md,articles_solar

Solar generated more power than it ever has before on Texas’ grid earlier this month.
That’s impressive, but even more so when you consider that it was the 17th record the power source set in the state this year, according to a 
The record setting started bright and early on Jan. 24, when solar generated 22.1 gigawatts of power. That figure has since steadily risen, and on Sept. 9, solar produced a huge 29.9 GW. Also that day, solar provided more than 40% of the state’s power from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., per data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the state’s grid operator.
That early September day capped a groundbreaking summer for solar in Texas. From June 1 through Aug. 31, solar met 15.2% of all demand in the ERCOT system. Coal provided for 12.5% of demand during that time.
And solar wasn’t the only top performer this year. Battery storage has already set four discharge records in Texas this month, often charging up on solar power that floods the grid in the mornings and putting it back into the system when the sun sets, per the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.
Texas’ extreme summer temperatures have frequently driven ERCOT to ask people to conserve power, warning that increased air-conditioning use could overwhelm the grid’s energy supplies. But this year, ERCOT didn’t ask customers to conserve power at all, and 
This all reveals solar’s growing ability to replace fossil fuels and meet power demand in Texas, especially when the clean energy source is paired with batteries. And it couldn’t be more necessary: The U.S. Energy Information Administration anticipates 23% from 2024 to 2026.
Meanwhile, natural gas is failing to meet the moment. Texas developers have proposed 7.2 billion loan program to incentivize gas plant construction, but more than two years after that fund was launched, [just two facilities](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/texas-gas-plant-loans-projects-approved) have been approved for only $321 million in loans. Developers pulled another seven projects from consideration, citing

https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/vermont-new-hampshire-plug-in-balcony-legislation,Plug-in solar bills are in the works in New Hampshire and Vermont,23 September 2025,Sarah Shemkus,"DIY “balcony” solar kits, which can save residents money and give them more independence, are piquing interest from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. 
Plug-in solar systems may provide a fraction of the energy generated by conventional rooftop arrays, but they also cost a lot less and are easier to install. (Bright Saver)
Small solar-panel kits that can be assembled as easily as an Ikea bookcase and plugged into a regular residential outlet could be coming soon to New Hampshire and Vermont. Lawmakers and advocates in both states are preparing legislation that would make these plug-in solar systems accessible to residents who don’t have the space, money, or inclination to install a larger, conventional rooftop array.
“It’s really about energy affordability,” said Kevin Chou, cofounder of “It’s about access for people who wanted solar but haven’t been able to get it.”
These systems — also called “portable” or “balcony” solar — generally come in kits that even a novice can put together at home. They plug into a standard outlet, sending the power they generate into a home’s wires, rather than drawing electricity out.
Unlike rooftop arrays, plug-in systems don’t generate enough power to meet all, or even most, of a household’s needs, but they offset enough consumption to pay for themselves within four or five years, even without incentives like tax credits or [net metering](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/guides-and-how-tos/what-is-net-metering-and-other-solar-terms-explained), Chou said. Models now on the market start at about $2,000. If the equipment becomes more popular and prices come down, the payback period could get even shorter.
“You don’t need any subsidies to make this work,” Chou said. “The pure economics are so attractive, it’s one of the best investments you can make.”
These systems have [taken off in Germany](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/balcony-panels-germany-utah), where 
Recently, though, the idea has gained traction in the U.S. In March, Utah lawmakers, working with Bright Saver, unanimously 
All of the legislative proposals follow the same principles as Utah’s law: They would define a new class of small, portable solar systems, and establish the right of households to use the systems without submitting applications or paying fees to the state or utilities. They also define safety standards for the systems, including that they be certified by Underwriters Laboratories, or UL, a company that sets standards and provides safety certifications for a wide range of products.
At the moment, two manufacturers make plug-in solar systems with inverters that have been certified as complying with safety requirements, Chou said. Because the market for portable solar is so new, however, UL has not developed standards for entire systems. Bright Saver and other plug-in solar supporters have been working with the company on this issue and expect a standard to be released in the next month or two, Chou said.
Other startups are waiting in the wings, hoping to launch their own products next year, once the questions about UL standards are resolved, he added.
“Bottom line: Once Vermont’s legislation passes, there will be existing manufacturers ready to sell into the state immediately, along with new entrants waiting for additional UL clarity, who are also preparing to launch,” Chou said.
Supporters hope the benefits of plug-in solar — lowered electricity costs, freedom to make personal energy choices — will help the idea gain support even in states not known for their embrace of renewable energy, and despite federal efforts to slow or stop renewable energy progress. The early and robust acceptance of the technology in deep-red Utah has bolstered this vision.
“I am optimistic that, as in Utah, it’s going to be seen as a commonsense way to just get out of the way and let people do good things,” said Ben Edgerly Walsh, climate and energy program director at the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, an organization backing Vermont’s expected plug-in solar bill.
In New Hampshire, a swing state known for its “live free or die” libertarian streak, Democratic state Sen. David Watters also thinks this dynamic might work in the technology’s favor, despite the state’s historical lack of support for measures boosting solar use.
“We’re really kind of stuck in a rut with anti-renewable-energy sentiment in the House,” Watters said. “This seemed like something that would fit into the ethos of people being able to make individual choices.”
Watters, a member of the state Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, worked with local advocacy group Clean Energy New Hampshire to author a rough draft of a plug-in solar bill based on Utah’s new law. It will be refined in the coming months and formally introduced in the legislature in January.
Notably, Watters said, his proposal would not stop homeowners associations or landlords from imposing their own rules on members and tenants. 
“Their authority is not taken away,” he said. “For this state, that’s crucial.”
In Vermont, two Democratic state legislators — Sen. Anne Watson, chair of the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy, and Rep. Kathleen James, chair of the counterpart committee in the House — are championing a plug-in solar bill based on model legislation drafted by Bright Saver. Watson is particularly excited for the potential of plug-in solar to reach low-income residents and renters.
“This creates access for folks who might otherwise not have the authority to put something on their roof, or who might need something a little more flexible,” she said.
Vermont, a decidedly left-leaning state, has long welcomed renewables. The state’s governor, Phil Scott, however, is a Republican who has shown reluctance to spend public money on clean energy. Further, the legislature lost its veto-proof Democratic majorities during the last election, so [prospects for forward movement](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/vermonts-clean-energy-transition-faces-unprecedented-political-threat) on energy and climate issues have been dimmed this year.
However, Watson has already heard a lot of positive feedback from her fellow lawmakers, even though the bill won’t be taken up until the legislature reconvenes in January. Indeed, several colleagues came to her with similar proposals before learning she was already working on it. She has also had initial conversations with the Scott administration and found it willing to consider the idea, she said.
“While I can’t say they are necessarily for it, the reception I’ve received so far is that they are open and interested in learning more,” she said. “I am hoping for broad support.”","Solar, Policy regulation, Northeast, New Hampshire, Vermont",vermont-new-hampshire-plug-in-balcony-legislation.md,articles_solar
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/california-utility-clean-energy-microgrids-wildfires,Can utilities replace power lines with solar and batteries in remote areas?,8 September 2025,Jeff St. John,"Expanding the grid to reach far-flung customers can be a costly fire hazard. So utilities like PGE are testing out microgrids using solar, batteries, and generators. 
A solar array built by BoxPower is charging batteries and keeping five PG&E customers supplied with electricity at a remote grid project in Briceburg, California. (
Michael Gillogly, manager of the Pepperwood Preserve, understands the wildfire risk that power lines pose firsthand. The 3,200-acre nature reserve in Sonoma County, California, burned in 2017 when a privately owned electrical system 2019 during a conflagration Electric.
So when PGE approached Gillogly about installing a “We do a lot of wildfire research here,” he noted. Getting rid of “the line up to the Bechtel House is part of PGE’s work on eliminating the risk of fire.”
PGE covered the costs of building the microgrid, and so far, the solar and batteries have kept the light and heat on at the guest house, even when a dozen or so researchers spent several cloudy days there, Gillogly said.
Over the past few years, PGE has increasingly opted for these “2027.
Until recently, utilities have rarely promoted solar-and-battery alternatives to power lines, particularly if they don’t own the solar and batteries in question. After all, utilities earn guaranteed profits on the money they spend on their grids.
But PGE’s remote-grid initiative, launched with 
“It all depends on what the alternative is,” said Abigail Tinker, senior manager of grid innovation delivery at PGE. For the communities the utility has targeted, power lines can be quite expensive, largely due to the cost of ensuring that they won’t cause wildfires.
PGE was 2019 after its power lines sparked PGE and California’s other major utilities are 
But these wildfire-prevention investments are [driving up utility expenditures](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/californias-utility-bill-crisis-is-clear-to-all-the-solution-not-so-much) and customer rates. Solar and batteries are an increasingly cost-effective alternative, Tinker said, with the benefits outweighing the price tag of having to harden as little as a mile of power lines.
PGE saves money either by getting rid of grid connections altogether or by delaying the construction of new lines. Microgrids can also improve reliability for customers when utilities must intentionally de-energize the lines that serve them during windstorms and other times of high wildfire risk — an increasingly common contingency in fire-prone areas.
Angelo Campus, CEO of BoxPower, which built most of PGE’s remote microgrids, sees the strategy penciling out for more and more utilities for these same reasons.
“We’re working with about a dozen utilities across the country on similar but distinct flavors of this,” he said. “Wildfire mitigation is a huge issue across the West,” and 
Utilities are responsible for 2020, and potentially more for another fire in 2022. Hawaiian Electric paid a 2023 Maui fires 
Microgrids can’t replace the majority of a utility’s system, of course. But they are being considered for increasingly large communities, Campus said.
Nevada utility NV Energy has proposed “ruggedized” overhead lines should save about $21 million compared to burying power lines underground, while limiting impacts of wildfire-prevention power outages, according to the utility.
Some larger projects have already been built. San Diego Gas Electric has been 2013, offering about 3,000 residents backup solar, battery, and generator power to bolster the single line that connects them to the larger grid, which is susceptible to being shut off due to wildfire risk. [Duke Energy built a microgrid](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/distributed-energy-resources/hurricane-helene-underscores-need-for-more-solar-battery-microgrids) in Hot Springs, North Carolina, a town of about 535 residents served by a single 10-mile power line prone to outages, on the grounds that it was cheaper than building a second line to improve reliability.
In each of these cases, utilities must weigh the costs of the alternatives, Tinker said. “It’s complicated and nuanced in terms of dollars per mile, because you have to be able to do the evaluation of individual circuits, and what can be done to mitigate the risk for each circuit,” she said.
Whether microgrids are connected to the larger grid or not, utilities need to maintain communications links with them to ensure the systems are operating reliably and safely. PGE is

Utilities have been far less friendly to customer-owned microgrids in general, however, seeing them as a threat to their core business model. Since 2018, California law has required the state Public Utilities Commission to develop rules to

“It is a very difficult balance that PGE is constantly trying to strike, with the oversight of [utility regulators] and other stakeholders, between safety and reliability and affordability,” Tinker said. “That’s something we’re trying to thread the needle on.”
But as the costs of expanding and maintaining utility grids continue to climb, and solar and batteries become more affordable, utilities and their customers are likely to see more opportunities to make microgrids work, Campus said.
“The cost of building poles and wires and maintaining distribution infrastructure has grown substantially over the past 20 years,” he said. “Look at the cost of distributed generation and battery — it’s an inverse cost curve.” 
_A correction was made on Sept. 11, 2025: This story originally misstated PGE’s timeline for installing more than 30 remote grids.

The GOP’s tax credit cuts could make a bad situation worse. 
U.S. companies that install and finance residential solar have been struggling for years with [unfavorable policy shifts in California](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/californias-rooftop-solar-debate-is-raging-again), the country’s biggest rooftop solar market. Now, they face an even more serious threat — Republicans in Congress, who have proposed to [take away the tax credits](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/house-republicans-nuke-incentives-for-clean-energy-except-nuclear) that undergird the industry.
These mounting pressures have driven two of the most prominent firms in the U.S. residential solar sector into bankruptcy in recent days.
Residential solar provider [warned investors](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/sunnova-warns-of-dwindling-cash-amid-rooftop-solar-woes) that it could run out of cash due to falling sales, rising operational costs, and a growing debt burden. The Houston-based company, which reported 2024, stated “intends to continue operating its business in the ordinary course throughout the sale process.”
Privately held solar lender “reorganize the business to meet its current liquidity needs.” The Oakland, California-based company, which claims it has funded $15 billion in loans to more than 500,000 households, cited “[m]acroeconomic challenges facing the entire residential solar industry, including high interest rates and legislation that threatens to eliminate tax credits for residential solar.”
Those two companies have unique problems that have contributed to their financial collapse, said Joe Osha, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities. “The causes of the difficulties that Mosaic and Sunnova face predate Trump,” he said.
But they also suffered from a market environment that is increasingly difficult and uncertain for every firm in the sector, he said.
The reconciliation bill passed by the House of Representatives last month and now being considered in the Senate would abruptly end a tax-credit regime that’s supported households and solar installers for the past 20 years.
The bill would 2025, essentially making those installations about one-third more expensive than they are today.

## **Singling out Sunnova and Mosaic’s challenges**
That bill hasn’t been passed yet, however. Osha warned that it’s too early to extrapolate broader implications for the industry at large from these latest bankruptcies.
That’s because both Mosaic and Sunnova have fallen prey not only to challenging business conditions, but to mistakes in how they’ve reacted to the sector’s ongoing woes, he said.
“The way this business works, at the most basic level, is that you spend money now to create a long stream of contracted cash flows in the future,” Osha said. In the case of solar companies like Sunnova and Mosaic, those cash flows come from households making payments on the loans, leases, or power purchase agreements they’ve signed. The companies bundle those into asset-backed securities for sale to investment banks and other financial firms.
But those securities become far less attractive to buyers when the market for residential solar sours — and in the past year it has soured dramatically. Wood Mackenzie reported a 2024 from the prior year.
The Solar Energy Industries Association reported in March that 2021. The trade group’s “we have now had six consecutive quarters of year-over-year decline in residential solar installations,” Pavel Molchanov, investment strategy analyst at financial services firm Raymond James, pointed out. That includes a 13% year-over-year decline in the first quarter of 2025.
“In any industry, six consecutive down quarters is going to lead to pressure on companies across the board,” he said. “There’s just no escaping that.”
This downturn left Sunnova and Mosaic exposed to a cash crunch, Osha said.
Over the past 18 months or so, Sunnova had chosen to take on 10 billion to $50 billion and debt of $10.67 billion as of Dec. 31.
Mosaic most likely experienced a similar liquidity crunch as it was “failed to make the transition from solar loans to third-party ownership” as interest rates climbed, making loans more expensive options compared to leases or power purchase agreements.
Molchanov emphasized that “financing is at the center of how this industry has historically functioned.” The companies in question built their businesses during the 2010s, when the country had historically low interest rates. But those interest rates have spiked in the past three years in response to the Covid pandemic’s economic disruptions and resulting inflation, driving up the cost of capital for all businesses — including companies borrowing money to install rooftop solar systems.
“There’s a very narrow pathway to navigate when the broader interest rate environment is so difficult,” Molchanov said. “Whatever strategic or tactical mistakes companies made, if we had this conversation five years ago, when interest rates were close to zero, those mistakes would not have been lethal. But now they can be lethal.”
## **The bigger picture**
Sunnova is the latest in a string of [SunPower, which collapsed in August 2024](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/sunpower-a-solar-icon-once-valued-in-the-billions-files-for-bankruptcy). Solar lender Sunlight Financial, which offered lending options similar to those from Mosaic, declared bankruptcy in 2023 and 
Filing for bankruptcy protection doesn’t necessarily mean that the companies will cease to exist. Some of SunPower’s business was 
Nor does bankruptcy mean that customers will be 
It’s also important to distinguish these newly bankrupt companies from others in the space, Osha said. For example, Sunrun, the biggest U.S. residential solar installer with 18 months or so, he said.
“What Sunrun has done in contrast to Sunnova is say, ‘We’re going to sell off those future cash flows to the greatest extent possible, so that we have money today,’” he said.
The House bill’s provision that would cut off tax credits for solar leasing does, however, pose a significant threat to Sunrun’s predominant business model of offering leases and power purchase agreements to residences, Osha said.
The House bill would not cancel tax credits for power purchase agreements, the other primary mechanism for companies that offer third-party-owned solar, Osha said. But in his Monday research note, he opined that this exclusion was “a loophole, not a deliberate plan on the part of legislators,” and that incentives for power purchase agreements would likely suffer the same fate as those for leases and homeowners in a final bill to emerge from Congress.
Whether tax credits expire abruptly at the end of 2025 or there’s an extension beyond that will have a significant impact on the financial viability of large-scale residential solar companies like Sunrun.
“Today, Sunrun’s business model is entirely centered on third-party ownership and tax credits,” he said. “But you can also say that they are a very well-run company that has surely thought about this, and [it] is likely, if the hammer does come down, they have a plan.”
At the same time, thousands of smaller companies that make up the majority of residential solar installations would almost certainly suffer from the tax-credit changes, even if their challenges go less noticed than those of industry stalwarts, said Kristina Costa, former clean energy adviser for the Biden administration.
That would have negative consequences for those working in the industry. Residential solar installation accounted for 2023, according to the most recent survey from the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. The current market downturn has already had a negative impact. The California Solar and Storage Association estimated that roughly 17,000 people, or 22% of the state’s distributed solar and storage workforce, [lost their jobs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/californias-rooftop-solar-policies-threaten-progress-on-climate) between April 2023, when the state reduced incentives for rooftop solar owners, and the end of that year. 
“You have a lot of mom-and-pop small business outfits in the solar residential space that are going to be profoundly affected by this bill that’s being debated in Congress right now,” Costa said. “It will be harder and more expensive to install solar and storage in homes — and it may or may not still make sense for somebody to do so, depending on what their state’s energy prices are looking like.”
Given that the House bill is expected to drive up [electricity prices already being pushed higher](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/rising-gas-electric-bills-survey) by President Donald Trump’s tariff and energy policies, undermining the economics of rooftop solar “is a pretty direct attack by the House on energy prices in the wrong direction,” Costa said.","Solar, Climatetech finance, Policy regulation",sunnova-mosaic-bankruptcies-industry-challenges.md,articles_solar
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/farmers-agrivoltaics-california-research,Farmers are making bank harvesting a new crop: Solar energy,5 May 2025,Matt Simon,"In California’s water-stressed Central Valley, farmers are fallowing land and installing solar, providing financial stability and saving water. 
_This_ _was originally published by_ _. Sign up for Grist’s_ _._
Around the world, farmers are retooling their land to harvest the hottest new commodity: sunlight. As the price of renewable energy technology has plummeted and water has gotten more scarce, growers are fallowing acreage and installing solar panels. Some are even growing crops beneath them, which is great for plants stressed by too many rays. Still others are letting that shaded land go wild, providing habitat for pollinators and fodder for grazing livestock.
According to a 25 years — and for the environment. Researchers looked at producers who had idled land and installed solar, using the electricity to run equipment like water pumps and selling the excess power to utilities.
On average, that energy savings and revenue added up to $124,000 per hectare (about 2.5 acres) each year, 25 times the value of using the land to grow crops. Collectively, the juice generated in the Central Valley could power around 500,000 households while saving enough water to hydrate 27 million people annually. “If a farmer owns 10 acres of land, and they choose to convert 1 or 2 acres to a solar array, that could produce enough income for them to feel security for their whole operation,” said Jake Stid, a renewable energy landscape scientist at Michigan State University and lead author of the paper, published in the journal Nature Sustainability.
The Central Valley is among the most productive agricultural regions in the world: It makes up just 1% of all farmland acreage in the United States 
Farmers can’t make their crops less thirsty, so many have been converting some of their acreage to solar. The Central Valley is ideal for this, being mostly flat and very sunny, hence the agricultural productivity. At the same time, farmers have been getting good rates for the electricity that they offset and that they send back to the grid.
Now, though, California has adopted standards that reduce those rates by “The algebra or calculus — or whatever math discipline you want to reference — it just doesn’t work out the same way,” said Karen Norene Mills, vice president of legal advocacy at the California Farm Bureau, which promotes the state’s agricultural community.
Also, the study found that by fallowing land for solar panels, food production in the Central Valley dropped by enough calories to feed 86,000 people a year. But, Stid said, markets can adjust, as crops are grown elsewhere to make up the deficit. By tapping the sun instead, Stid added, growers can simultaneously help California reach its goals of deploying renewable and reducing groundwater usage.
The tension, though, is meeting those objectives while still producing incredible quantities of food. “That is always our concern about some of these pressures,” Mills said.
But this isn’t an either-or proposition: Many farmers are finding ways to grow some crops, like leafy greens and berries, under the panels. The shade reduces evaporation from the soil, allowing growers to water less often. In turn, a wetted landscape cools the panels, which improves their efficiency. “This is the compromise that’s going to allow for both energy independence and food security,” said horticulturalist Jennifer Bousselot, who studies agrisolar at Colorado State University but wasn’t involved in the new study.
Farmers are also turning livestock loose to graze under their panels. Their droppings fertilize the soil, leading to more plant growth and more flowers that support native pollinators. “The grass, it’s so much more lush under the panels, it’s amazing,” said Ryan Romack, founder of Virginia-based AgriSolar Ranch, which provides grazing services. “Especially when the sheep have been on site long-term, you can really see the added benefits of the manure load.”
Then, if a farmer decides not to replace the solar panels at the end of their lifespan — usually around 25 or 30 years — the soil will be refreshed with nutrients and ready to grow more crops. Even if a grower simply lets them sit for decades without any management, the fallowing can restore the soil’s health. “We really see solar as a collective landscape,” Stid said, “that can be sited, managed, and designed in a way to benefit both people and the planet and ecosystems as well.”","Solar, Clean energy, Food and farms, West, California",farmers-agrivoltaics-california-research.md,articles_solar
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/re-2025-conference-clean-energy-industry-outlook,"The solar industry threw a party in Vegas, and it actually wasn’t sad",16 September 2025,Julian Spector,"After relentless setbacks from the Trump administration, solar and storage pros are finding solace in booming demand for electricity.

LAS VEGAS — There were plenty of reasons to think that this year’s RE+, the U.S. solar industry’s biggest annual gathering, would be a gloomy and downtrodden affair.
The Trump administration had declared an energy emergency, then set about reducing energy supply by going after renewables projects. The massive spending law [yanked nearly seven years of tax credits](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/wind-solar-construction-trump-tax-credits) for wind and solar. The White House arbitrarily [halted](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/equinor-empire-trump-timeline) [construction](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-admin-halts-construction-of-nearly-finished-offshore-wind-farm) on two major offshore wind farms that had all their permits in order, raising the fear that it might block other fully approved projects. Tariffs have changed the price of parts that go into clean energy equipment on a sometimes weekly basis. The cleantech bankruptcies have been relentless: [Powin](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/powin-bankrupt-grid-batteries), [Sunnova, Mosaic](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/sunnova-mosaic-bankruptcies-industry-challenges), [Li-Cycle](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/recycling-renewables/li-cycles-quest-to-recycle-lithium-ion-batteries-ends-in-bankruptcy), 
“I can’t think of a time when we have been subject to quite as much of a brutal swing as we’ve been in now,” said Abby Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, which puts on the conference.
But when I got to the exhibit hall at the Venetian Expo, it stretched farther than I’d ever seen at a clean energy show, and I heard rumors of additional halls above and below. The exhibitors even sprawled across a sunwashed bridge to Caesar’s Forum, where vendors of flow batteries and other alternative technologies hawked their wares, quite fittingly, from the periphery of the event.
Final attendance for the show hit 37,000, just shy of the record 40,000 from the previous two years, and other metrics broke records. The mood on the floor, in the halls, and at the myriad Vegas afterparties reflected an industry that had taken some punches, had lost some nice things, but was nonetheless charging forward, resolute and battle-tested.
“If you’d asked me in May how I was feeling about RE+, I would have a very different answer,” Hopper noted at a roundtable with journalists a few days into the show. “But we have more exhibitors than we’ve ever had in our history, and we have more registration revenue than we’ve ever had in our history. … [People] are really, really hungry for information and for a vision for what’s coming next.”
Judging by this year’s dire headlines, the show’s ebullient atmosphere does not seem entirely rational. Of course, even teetering startups try to project confidence among peers, customers, and especially journalists. And the overstimulated Vegas backdrop inspires a particular strain of optimism, the kind that encourages you to light cash on fire and feel lucky for the opportunity.
But after three days of roaming the frenetic halls, I came to see this year’s positive outlook as warranted. The general consensus among conference goers seemed to be that though political headwinds are blowing hard, economic tailwinds are blowing harder. Here are three reasons why I think they are right.
## **Forget policy, look at the markets**
With the federal tax credits cut short, fewer solar projects will get built, and costs will rise for the ones that still go forward, passing on higher energy bills to American consumers.
But, with a little distance from the sting of this summer’s legislative setbacks, many solar and energy storage professionals believe losses in the policy arena are counterbalanced by increasingly rosy outlooks in the marketplace.
“I think people tend to over-orient on the policy story, and under-orient on the economic and financial story,” said Alfred Johnson, CEO of the [clean energy financing platform Crux](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/the-tax-code-change-unleashing-25b-in-clean-energy-investment), as we sipped espressos outside the hubbub of the cavernous expo halls.
Johnson’s company launched as a marketplace for tax credit transferability, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act, but has expanded into other forms of financing, like debt and tax equity. That perch gives him visibility into clean energy project economics and the flows of capital into the sector. He ticked off a series of key factors defining the current energy market: [Electricity prices are way up](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/electricity-prices-rising-trump-impact); solar and battery keeps getting cheaper while improving performance; gas prices are rising as the Trump administration promotes exports; gas turbine prices are rising due to intense competition from buyers.
In short, it’s a bad time to be someone who uses electricity in America, despite President Donald Trump’s campaign promise to cut energy prices. That means, though, that it’s a great time to be someone who sells power.
Even better for power producers, the biggest new customers — [data centers](https://www.canarymedia.com/boon-or-bane-what-will-data-centers-do-to-the-grid) — have the price sensitivity of a ravenous grizzly bear. They’re trying, with the enthusiastic support of the White House, to win a global arms race to unlock artificial superintelligence, whatever that means. Facing such civilizational stakes, the hyperscalers aren’t going to quibble over nickels and dimes.
Even with elevated electricity prices, hyperscalers still have to pay a lot more for the “AI models, Johnson noted. And once they’ve paid for those GPUs, they want to use them as much as possible, which means gobbling up as much electricity as they can get.
“The value of being faster on delivering the model … is worth so much more … than the additional cost of energy, which means that the marginal demand in a lot of these markets is the data centers, who are not price sensitive,” Johnson said.
Solar is clearly the cheapest source of new electricity production. But what matters most now is speed to market, and here solar and batteries easily trounce all other commercially viable sources of power. Taking mass-produced panels and parts and assembling them in a field is fundamentally easier than constructing a traditional large power plant. And it’s a hell of a lot easier than some of the hyperscalers’ other ideas, like building nonexistent nuclear fusion plants, or nonexistent small modular reactors, or [restarting a long-shuttered nuclear reactor](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear/palisades-three-mile-island-nuclear-restart) at the notorious Three Mile Island plant.
These dynamics led some of my fellow conference goers to muse about a counterfactual choice: Would you rather have strong federal policy tailwinds and an unfavorable market, or booming market fundamentals but unfavorable policy? Nine months ago, the industry enjoyed both. Trump ended those good times, but the robust market serves to mollify the pain of his policy attacks.
## **Solar got whacked, but storage is booming**
SEIA has strived to welcome energy storage into the fold, and diversification from solar alone looks especially prescient these days. Rooftop solar is struggling in a big way, with the federal onslaught and [friendly fire](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/californias-rooftop-solar-policies-threaten-progress-on-climate) from states like California, and large-scale developers are racing to cram in a bumper crop of projects before tax credits disappear next July. (Projects that start construction after that must be operating by the end of 2027 to qualify for the federal incentives.) But storage companies evaded the policy setbacks of their solar-powered brethren, and are building toward yet another record year of construction.
“Right now, we are seeing all of the factors are very supportive to storage,” said Johnson. “Demand is going up, there’s more of a focus on having dispatchable power. It got tax credits for the first time in the IRA … and then it retained the tax credits in [the One Big Beautiful Bill Act].”
The budget law preserves the battery-installation tax credits through 2033, with the stipulation that projects prove they don’t excessively rely on parts or corporate support from China. That [sparked initial concerns](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/china-foreign-entity-rules-trump) from some analysts that these Foreign Entity of Concern rules (FEOC) could be enforced in a way that strangles development arbitrarily.
A few months later, many storage developers are encouraged by how clearly the text of the law lays out the boxes to check. Even so, compliance creates extra work for the American companies trying to expand the capacity of the grid, and the law does not explicitly encourage domestic manufacturing, since the rules are anti-China rather than pro-America.
Trump’s tariffs also pose a unique threat to storage, because so many of the battery cells used in these projects come from China. The U.S. has only just begun building supply chains for lithium ferrous phosphate, the battery chemistry now favored for grid storage. [LG opened an LFP factory](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/lg-michigan-lfp-battery-factory) in Michigan this summer; AESC did so in an old Nissan Leaf battery plant in Tennessee, and [Tesla is working on one](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/batteries/tesla-just-launched-the-megablock-a-big-easy-to-deploy-grid-battery) in Nevada slated to start up early next year.
Now, said Brian Hayes, CEO of storage developer Key Capture Energy, it’s common for suppliers to offer three battery-sourcing options: China, Southeast Asia, and domestic. Buyers can toggle based on current tariff rates, U.S. manufacturing premiums, and the FEOC obligations of a particular project. Once the new FEOC rules kick in, though, the industry will need to move away from Chinese-made battery cells.
“I’m feeling a lot more positive today than I was six months ago,” said Hayes, whose company has built 40 megawatts in New York and 580 megawatts in Texas. “We ended up in a good place.”
That’s not to say storage developers can afford to get complacent.
“We can’t rest on our laurels,” Hayes mused. “We always have to be paying attention to what else could come.”
## **Domestic supply chains are developing in spite of the chaos**
The Biden administration combined trade policy with methodical domestic incentives to reshore the manufacturing of clean energy equipment and other tech, like semiconductors. Trump supports the resurgence of domestic manufacturing in theory, but his primary tactic for that goal has been frequently shifting and legally dubious tariffs. These policies raise the price for materials that American manufacturers need to make their products and for the equipment required to build new factories, and they undermine the long-term certainty that reassures investors.
Still, the reshoring of clean energy supply chains has continued, and signs touting FEOC compliance have become a new form of currency on the expo hall floors.

Nextracker, the homegrown solar-tracking manufacturer and publicly traded cleantech success story, used the occasion of the conference to publicize its acquisition of Origami Solar for $53 million. That marked a refreshing shift in an era when cleantech acquisitions have tended to feature [bankruptcy auctions](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/powin-bankrupt-grid-batteries) or the kind of firesale where participants abashedly refuse to share the purchase price.
Origami developed a steel frame technology to replace the usual aluminum frames that wrap around solar panels. This enhances structural integrity as solar modules grow ever larger and more powerful. Indiana manufacturer Bila Solar, for instance, recently 550-watt solar module.
But beyond preventing bending or buckling, the acquisition is a domestic-production play. The U.S. aluminium industry has 2025. The U.S. still makes things with steel though; Nextracker has been working with partners to [open steel plants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-manufacturing/can-energy-rich-pennsylvania-chart-a-path-towards-decarbonization) around the country to produce the torque tubes that carry the panels through their daily rotation. Origami manufactures in the U.S. too; now Nextracker can offer a more complete domestic solar package, making it easier for developers to clinch the 10% tax credit adder for Made-in-America content.
Over in Texas, module manufacturer Energy signed a deal a few weeks back with glass producer Corning for a lot more than ’s forthcoming solar cell factory starting in the second half of 2026.
I tracked down Alex Zhu, CEO of ES Foundry, which in January opened one of the only currently operating solar cell factories in the country. Production from the 1-gigawatt line in Greenwood, South Carolina, is already sold out until 2027, Zhu said. He has greenlit a 2-gigawatt expansion, slated to be fully running by June 2026, to meet demand from domestic panel producers. A digital display by the company’s booth advertised “No FEOC Ownership. No FEOC Board. No FEOC Funding.”
Zhu stressed that it wasn’t easy opening a cell factory when the U.S. lacks a supply chain for some of the industrial inputs that are abundant and cheap in China. One of the key gases used in the process cost him 120 times the rate it sells for in that country’s solar industry centers. But Zhu nonetheless raised investment, launched the company, and built the factory all in the last two years.
Sales of these U.S.-made cells very much depend on the domestic content adder to compete with cheaper imports: “That’s the only drive to make the economic sense to buy a more expensive domestic module and domestic cell,” Zhu noted.
That’s a clear risk factor, because that perk will disappear along with the solar tax credits. But tax rules say that if developers start construction before next July 4, they can take up to four years to finish projects. That means projects could get built with both the credit and the domestic content adder through the end of the decade.
It’s hard to know what context manufacturers will be operating in at that point. But Zhu noted that “after five years, we definitely need to move to the next generation.” Much like semiconductor fabs, solar cell factories must regularly refresh themselves to keep up with technological advancements.
Longer-term certainty would be nice for the generational effort to reshore the solar supply chain, but maybe five busy years of manufacturing is enough to look forward to right now.","Solar, Clean energy, Policy regulation",re-2025-conference-clean-energy-industry-outlook.md,articles_solar

Advocates say that’s false and promise to sue. 
Workers install solar panels at the St. Luke Baptist Church in Washington D.C., as part of a community solar project sponsored by Washington D.C.-based nonprofit Groundswell, a Solar for All grant recipient. (Groundswell)
The Trump administration has officially announced it is killing the [$7 billion Solar for All program](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/epa-community-solar-7-billion). The program had 60 state agencies, municipalities, tribal governments, and nonprofits across the country to [help low-income households access solar power](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/trump-looks-to-kill-solar-for-all-just-as-it-starts-to-deliver). Supporters of Solar for All are vowing to fight the move in court.
On Thursday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin posted a [$27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/climatetech-finance/epas-new-20b-green-bank-will-benefit-disadvantaged-communities-most) (GGRF), which has also been under attack by the Trump administration.
Zeldin stated that the [mega-law passed by Republicans in Congress last month](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/senates-big-beautiful-bill-would-be-a-disaster-for-clean-energy) “eliminates billions of green slush-fund dollars by repealing the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.”
Referring specifically to Solar for All, Zeldin said, “EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program, or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive. With clear language and intent from Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good.”
Defenders of Solar for All challenge Zeldin’s interpretation of the One Big Beautiful Bill, or HR 1, and the intent of its provisions.
“It is absolutely ludicrous to suggest that HR 1 rescinded these funds, because they were all under legally obligated grant awards when the bill was signed,” said Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environmental justice at Lawyers for Good Government, a nonprofit coalition of attorneys, law students, and activists that’s “HR 1 only rescinded unobligated grant funds,” she told Canary Media on Thursday.
That’s an important distinction, she said. Those unobligated grant funds amounted to only $19 million, as determined by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) when it conducted its analysis of the pending legislation’s overall financial impact. The vast majority of the funds, the office found, were already committed under legally binding contracts to the parties awarded grants during the Biden administration.
But in a court case challenging the EPA’s effort to [claw back $20 billion in funds](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/trump-admin-says-its-terminated-20b-green-bank-in-latest-escalation) for other GGRF programs, HR 1 terminates the government’s obligation to meet any of its contractual obligations.
Attorneys for nonprofit groups fighting EPA’s attempt to claw back their grants “ _unobligated_ balances of amounts made available to carry out that section … are rescinded.”
The attorneys also noted that Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, the West Virginia Republican and chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, stated during a congressional debate before the bill passed that funding “that’s already been obligated and out the door, that’s a decision that’s final,” and that arguing the law would claw back obligated funding is “a ridiculous thought.”
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) pointed out this same discrepancy in a EPA’s characterization of the law. “Trump’s DOJ is continuing its mischief by falsely claiming Republicans’ Big Beautiful-for-Billionaires Bill claws back $17 billion from GGRF, even though the CBO score for the unobligated funds was $19 million — what was left to oversee the program after the grant funds had been obligated — and Republicans made clear that their rescissions _only_ touched unobligated funding,” Whitehouse wrote.
The Solar for All program is meant to deliver energy-bill savings of $350 million over the next five years to 900,000 low-income and disadvantaged households and deploy 4 gigawatts of solar generation capacity. In the past few months, a handful of grantees had begun issuing awards to 
“Communities promised relief from punishing energy costs are now left in the dark,” Zealan Hoover, a former EPA senior advisor under the Biden administration, told Canary Media. “Nearly a million families will pay hundreds of dollars more each year for their electricity bill because the Trump administration killed a program that would have more than paid for itself.”
Michelle Moore, CEO of Groundswell, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit that is administering a $156 million Solar for All grant aimed at developing large-scale solar and battery projects in Southeastern states, said that ending the program would run counter to President Donald Trump’s pledge to lower energy prices.
“I would hope [the Office of Management and Budget] could find the funding to cover EPA staff time to help keep President Trump’s campaign promise to cut bills in half and keep energy affordable for American families, which this program does,” she told Canary Media.","Solar, Clean energy, Policy regulation, Politics",trump-administration-says-its-axing-7b-program-for-low-income-solar.md,articles_solar

Individuals and groups have planned “It’s going to be a beautiful day,” said Antonique Smith, a Grammy-nominated singer and actress who cofounded the nonprofit 
Inspired by Martin Luther King Jr.’s organizing in churches for the Civil Rights Movement, Smith visits houses of worship to explain that there’s an alternative to the fossil fuel plants that spew cancer-causing pollution disproportionately in disadvantaged neighborhoods.
“Clean energy and solar are so important, especially to communities of color and poor communities,” Smith told Canary Media. “How wonderful is it that we have this solution? … It’s not a luxury anymore.”
At climate events, Smith often “Here Comes the Sun” to honor the power of activism and clean energy. Her rendition is also the anthem for the upcoming day of action, and she’ll be performing the song at Sun Day extravaganzas in Brooklyn and Times Square, she said.
Sun Day will also give people a chance to reflect on the risks of a rapidly warming world, according to the Rev. Fletcher Harper, executive director of GreenFaith, a global interfaith environmental coalition. GreenFaith is working with more than 30 partner groups, representing a couple hundred congregations, that are hosting Sun Day gatherings, including a 
“When you look at the impacts of climate change — dangerous levels of heat, drought that forces small farmers around the world off of land that sustained their families for generations, fires that destroy people’s homes, and floods from severe storms — it’s the destruction of the environment that creates enormous human suffering,” Harper said. “It’s just wrong. … And the crime is that it’s preventable.”
The fossil fuel industry, having peddled its products “one of Dante’s inner circles,” he noted wryly.
## **The moment for a clean energy movement**
Sun Day’s organizers aim to spark a widespread popular movement whose influence is felt long after the day of action.
“People power is just this incredible way to unlock progress more quickly,” Henn said. “And that’s what we need to meet the kind of climate targets that we have in place.”
With all of its economic and societal advantages, clean energy might be inevitable, but “we can’t let this take 40 years,” he noted. “We need it to happen over the next five to 10 years, [which] will require a real mobilization.”
Solar and wind projects are increasingly hitting resistance at the local level.
“We’re just getting completely outplayed,” Henn said. The fossil fuel industry has “invested in front groups [and] field campaigns” to spread misinformation through Facebook and organize people against clean energy, he noted.
Sun Day will bring together people who can call on local leaders, regulators, and representatives to deliver clean energy now. Indeed, Fossil Free Media is already helping build those local grassroots networks, said Deirdre Shelly, who’s leading organizing efforts for the big day.
## **How to get involved in Sun Day**
Want to participate but not sure where to jump in? Start by checking out 350.org, EcoMadres, Sierra Club, Solar United Neighbors, and Third Act, to see if they’re looking for Sun Day volunteers.

https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/california-first-canal-array-project-nexus,California’s first solar-covered canal is now fully online,10 September 2025,Maria Gallucci,"The 1.6-MW pilot system is among a growing number of initiatives to put solar over waterways. The approach could generate gigawatts of power nationwide.

A novel solar power project just went online in California’s Central Valley, with panels that span across canals in the vast agricultural region.
The 1.6-megawatt installation, called 20 million state-funded pilot has turned stretches of the Turlock Irrigation District’s canals into hubs of clean electricity generation in a remote area where cotton, tomatoes, almonds, and hundreds of other crops are grown.
Project Nexus is only the second canal-based solar array to operate in the United States — and one of just a handful 2024 for the Pima and Maricopa tribes, known together as the Gila River Indian Community, on their reservation near Phoenix, Arizona. Two more canal-top arrays are already in the works there.
In California, the solar-canal system was built in two phases, with a 20-foot-wide stretch completed in March and a roughly 110-foot-wide portion finished at the end of August. Researchers will study the project’s performance over time, while a 
Proponents of this emerging approach say it can provide overlapping benefits.
Early research suggests that, along with producing power in land-constrained areas, putting solar arrays above water can help keep panels cool, in turn improving their efficiency and electricity output. Shade from the panels can also prevent water loss through evaporation in drought-prone regions and can limit algae growth in waterways.
Plus, solar canals could offer a faster path to clean energy development than utility-scale solar farms, especially in rural parts of the U.S. where big renewables projects increasingly face community opposition. Placing solar panels atop existing infrastructure doesn’t require altering the landscape, and the relatively small installations can be plugged into nearby distribution lines, avoiding the cumbersome process of connecting to the higher-voltage wires required for bigger undertakings. 
The 20-foot-wide section of Project Nexus came online in March 2025. (Turlock Irrigation District)
“Why disturb land that has sacred value when we could just put the solar panels over a canal and generate more efficient power?” said David DeJong, director of the Pima-Maricopa Irrigation Project, which is developing a water-delivery system for the Gila River Indian Community.
The purpose of these early arrays is primarily to power on-site canal equipment like pumps and gates. But such projects could eventually help clean up the larger grid, too. A coalition of U.S. environmental groups [previously estimated](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/can-americas-canals-double-as-solar-farms) that putting panels over 8,000 miles of federally owned canals and aqueducts could generate over 25 gigawatts of renewable energy — enough to power nearly 20 million homes — and reduce water evaporation by possibly tens of billions of gallons.
Still, the technology isn’t an obvious choice for many canal operators.
Elevating solar panels over canals is more expensive and technically complex than installing conventional ground-mounted solar arrays on trackers, and it can involve using more concrete and steel. Wider canals may also require support structures for panels within the waterway, which can disrupt the flow of water.
Earlier this year, a senior engineer at Arizona’s Salt River Project “based on cost estimates and project concerns,” after comparing the unique design to both rooftop and utility-scale solar alternatives.
Solar-canal developers are hoping they can still gain a toehold in irrigation districts that are grappling with high electricity costs and have limited options for generating cheap power, said Ben Lepley, the founder of engineering firm Tectonicus, which designed the Gila River Indian Community’s 1.3-MW system south of Phoenix.
The initial costs are “definitely higher … but it can actually be really fast as a project,” Lepley said. “By the next year, you can have really cheap electricity, and that gives [irrigation districts] stability over the 30-year life of the project.”
For its part, the Gila River Indian Community is building solar-canal projects as part of its broader mission to “generate enough renewable energy to completely offset the electrical use by the irrigation district,” said DeJong. He noted the district pays about $3 million a year for the 27 million kilowatt-hours of electricity it needs to pump, move, and store water.
The community built its [first solar-canal project](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/the-us-is-about-to-get-its-first-solar-covered-canal) over the Casa Blanca Canal with a nearly 25 million provision that supplied funding for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to design, study, and deploy projects that put panels over waterways. Irrigation districts in California, Oregon, and Utah 
The Trump administration is unlikely to support future programs, given its focus on gutting clean energy incentives, but a handful of projects are already moving forward without such grants.
DeJong said that construction is 90% complete on the tribal community’s second solar-canal project, a nearly 0.9-MW array built in partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is slated to go online later this year. The community is self-funding a similar-sized project over the Santan Canal and is developing a 2026. All told, the installations will provide 4 MW in local clean energy generation, he said.
“We have become really familiar with the economics of building these [canal] projects,” said Lepley, whose firm also worked on the Gila River Indian Community’s second and third solar-canal systems. “We have a pretty good playbook of how to continue these projects going forward, even without any grant funding from the federal government.”","Solar, Land use, West, California",california-first-canal-array-project-nexus.md,articles_solar
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/soft-costs-rooftop-solar-trump-budget-bill,Can cutting rooftop solar costs make up for losing tax credits?,23 July 2025,Jeff St. John,"Slow and complex permitting and interconnection rules drive up U.S. rooftop solar “soft” costs. With tax credits going away, fixing them may be existential. 
Rooftop solar costs way more in the United States than it does elsewhere in the world. That’s long been a headache for the sector to navigate. But now with Republicans in Congress killing off the decades-old tax credit for rooftop solar, it’s a life-or-death problem.
So says Andrew Birch, a 25-year industry veteran who’s built a career on cutting solar projects’ “soft costs,” which make up roughly 
Some of those factors are under a solar company’s control, like how much it spends on acquiring customers and managing projects. Others aren’t, like the expense associated with navigating complex permitting and interconnection processes that differ from city to city and from utility to utility.
Those costs rise when solar systems are accompanied by batteries, something that is becoming [increasingly common](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/chart-home-batteries-are-getting-way-more-popular) as households look for backup power and respond to new incentive structures that prioritize storage, as [is the case in California](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/batteries/battery-firms-set-to-thrive-under-new-california-rooftop-solar-regime), the nation’s largest rooftop solar market.
Big upfront costs are the GOP megabill will only make that hurdle higher. After this year, households will lose access to tax credits for 30% of the cost of solar, batteries, and other home clean-energy equipment, and companies that offer solar systems under third-party ownership models will face a set of uncertain restrictions that could choke off that part of the market.
In order for the U.S. to keep installing rooftop solar at a healthy rate — something that’s key to combatting climate change and helping people manage rising electricity costs and electrify their cars and homes — the industry needs to figure out how to prevent costs from ballooning once the incentives disappear.
“We’re now being forced to operate as an industry without subsidies,” Birch said. That puts the onus on the industry to both tighten its belt in areas that are under its control and press state lawmakers, local government officials, and utility regulators to reform their parts of the equation.
“We can survive and thrive — if we can reduce soft costs,” he said. 
Birch, a native Australian known as “Birchy” in the solar world, is working on just that himself.
He helped launch “instant permitting” software platform being [used by more than 160 cities and counties](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/software-aims-to-help-local-governments-standardize-streamline-solar-permitting) across the U.S. to process solar permits in hours rather than weeks. 
There’s plenty of evidence that lowering these costs is possible: The soft-cost problem is a bit of a uniquely American phenomenon. In other places with high rooftop solar penetration, like Australia, the 
Solar companies in Australia can quote, sell, and install a 7-kilowatt solar system with a 7 kilowatt-hour battery for about $14,000 in a matter of days, Birch estimated. In the U.S., that same system costs about $36,000, and getting permits and interconnections can take months — long enough to kill a fair number of installs before they can be completed, he said.
## **Streamlining permitting at cities and counties**
When it comes to cutting soft costs, local permitting reform is a big target.
Permitting regulations and processes vary widely across the roughly 23,000 city, county, and other local authorities that have jurisdiction over building permits, electrical code enforcement, and other must-haves for a solar or battery installation. Permitting can add SEIA).
Some do a good job of making the process smooth and straightforward. Others can be far less helpful and efficient. Slow or cumbersome permitting takes a toll on solar installers, stretching the time it takes to complete current projects and move on to the next.
“If you can ensure you’re making it through in three weeks versus three months, you’re operating much more efficiently,” said Barry Cinnamon, CEO of Northern California solar and battery installation firm “in cities where the permitting is slow, you inevitably get them coming back in two weeks saying, ‘You’re missing a dash in that form — send it back,’ and then two or three weeks later saying, ‘We’re not sure the battery can go in that spot. Try again.’”
It’s hard to standardize permitting across local authorities, which range from well-staffed big-city departments to tiny towns with one or two people working on it. But software that can reliably complete the tasks of permitting officials can save time and reduce errors for big and small permitting authorities alike.
In 2018, SEIA and nonprofit the Solar Foundation launched the 2020 proved it [dramatically sped up permitting](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/instant-permits-for-home-solar-theres-a-solarapp-for-that) without sacrificing quality, the platform was made available at large.
Automated permitting turns multiple back-and-forth processes into a “one- to two-page digital form,” Birch said. Code standards groups like Underwriters Laboratories and the International Code Council have signed off on SolarAPP+, and [similar automated platforms from startups](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/ai-powered-permitting-is-speeding-up-solar-deployments-in-california) and from city permitting departments are now providing similar same-day options.
The advantages of instant permitting are so great, Cinnamon said, that he’s stopped doing projects in cities and counties that don’t offer some form of it. With less than six months to finish projects that can secure tax credits, “we don’t have the time” to spend elsewhere, he said.
The next step is to expand instant permitting from hundreds to thousands of cities and counties by taking on statewide permitting reforms, said Nick Josefowitz, CEO of Permit Power, a nonprofit advocacy group.
Over the past several years, states including Democratic strongholds like 
Reform looks different in every state. California set mandates for cities and counties to use instant permitting, while Texas and Florida required cities and counties to allow licensed and credentialed third parties to issue permits and conduct inspections on homeowners’ behalf. Colorado’s law backed off on mandates but offered incentives for local authorities to deploy instant permitting, while New Jersey’s law would empower a state agency to set up instant permitting for cities and counties to use.
Lowering permitting costs can allow solar installers to cut their prices, which increases their business, spurs more competition, and gives households more options, Josefowitz said. A series of studies this year from Brown University’s Climate Solutions Lab and the Greenhouse Institute found that streamlined and instant permitting in 2 million home solar installations between now and 2030, saving households a collective $100 billion.
The results are good not just for households and solar installers but for cash-strapped municipalities, said Elowyn Corby, mid-Atlantic regional director for nonprofit group Vote Solar, which advocated for New Jersey’s newly passed reform bill.
“When you put the onus on municipalities to process these permit applications, that’s an enormous drain on their resources as well, especially in lower-income communities where there isn’t as much municipal infrastructure,” she said. “We’re hoping this brings capacity back to local governments.”
## **Streamlining utility interconnection processes**
Permits aren’t the only solar roadblocks. Utilities also need to approve solar and battery systems at homes connected to their grids before they’re allowed to be turned on. Solar installers have long complained that 
“I’ve heard from some of our installers — and some of the bigger ones — that the interconnection approval process is more of a challenge and a bigger cost than the permitting side,” said Ravi Mikkelsen, CEO of Atmos Financial, a financial technology company that connects lenders with solar installers and customers. “Some utilities are better than others, but across the board, this is a major issue.”
Interconnection rules are complicated, and utilities apply them differently. But reports from solar installers over the years have highlighted problems ranging from 
A lack of state regulator oversight for interconnection policies complicates efforts at reform, Josefowitz said.
Regulators in some states like [California set rules for all regulated utilities](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/distributed-energy-resources/californias-new-rules-allow-solar-and-batteries-to-help-out-the-grid), but other state regulators don’t. Even those that have set statewide guidelines for utilities have been slow to adopt rules that require them to put in place more streamlined processes or take the latest technology advances into account. A “best practices.” The groups gave only New Mexico an A grade and six other states B grades, while marking 13 with an F for lacking any statewide standards.
“We need [regulator] rules about when projects can be fast-tracked, what types of systems when and where can be automated and approved by software,” Josefowitz said. 
Extreme amounts of rooftop solar can cause problems on power grids designed to carry electrons from big substations to customers. 
“But batteries totally change the game on this,” he said, enabling homes to store solar power when utility grids don’t need it and release it when they’re in short supply.
That’s why solar companies ranging from [nationwide players like Sunrun](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/sunrun-ceo-says-utilities-slow-and-no-culture-gets-in-the-way-of-energy-innovation) to [regional and local installers](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/new-startup-aims-to-bring-solar-led-electrification-to-california-homes) are recasting their business approach to include becoming “virtual power plant” providers — active providers of energy and grid resources that help augment the resources that utilities can bring to bear.
Opportunities to earn money for these services are relatively scarce today. But with Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration making it much more expensive and difficult to build more renewable energy to meet the growing demand for electricity, utilities may be well advised to reduce the barriers to installing solar and batteries that can provide it, Mikkelsen pointed out.
“At $2 a watt, you can bring down the cost of your power, and you can save money on electrification,” he said. But also, “your battery can be used economically much more frequently and becomes super-valuable to the grid. You want to unlock the power of batteries? You fill them with cheaper electrons.”","Solar, Policy regulation",soft-costs-rooftop-solar-trump-budget-bill.md,articles_solar
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/illinois-ceja-energy-workforce-hub-alton-equity,Illinois’ push to train workers for solar industry jobs is paying off,12 September 2025,Kari Lydersen,"A state-funded hub for clean energy workforce development is creating employment and business opportunities in the surrounding community.

At 15, Kyle Barber started working at the Captain coal mine in southern Illinois — “following in the footsteps of my forefathers,” he says.
It was 1996, and the mine was closing, so his job involved swinging sledgehammers and scrambling down dangerously steep hillsides to retrieve huge rolls of discarded chain-link fence. He knew this was not the industry he wanted to spend his life working in.
Barber had long been fascinated by clean energy; he even won a grade school contest designing a solar canopy to go over highways. After graduating from college, he connected with the southern Illinois solar company AES to learn the trade, and in 2010 founded his own solar company, EFS. In 2017, he began teaching in a solar workforce training program in Peoria, Illinois, that was created by the state’s Future Energy Jobs Act (FEJA), which went into effect that same year.
Now, Barber is spreading the gospel of solar from the Scott Bibb Center at Lewis and Clark Community College in the southwestern Illinois city of Alton, on the banks of the Mississippi River. It’s one of 14 clean energy jobs hubs created by the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), successor to FEJA. And it shows how even in the wake of dire federal cuts to clean energy programs, a well-funded and thoughtfully implemented state program can foster a robust transition to renewables on the local level.
Barber has been on the faculty at Lewis and Clark since February 2020, originally teaching classes on solar CEJA allowed the school to bolster its offerings with wraparound social services and basic education, helping a wider range of students overcome barriers and prepare for careers in the industry.
With one of his former students, Richie Darling, Barber cofounded a nonprofit, CEJA workforce hubs and elsewhere around the state, including Richland Community College in Decatur, where leaders are [pinning their hopes on electric vehicle manufacturing](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-jobs/illinois-decatur-workforce-training).

Another of Barber’s proteges, Austin Frank, founded a solar company called ARF that installed a 100-kilowatt array on the Bibb Center roof. Thanks to federal and state incentives and labor donated by Frank’s company, the system cost the school nothing and saves the institution about $5,000 a month in energy bills, covering 40% of the building’s energy, he said. Frank has hired multiple graduates from Lewis and Clark.
“It all starts with Kyle,” said Darling. “It’s like vertical integration. We’re training people in solar, getting contractors set up, and then we have solar on the roof.”
## **Transitioning from coal**
For six decades, residents of Alton breathed pollution from the nearby Wood River coal plant. The plant closed in 2016, taking around 90 jobs with it, and the facility was 2021. Clean energy advocates 
Alton was founded more than 200 years ago at the confluence of the Mississippi, Illinois, and Missouri rivers. The city was once a booming industrial and commercial center, but its fortunes have declined as has its population, which now hovers near 25,000, though a smattering of trendy breweries, restaurants, and antique stores attract visitors from the St. Louis area and beyond.
The college qualified to be a workforce training hub under CEJA because the Alton area is home to a closed coal plant and because the state has deemed that the community was historically excluded from economic opportunities. CEJA prioritizes job creation and clean energy deployment in such spots, to make sure the clean energy transition benefits those who were harmed by or left out of the fossil fuel economy. 
Advocates applauded the law’s impact at a celebration of the Alton hub at Lewis and Clark last month. “Now because of CEJA,” said Francisco Lopez Zavala, climate policy program associate of the Illinois Environmental Council, hubs like the community college “are helping to build Illinois’s clean energy future, which in turn makes our air easier to breathe, our communities healthier, and our grid more resilient.”
Under CEJA, students are paid to take the clean energy and related basic skills courses. At Lewis and Clark, students can choose from four tracks: solar, energy efficiency, HVAC/ heat pumps, and a Climate Works pre-apprenticeship program affiliated with labor unions. Since launching last fall, the school’s program has graduated 57 students in 10 cohorts — five focused on solar, one on energy efficiency, one on HVAC, and three in pre-apprenticeship. Ninety-five percent of enrolled students have graduated, and eight companies, including ARF, have already hired graduates.
CEJA also sets aside money to reduce barriers for students, who can apply for funding for everything from car repairs and bus passes to electric bills and child care. This opportunity lasts for a full year after graduation. Each hub has a navigator organization that administers the aid; in Alton’s case, that’s Senior Services Plus, a social service agency that helps people of all ages.
“We’re bringing people from barely being able to get to class, because of barriers, to getting them hired,” Darling said.

During the August event, current students enthused about the program and the opportunities it creates. In one of the HVAC classes, Michael Mahon Jr. said he wants to set a good example for his daughter, and John Bone said he wants to solve the problems of greenhouse gases and ozone.
Chase Ellinger said that he is excited about the chance for a real career after bouncing between minimum-wage jobs in warehouses, bars, and landscaping. “I want to make a better world and contribute to something for real,” he added.
Other students were learning how to build energy-efficient tiny houses in a workshop on the college grounds.
Up on the roof of the Bibb Center, Frank’s employees were installing the latest addition to the solar array. Frank started his career in construction, working with his father. After a number of customers asked them about solar, “we were like, ‘Holy cow, this is the next big thing. We’ve got to get educated,’” Frank said. He enrolled in Lewis and Clark’s solar training program before it was funded by CEJA.
Following his graduation, he founded ARF Solar in 2021 and became an approved vendor for the Illinois Shines and Illinois Solar for All programs created by FEJA and expanded by CEJA. Illinois Shines provides incentives for residential, commercial, and community solar, and Illinois Solar for All offers even more robust support for [deploying solar](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/enn/in-illinois-energy-bill-negotiations-equity-is-taking-center-stage) in lower-income or environmental justice areas and hiring employees who meet equity-focused criteria.
ARF has installed systems on fire stations and other municipal buildings around southern Illinois, as well as schools and churches. Frank is also hoping to branch into community solar, which allows individuals to subscribe for access to energy from a shared array.
“The state had my back,” Frank said. “It created a program for small contractors like myself to come in and have a safe space where we’re able to grow.”
## **Opening doors**
People with criminal records are among those prioritized for CEJA’s equity-minded incentives, and at Lewis and Clark, multiple students and graduates said the solar training could provide a crucial job opportunity especially given barriers they’ve faced due to their pasts.
“I come from a background of poverty, addiction, and mental illness. I didn’t have anyone to teach me how to do life things,” program graduate Taryn Sensmeyer told visitors. “By the time I found recovery, I had created a lot more barriers to entry,” including “my colorful criminal history.”
She heard about the program from a friend who described it as “this weird thing you are totally going to love,” and she said the friend was right.
“I thought I’d just be showing up to learn how to install solar panels, but I got comprehensive knowledge of the whole industry and a deep passion for the environment.”
She’s now participating in an apprenticeship that will prepare her to become a journeyman electrician.
“For the first time, I can put food on the table without any outside help,” Sensmeyer said. “It’s had a ripple effect on everyone I come in contact with.”
Zachary Resmann, a current student in Barber’s class, grew up on an Illinois dairy farm and worked in solar sales. But he felt he was being taken advantage of by out-of-state solar companies flocking to the Illinois market to cash in on incentives, especially for community solar. He joined the CEJA program in hopes of becoming a contractor himself, and his background qualifies him to tap into the law’s equity funds and services. He plans to become an approved vendor under Illinois Shines and Illinois Solar for All, and develop residential arrays for the many friends and acquaintances who have asked him about solar.
“Solar power is power by the people for the people,” said Resmann, who founded the company Resolute Energy Solutions, which helps customers interested in solar, energy efficiency, and other services get quotes and connect with suppliers. “With four kids and a felony, it was hard to get hired. This has changed my life and given me hope.”
In October, a clean energy job fair will be held at the college. Resmann noted Barber’s determination to get his graduates good “” jobs — rather than independent contractor gigs that entail 1099 tax forms.
Barber grew up near the massive Baldwin coal plant, which is 2027 — an extension from a previous 2025 closing date. A lot of renewables will be needed to replace the 1,185-megawatt plant. A 68-MW solar array and 2-MW energy storage system have already been built on its site, under the state’s coal-to-solar program.
With such demand plus state incentives and training programs, Barber is confident the solar industry has strong prospects in Illinois, despite [federal rollbacks](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/chart-rooftop-solar-set-to-struggle-under-gop-tax-credit-repeal).
“Under CEJA, there is truly no limit to the number of jobs, companies, projects we can create,” he told visitors to Lewis and Clark in August. “There is no magic; it’s just hard work and determination to create a cleaner and brighter future here in Illinois.”","Solar, Clean energy, Workforce diversity, Midwest, Illinois",illinois-ceja-energy-workforce-hub-alton-equity.md,articles_solar
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/rooftop-crash-tax-credit-republican-bill,Chart: Rooftop solar could tank if GOP repeals key tax credit,20 June 2025,Dan McCarthy,"Congressional Republicans are poised to eliminate a tax credit that makes rooftop solar cheaper for homeowners, the latest in a string of blows to the sector. 
_See more from_ _[Canary Media’s “Chart of the week” column](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/columns/chart-of-the-week)._
Rooftop solar is already struggling in the U.S. — but the budget bill passed by House Republicans last month would send the sector into a tailspin. 
Just 2 gigawatts of residential solar would be installed in 2026 if the bill passes in its current form, according to 60% lower than the 5.1 GW installed last year.
The reason for this projected sharp decline is that the GOP budget bill, now under consideration in the Senate, would eliminate federal tax credits for residential solar within six months. These long-standing incentives were renewed for another decade under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and [can make solar 30% cheaper for homeowners](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-free-buildings/home-energy-tax-credits-budget). 
It’s bad timing for those hoping to lower their energy costs by installing rooftop solar. Across the country, [utility bills are rising](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/rising-gas-electric-bills-survey), and the budget bill and other Trump administration actions[ impeding clean energy development](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/republican-bill-tax-credits-risk) are expected to [drive the price of energy up](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/ira-tax-credits-electric-bills) further. 
Most households that install rooftop solar 
But without these tax credits, installing rooftop solar will be significantly more expensive — putting it out of reach for many, especially the lower-income residents who stand to benefit the most. It would take the average homeowner five or six years longer to break even on their solar system if incentives disappear, per Ohm Analytics.
The tax-credit repeal would be only the latest blow to residential solar in the U.S., 6.8 gigawatts of panels were put on rooftops across the country. 
That same year, California, the country’s largest residential solar market, [slashed the amount of money](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/california-derailed-its-booming-rooftop-solar-buildout-can-it-be-fixed) households can earn from selling solar power back to the grid, eroding the economics of solar as a result.

President Donald Trump’s new budget law repeals a key federal tax incentive for residential solar — and rooftop solar installations are about to plunge as a result.
Americans are expected to install 33% less rooftop solar next year than they would if federal incentives were still in place, per an [forecast](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/rooftop-crash-tax-credit-republican-bill), which was based on a version of the law that would have also scrapped a separate tax credit that applies to leased systems.
The repeal of the tax credit, which [knocks 30% off the price of home solar and storage](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/tax-credit-changes-trump-law), will make the technology significantly more expensive. The incentive was originally available until 2035 but now disappears at the end of this year.
Already, residential solar is [far more expensive](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/soft-costs-rooftop-solar-trump-budget-bill) in the U.S. than elsewhere, and high interest rates as well as recent state-level policy developments are eating further into the economics of buying panels. Even before the repeal, rooftop solar installations were declining year over year because of these trends.

We’re in the midst of a global solar revolution. Don’t believe it? Just look at the latest numbers. 
In the first six months of this year, the world built 64% more new solar energy capacity than it did in the first half of 2024, 380 gigawatts’ worth of solar installed through June of this year is roughly equal to the amount of solar installed in all of 2021 and 2022 _combined._
The story of this global solar boom is, really, the story of solar growth in China. 
The country, which is the world’s largest producer of solar equipment and most other clean-energy technologies, on its own deployed 256 GW of new solar over the first half of this year — more than two-thirds of the global total. That’s double the amount it installed during the same period last year. 
China’s rapid buildout of solar is welcome news. The country emits more planet-warming greenhouse gases than any other, in large part because it burns prodigious amounts of coal to produce electricity for its 1.4 billion citizens. But solar and other renewables are now putting enough of a dent in the country’s coal use that some analysts 
Outside of China, the rest of the world installed just 15% more solar capacity in the first half of this year than it did in the first half of last year. 
The two next-biggest solar installers over this time period were India, at 24 GW, and the U.S., at 21 GW. The U.S. is still managing to push solar to new heights despite the Trump administration’s attacks on clean energy. 
Overall, solar provided just 7% of electricity generated around the globe last year. That percentage needs to increase — fast — so the world can ditch fossil fuels and bend the emissions curve downward. Luckily, solar has so far proven up to the challenge of growing at an astonishing rate.","Solar, Clean energy",global-solar-power-energy-installations-booming.md,articles_solar
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/illinois-farmers-graze-sheep-agrivoltaics,Illinois farmers find that sheep and solar arrays go well together,11 September 2025,Kari Lydersen,"The agrivoltaics practice of raising sheep under solar panels is a win-win for Illinois farmers — but first the market for lamb meat needs to grow. 
Sheep graze among solar panels in Illinois. (Pivot Energy)
To all the challenges the solar industry is facing today, add one more: cultivating a domestic market for lamb meat. It may seem an unlikely mission for clean-energy developers, but in many states, including Illinois, grazing sheep between rows of photovoltaic panels is considered the most efficient form of agrivoltaics — the combination of solar and farming on the same land.
Solar advocates, researchers, and developers have given much attention to agrivoltaics. The practice includes growing crops like blueberries, tomatoes, or peppers in the shade of solar panels and letting cows or sheep graze around the arrays.
Perhaps the biggest benefit of agrivoltaics is that land is not being taken out of agricultural production in favor of clean energy, a concern that has stoked intense opposition to solar. The Trump administration codified this sentiment when the head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 19 that the agency “will no longer fund taxpayer dollars for solar panels on productive farmland.”
Illinois’ sprawling fields of corn and soybeans don’t coexist well with solar panels, but sheep do, making grazing a promising type of agrivoltaics for the state, proponents say.
In a typical solar grazing arrangement, sheep farmers (called grazers) are paid by solar developers to bring the animals to sites hosting large arrays — often farms — where they munch away on the vegetation. Meanwhile, the landowner benefits from lease payments. Grazing is a lower-emissions alternative to mechanical mowing, and sheep can reach corners that mowers can’t.
But to make a living herding sheep, the grazers need to be able to sell the lambs they raise as meat. In the U.S., lamb is sold primarily in halal markets and appears on menus only during Easter holidays. 
“What there needs to be, honestly, is more demand for lamb in the country,” said Stacie Peterson, executive director of the American Solar Grazing Association, which offers solar grazing certifications and contract templates. “We’re hoping to help develop more breeding stock, more farmers, more grazers doing this.”
## **A taste for lamb**
Brooke Watson would like to see demand for lamb soar in the Midwest, in tandem with demand for solar grazing. Brooke’s husband, Chauncey Watson IV, has been raising sheep since he was in , a program that teaches kids about agriculture. Chauncey’s family has farmed in Illinois since 1856. The couple has raised lambs and sheep for wool, but in 2023 they bought a new flock of “hair sheep,” which don’t need shearing, to give solar grazing a try. “Hooves on the ground” happened last summer, Brooke said. Now they have 500 ewes grazing on over 320 acres at nine community solar sites in six Illinois counties.
Brooke laments that Americans “lost their taste for lamb” after World War II — because veterans had grown tired of wartime canned lamb rations, according 
“It has picked up in the last few decades, but more so with immigrant communities, where lamb is that really valuable cultural and religious product,” she said, adding that “traditional beef and chicken consumers” should give lamb a chance. “There’s really a huge, huge potential for both of these industries to grow and evolve together side by side.”
Brooke said solar grazing can also provide a way for younger farmers to stay in the business.
“The landowner most typically is hitting retirement age, and they don’t want to work the land anymore. So solar is a way for them to still maintain ownership of that parcel, and they’re compensated to host the solar on the site” while collaborating with farmers like her and her husband, who are typically “younger, maybe first generation or newer farmers, and they’re excited about the sheep grazing.”
## **A novelty in Illinois**
According to a 2024, almost 62,000 sheep were grazing over 87,000 acres at 109 solar sites in the South, with more than half of the animals in Texas. In the Midwest, including Illinois, just over 13,000 sheep grazed almost 7,000 acres of solar at 148 sites.
Texas and California have long histories of shepherding, and in many areas sheep are central to the ranching culture. That means grazing sheep under solar panels is continuing these areas’ traditional agriculture.
But in Illinois, there is little history of raising sheep. So converting acres of the state’s primary corn and soybean fields may still raise eyebrows.
“In Europe, solar grazing has taken off, but they are much more into sheep,” said Ken Anderson, director of the Advanced Energy Institute at Southern Illinois University. “When you see sheep move into Illinois, it’s unfamiliar to people; they’re not used to seeing sheep. It’s better with cattle, but cattle are harder — they like to scratch. It can do damage to the panels.”
Solar grazing goats, meanwhile, has been “a disaster,” Anderson said, because they chew wires and other parts of solar arrays. He is working on a proposed agrivoltaics research site that would grow peaches, apples, and other specialty crops amid solar panels on a former military munitions site in Illinois. Anderson prefers growing crops under panels to grazing, but crops need more specialized solar configurations.
Solar panels suited for sheep are “strictly industrial arrays,” he said. “All you’re going to be able to do is graze sheep there in the future, so you need to think about the long haul.”
Sheep may be the state’s best option for large arrays because, Anderson thinks, there’s limited potential for solar panels to occupy the same land as the state’s traditional sprawling corn and soybean fields.
“In my opinion, the economics will never work,” for pairing corn and soy with solar, Anderson said. “When you grow broad-acreage crops like corn and soy, you use very large equipment, so you have to put the panels far apart,” resulting in less energy output.
While solar grazing in Illinois might often replace corn or soybean production, Watson sees it as a positive trade-off.
“So much of that corn is used for ethanol production, and so much of that soy is, quite frankly, exported to other countries,” she said. “So we really look at solar grazing as an opportunity to have more U.S.-sourced energy production and food production as well.”
The Watsons work with a solar developer called Pivot Energy. Since 2021, agrivoltaics has been the company’s main focus, according to director of operations and maintenance Angie Burke. In Illinois, Pivot Energy has 365 sheep grazing at 11 sites, and those numbers are projected to more than double by next year.
“Agrivoltaics is this great way to support those family farmers locally and provide that cost-competitive, locally sourced, and high-protein-value food for those communities that are excited to eat more lamb,” Burke said.
## **Improving the land**
While solar grazing may not be more profitable than mechanical mowing for landowners, it leaves the soil in better condition than if it were left idle under the panels.
“Let’s be delicate — [the sheep] are contributing to the soil” with their excrement, said Anderson.
In climates like Illinois’, sheep must be housed and fed inside during winter — a considerable expense. But Brooke Watson noted that, unlike solar grazers in Western states, she and her husband don’t need to provide much water for sheep in summer, as the lush vegetation and frequent rain suffice. In any state, solar grazing means ensuring that there are safe fences or wires around sites and that predators are kept out.
“In the early days, there were some horror stories where people dropped sheep off and came back at the end of the summer and there weren’t any sheep anymore,” said Ethan Winter, national smart solar director of American Farmland Trust, an organization committed to farmland preservation and sustainable farming practices. “You’re starting to see more professionalization, more formalized best practices for grazers.”
The organization United Agrivoltaics connects would-be grazers with solar developers and provides resources for insurance and contracts, Winter added.
American Farmland Trust’s Midwest solar specialist Alan Bailey noted that existing crop residue or debris must be cleared and specific cover crops planted to prepare for solar grazing, but this can happen while an array is being built. “One of our principles is having some sort of living cover on those sites throughout the entire construction process,” he said.
Because solar grazing’s benefits to the land and environment are well established, Winter said, boosting the lamb market is “the next big step” for expansion.
“There’s both the need and opportunity to think about markets for the lamb,” Winter said, noting that the animals could be sold to wholesale processors or marketed locally. “There may be a real advantage in having the Illinois Solar Lamb label.”","Solar, Food and farms, Midwest, Illinois",illinois-farmers-graze-sheep-agrivoltaics.md,articles_solar

Some made an unusual move to side with America’s economic foe: China. 
International negotiations wrapped last month at the headquarters of the United Nations-affiliated International Seabed Authority in Kingston, Jamaica. (Clare Fieseler/Canary Media) 
KINGSTON, Jamaica — The Trump administration is on a rogue quest to mine critical minerals from the ocean floor — and recent global negotiations over the fate of deep-sea mining reveal just how alone the U.S. is on the issue.
The deep-sea treasure that the administration seeks are lumpy, potato-sized rocks known as polymetallic nodules. They litter the mucky bottom of deep ocean areas across the planet. But in the 1970s, companies discovered that nodules in remote stretches of the Pacific Ocean contain high concentrations of several critical minerals, including many used today to make the lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles.
Most of the world’s high-value nodules are found in international waters located between Hawaii and Mexico. Since 1994, when the United Nations Law of the Sea treaty went into effect, diplomats from most of the world’s countries have met annually to negotiate if and how to allow companies to extract those nodules for profit. No large-scale mining has yet taken place.
Last month, delegates from France, Russia, China, and most of the world’s other major economies gathered to continue those negotiations in a conference center in Kingston, Jamaica, overlooking the city’s turquoise coastal waters. The U.S., which is the only major country that hasn’t ratified the 1994 treaty, participated as an “observer.”
During the negotiations, run by the United Nations affiliate known as the International Seabed Authority, little progress was made on the specific task at hand: finalizing a code that would permit commercial mining on the high seas under the Law of the Sea.
Instead, during the two final days, the high-stakes deep-sea mining talks devolved into a public airing of grievances against the United States — including by several of the country’s allies, who, in an unusual move, have started to align more with China over the U.S. in the increasingly contentious fight.
That’s because President Donald Trump has been pushing the U.S. to barrel ahead on deep-sea mining. The country plans to permit mining in international waters under an obscure U.S. law from 1980 called the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act, which predates the Law of the Sea treaty. Congress wrote the law to serve as an “interim legal regime” — a temporary way to grant mining licenses until the United Nations-affiliated regime took shape.
Many legal experts worry that invoking the antiquated act now is a violation of international law.
For years, a handful of private firms have pushed the international community to green-light deep-sea mining, which they argue offers a less environmentally destructive path than land-based mining for acquiring the metals needed for the clean-energy transition. Scientists, environmental advocates, and others, meanwhile, have fiercely criticized the idea, calling into question the claim that deep-sea mining is the lesser of two evils — or even an economically feasible enterprise.
The Trump administration’s new push to unilaterally license mining was seen as a slap in the face to the dozens of countries meeting in Jamaica last month. Delegates emphasized that the International Seabed Authority is the only entity legally authorized to permit mining in ocean areas that lie beyond nations’ jurisdictions.
A main point of contention is that, according to the U.N. treaty, the international seabed is designated the “
“The ocean is not there to affirm the leadership of a single country at the expense of all others and the multilateral process,” boomed Olivier Poivre d’Arvor, France’s special envoy of the president for the ocean and poles, in a statement read on July 21, kicking off the final week of negotiations. 
From July 21 to July 25, the U.N.-affiliated International Seabed Authority hosted the annual assembly of countries that are party to the Law of the Sea. This year's negotiations failed to finalize a code that would open up the high seas to mining. (Clare Fieseler/Canary Media) 
Poivre d’Arvor framed the U.S.’s plan as prioritizing its own economic benefit and rivalry with China, the global leader in critical-minerals production, over the interests of humankind.
“Do we want to see, against our will, an increase of $300 billion in the United States’ gross domestic product over the next 10 years? And this for the sole desire to get ahead of China in this field, which — by the way — has announced nothing of the sort and respects the rules of the game?” he posed during negotiations, an escalation in rhetoric after months of

NOAA to commercially mine the high seas just five days later. But NOAA first needs to develop a framework for approving permits before it can green-light this one. The agency is doing so by updating the 1980 minerals act; its proposed revisions are 5.
The U.S. delegation remained largely silent while France and others criticized its moves. It defended its deep-sea mining policy in writing instead of in the customary way, with a publicly read statement.
A member of the Chinese delegation called the U.S.’s explanation “unacceptable.” It omits key facts, the Chinese delegate said, about America’s long history of obeying and endorsing international law regarding the high seas. China was the first country to publicly condemn Trump’s deep-sea mining order in April, but Brazil and Panama took the floor at last month’s meeting in Jamaica to publicly side with China for the first time against America’s new stance.
The U.S. delegation declined to comment further when reached by Canary Media.
Duncan Currie, an international law expert based in New Zealand, told Canary Media during the negotiations that China is largely right when it comes to the U.S. being legally beholden to the treaty, even if the country never chose ratification. According to Currie, America’s active participation in annual meetings means that, under international law, the U.S. can’t claim to be a “persistent objector,” which could exempt it from the treaty’s terms.
The Law of the Sea does more than regulate the seabed. It keeps peace for U.S. fisheries, naval operations, and cargo shipping, and enforces the country’s maritime boundaries. In this way, he explained, Trump’s executive order not only flouts international law, which currently prohibits unilateral mining activities in the high seas, but also threatens the bedrock law protecting American maritime industries like fishing and cargo shipping.
Trump’s push for deep-sea mining faces challenges beyond resistance from other countries.
The main commercial minerals that nodules contain are cobalt, manganese, copper, and nickel. These minerals are currently used in most of the lithium-ion batteries that go in EVs, but it’s unclear how much the auto industry will need in the coming decades. Notably, China has already moved away from using cobalt, manganese, and nickel in its EV batteries, preferring models that require [lithium, iron, and phosphate](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/a-new-generation-of-cheaper-batteries-is-sweeping-the-ev-industry) — all of which are more abundant on land.
Even if they are needed, the market for deep-sea minerals may be lukewarm. Already, 64 companies, including major EV makers BMW and Volvo, have taken a stand against sourcing seabed metals without an international code in place. Meanwhile, analysts expect [GOP megabill](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/senates-big-beautiful-bill-would-be-a-disaster-for-clean-energy) passed in July, which eliminates key EV tax credits for consumers.

1 deadline.
## **Exception redemption? A path forward**
AB 130 does allow for some exceptions that could let local governments implement stricter building requirements even after the cutoff date.
The law permits the state commission and local governments to update building codes in emergencies to protect health and safety. Perhaps the climate emergency will qualify, said Kelly Lyndon, cochair of the advocacy alliance San Diego Building Electrification Coalition.
Cities and counties can also adopt updates that are necessary to carry out greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategies spelled out in their state-mandated general plans. These road maps must have been adopted by June 10, 2025, and code updates can’t ban gas.
“At least one of these exceptions is going to work for folks who want to make further progress on climate,” said Merrian Borgeson, director of California policy with the Natural Resources Defense Council’s Climate Energy Program. “Unfortunately … [AB 130] makes it more complicated and creates more red tape.”
Vespa pointed out that many jurisdictions may be able to take advantage of the exception for preexisting aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Among the 482 city plans, 52 of 58 county general plans.
Sacramento’s “a continued focus on improving the performance of both new and existing buildings.” A local code update to swap old air conditioners with heat pumps could fit within AB 130’s exemption, Vespa said.
But it’s too soon to say who might try the strategy first. “Some jurisdictions are really looking towards their legal experts to interpret [the exception language],” said Madison Vander Klay, senior manager of government affairs at the nonprofit Building Decarbonization Coalition.
But even with its exclusions, the moratorium “is a big problem for emissions, affordability, and cost savings,” Vander Klay said.
Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas (D) and Assemblyperson Nick Schultz (D), who authored the initial standalone bill to pause building codes, AB 130.
“California home prices are double the national average, and the rent is too damn high. So many folks cannot afford to live in California,” Schultz “This pause … will provide stability and certainty in the housing construction market by temporarily freezing the standards by which people need to meet to construct their home.”
It’s unclear whether the bill will actually make homes more affordable, though. “Building codes have never been what drives high costs in California — certainly not the energy code,” Borgeson said.
A LA for Pacific Gas Electric backs that up; the authors noted that they couldn’t find a statistically significant relationship between California’s energy-efficiency code and home construction costs.
“There isn’t a lot of evidence that waiving codes helps affordability,” Vander Klay said. “The building codes overall are required [by law] to be cost-effective.” Any up-front costs must be outweighed by savings.
The standards have delivered, sparing Californians more than 4.8 billion in savings over 30 years.
Research also shows that building all-electric homes is typically faster and cheaper than building those with gas. A 2019 analysis by energy consultancy , for example, estimated that building a new all-electric home in most parts of California 2022 study by the New Buildings Institute found that constructing an all-electric single-family home in New York costs about UC Berkeley team used these and other findings to conclude in an April report that the LA fires is likely all-electric.
With the moratorium, the commission will have to skip the 2028 residential code cycle. That omission could result in tens of millions of dollars in [lost utility bill savings for households](https://assets.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Frontier-Energy-Analysis-AB306-on-Energy-Code-Impacts.pdf), according to the Building Decarbonization Coalition. Notably, the commission will be able to work on the following code update, so it can take effect as planned in 2032.
In the wake of AB 130, the Building Decarbonization Coalition’s Vander Klay is urging the Legislature to reauthorize California’s successful cap-and-trade program to support home electrification by making heat pumps and other decarbonizing tech more affordable. “There is still an opportunity … this year for the state to look at carving out funding to provide incentives,” she said.
In passing AB 130, state lawmakers took aim at rules that they contend stifle development. Underpinning this strategy is a notion popularized by a recent book, “Abundance.” Authors Ezra Klein of The New York Times and Derek Thompson, contributing writer at The Atlantic, make the case that well-intentioned but overly protective regulations can foster scarcity — in this case, of housing — and thus interfere with leaders’ ability to deliver on the promises of a better life.
But Vander Klay argues that lawmakers should view strong building codes as a way to help create abundance. “Abundance is this idea that we should all have access to housing, we should all be able to afford our energy bills … we should all be able to have access to clean air and clean water and healthy homes,” Vander Klay said.
Clean energy technologies like heat pumps are part of an abundant, safer, more climate-resilient future, she noted. “We have building codes as a tool to support building what we need safely and quickly and affordably.”","Carbon-free buildings, Energy efficiency, Policy regulation, West, California",ca-ab-130-code-housing.md,articles_carbon-free-buildings

**Solar for none?**
The U.S. EPA [says it will roll back](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/trump-administration-says-its-axing-7b-program-for-low-income-solar) more federal clean energy funding, this time targeting $7 billion earmarked for states, cities, tribes, and nonprofits under the Solar for All program. The program was created under the Biden administration to help low- and moderate-income households tap into solar power that can help lower their electricity bills.
The clawback comes just as grant awardees were starting to spend their federal dollars. Just this week, [Canary Media’s Jeff St. John reports](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/trump-looks-to-kill-solar-for-all-just-as-it-starts-to-deliver), burgeoning projects all across the country could lose their funding, threatening new power generation that the U.S. needs if it wants to lower electricity prices and meet rising demand.
Advocates say the EPA doesn’t have the authority to claw back the money and promised on Thursday to sue, [as Jeff reports in a follow-up piece](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/trump-administration-says-its-axing-7b-program-for-low-income-solar).
**A week of blows to renewables**
It’s not just residential solar that’s in the Trump administration’s crosshairs. The administration has also issued a series of orders over the last two weeks targeting solar and wind development on federal lands and in federal waters.
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum started by “preferential treatment for wind projects” and to evaluate whether to halt wind development on federal lands altogether. The next day, the Interior Department de-designated more than 3.5 million acres of federal waters previously slated for wind development, rendering offshore wind leasing “effectively dead” in the U.S., [Canary Media’s Clare Fieseler reports](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-interior-revokes-leasing-areas).
Back on land, the DOI also “density” before it’s approved. It’s a test that wind and solar are destined to fail, as they take up more land than gas power plants to generate the same amount of electricity.

https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-free-buildings/san-francisco-renovations-gas-ban,San Francisco fast-tracks all-electric standard for major renovations,8 August 2025,Alison F. Takemura,"With the state set to pause code updates in October, the city is racing to close what some saw as a loophole in its existing all-electric building code. 
San Francisco already requires most new buildings to eschew gas and run solely on electricity. Now, the metropolis is moving to ensure that substantial renovations in existing buildings are also all-electric.
Last week, the city and county’s Board of Supervisors completed the first of two votes to pass the 2, according to the San Francisco Environment Department, the agency that developed the rules.
“We can’t build the San Francisco of the future with fuel from the past,” Board of Supervisors President Rafael Mandelman said “This legislation picks up where we left off with the 
The proposed ordinance was years in the making, but the city is now fast-tracking its approval before a new [statewide pause on updates to building codes](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-free-buildings/ca-ab-130-code-housing) kicks in. Under the law, signed in June, San Francisco and other jurisdictions in the Golden State have only until Oct. 1 to adopt stronger building codes unless they claim an exception.
San Francisco can’t meet its climate goals unless it moves buildings away from fossil fuels. The city has vowed to slash carbon pollution by 61% from 1990 levels by 2030 and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040 — five years faster than California as a whole. Buildings in San Francisco account for 44% of the city’s planet-warming pollution, the largest emitter after transportation, at 45%.
If enacted, the new ordinance will affect projects that are similar in scope to new construction, including additions as well as renovations that rip out mechanical systems. It won’t bear on single equipment replacements, however, like replacing a gas furnace.
The ordinance essentially “closes a loophole” in the new construction requirement, Cyndy Comerford, climate program manager at the SF Environment Department, told Canary Media. For example, on the same downtown parcel of a five-story brick building, a “That addition was allowed to have gas in it when it was a totally separate building.” The new ordinance would put a stop to similar cases in the future.
Lawmakers are leaving room for exceptions to the all-electric standard, including restaurants that use gas for cooking, buildings composed of 100% affordable housing units (with gradual compliance after July 2027), and projects that can’t get enough power from the utility in time. Building owners would seek exemptions from the SF Environment Department.
In many cases, the cost of all-electric construction is actually lower than that of mixed-fuel buildings, according to the department. Summarizing several analyses, it estimates that newly built or majorly renovated all-electric single-family homes are cheaper than conventional construction by 
Contrast that to the higher estimated costs to switch to all-electric appliances _after_ construction. The department estimates such retrofits would cost San Francisco homeowners an added $2 to $4 per square foot.
And all-electric retrofits are coming.
In 2023, San Francisco Bay Area air regulators [passed landmark rules](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/bay-area-officials-vote-to-ditch-new-gas-furnaces-and-water-heaters) to phase out the sale of gas-burning water heaters by 2027 and furnaces by 2029 for single-family homes. When old combustion appliances conk out after those dates, homeowners will need to foot the bill to replace them with zero-emissions units. The same will hold for multifamily building owners by 2031.
“Developers aren’t always incentivized to think [about] who’s going to be living in this property 10 or 15 years from now,” said Tyrone Jue, director of the SF Environment Department. “And that’s where government has to step in to say … ‘Yes, we want you to build housing, but we want you to do it smartly so that we don’t end up having to carry the financial burden down the road.’”[Fossil gas](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/we-need-to-talk-about-how-we-talk-about-natural-gas) also carries heavy social costs.

These by-products can lead to respiratory disorders, cardiovascular disease, and premature death. 
“As a city, we’re responsible for the well-being of our citizens,” Comerford said.
Gas lines are also a particular liability in the earthquake-prone region. Liquefaction of the earth can sever underground pipelines, which are more prone to damage than the city’s electrical system, Jue said. In a Electric estimated that after a 7.9 earthquake, it would take up to six months to restore gas services citywide; electricity could be brought back on line in two weeks.
The all-electric renovations ordinance comes as the federal government is rolling back environmental regulations and [pushing for more fossil fuel use](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/cost-trump-keep-coal-open), not less. “This is a moment for cities like San Francisco to step up,” Jue said. “And this is San Francisco drawing a clear line, not waiting for permission from Washington to protect our people, our health, and the planet.”","Carbon-free buildings, Policy regulation, West, California",san-francisco-renovations-gas-ban.md,articles_carbon-free-buildings

Takemura,"Historic buildings are hard to electrify. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey pulled it off for a landmark structure while preserving its Art Deco flair. 
The all-electric retrofit of the nearly century-old Building One included installing heat pumps, EV chargers, and electric boilers. (Port Authority of New York and New Jersey)
The first passenger terminal for air travel in the U.S. was an Art Deco celebration of aviation. In 1935, the fearless Amelia Earhart 
Now an administrative center called Building One, the former terminal has made history for a new reason: It’s the first edifice owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a bistate transportation agency, to undergo an all-electric retrofit.
“It’s so exciting to see [this kind of] reinvestment and making things new again,” said James Lindberg, senior policy director at the nonprofit National Trust for Historic Preservation, who wasn’t involved in the project. “Energy efficiency and decarbonization is part of that. … We know how to do it — we just need more of it.”
Buildings account for a whopping 
Retrofitting any existing structure is going to be tougher than going with all-electric systems from the start. But engineers looking to upgrade historic buildings are doubly constrained by the need to maintain their charges’ distinctive architectural features; you can’t just tear down the walls of a landmark.
The Port Authority’s Building One is an early example demonstrating that storied buildings can be electrified — all while keeping their vaunted status intact.
It “was the perfect project to show the art of what’s possible,” said Dennis Pietrocola, director of operations services at the Port Authority. “If we were able to undergo an electrification transformation to Building One” — among the most challenging of the Port Authority’s structures — “then it sets the stage for [decarbonizing] the rest.”
That’s coming. The Port Authority 1,000 buildings — from storage and parking structures to terminals to offices — at its airports, bridges, tunnels, railways, bus stops, and shipping ports.
In the 1930s, hundreds of thousands of airline passengers trod across the terrazzo floor of Building One’s lobby. (Port Authority of New York and New Jersey)
## **Heat pumps, electric boilers, and more**
Building One is the bustling home base of 190 Port Authority employees, including operations and maintenance workers, police, and firefighters. In 2023, the building’s gas-fueled equipment was ready to conk out, making it a prime candidate for a decarbonization retrofit. Pietrocola and his colleagues carefully planned a series of cost-effective electrifying updates and hired an experienced general contractor, Constellation NewEnergy, to carry them out.
The team installed five large heat pumps on the roof to provide zero-emissions heating and cooling. They put in an energy-recovery system to recycle waste heat from the locker and IT rooms. The crew added a system that can dial down power use when the grid is strained by high demand. And in the parking lot, workers installed 29 new charging ports for electric vehicles.
The team also swapped the building’s gas boilers with electric-resistance ones. Operating with the same physics as big electric tea kettles, these provide an extra boost as needed to the building’s water-based heating system. Pietrocola had considered using heat-pump boilers instead, which can be twice as efficient because they move heat instead of making it, but he nixed the idea because it would’ve meant replacing the hydronic system’s distribution pipes with bigger ones.
Building One now has electric-resistance boilers instead of ones that burn gas. (Port Authority of New York and New Jersey)
Workers also made some more staid updates to lower energy costs: weatherizing the building, applying heat-blocking films on the windows, and replacing more than 1,500 light fixtures with ultra-efficient LEDs.
In total, the project took 18 months and cost about $15 million — $3 million more than it would’ve had the Port Authority stuck with gas-fired equipment, according to Pietrocola.
The Port Authority didn’t use any incentives to cover the expenses, in part because the team needed to act quickly to replace the building’s worn-out systems. But [consumer credits](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/use-tax-credits-evs-home-before-gone) for heat pumps, EVs, and other clean energy tech, the 
Building One’s retrofit has slashed energy use by about 25%, Pietrocola said. Still, due to the area’s relatively high cost of electricity, he doesn’t expect the structure’s utility bills to fall.
Pietrocola plans to apply the lessons learned at Building One to other Port Authority structures as their fossil-fueled systems age out, he said. He’ll approach each project with a fresh eye to the building’s particular needs and the technology available. Next time, he added, the agency may go with hydronic heat pumps instead of the electric-resistance boilers.
Decarbonizing buildings “is a very important cause to me, personally and professionally,” Pietrocola noted. Recently, he worked with his 14-year-old daughter, Kayla, on a climate-change science project. “It made me realize, well, I’m part of the problem — the way I’ve operated facilities [in the past], perhaps with a closed mind.” After guiding the electrification of one of the country’s most storied structures, he feels like he’s become part of the solution.","Carbon-free buildings, Electrification, Energy efficiency, Northeast, New Jersey",port-authority-electrifies-historic-airport-terminal.md,articles_carbon-free-buildings

New York just took a big leap toward zero-emissions buildings.
On July 25, the State Fire Prevention and Building Code Council approved 2023 All-Electric Buildings Act.
“I’m excited that we are finally tackling, statewide, our largest source of fossil-fuel emissions,” said state Assemblymember Emily Gallagher, who sponsored the 2023 legislation. Buildings account for

The state’s rules will apply to new structures up to seven stories tall and, for commercial and industrial buildings, up to 100,000 square feet beginning Dec. 31, 2025. Buildings bigger than that will need to be built all-electric starting in 2029. The new code will spur installations of [heat pumps](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/a-beginners-guide-to-the-different-types-of-heat-pumps) and [heat-pump water heaters](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/heat-pump-water-heater-sales-home-electrification) — ultra-efficient electric appliances that are good for the planet and, 
The council left room for exceptions, though, including new laboratories, crematoriums, restaurants, and large buildings whose owners can prove the grid isn’t ready to accommodate their sizable all-electric heating needs. Michael Hernandez, a policy director at electrification advocacy nonprofit Rewiring America, said he doesn’t think the exemptions will eat away at the code’s efficacy, however.
With the rules finalized, “I’m relieved,” Gallagher told Canary Media. Fossil-fuel interests — such as “really worked overtime to try to stop this,” she said.
The new regulations come on the heels of a recent legal victory: On July 23, a federal district court in New York upheld the state’s ability to 
The groups challenging the law in court — including the New York State Builders Association, National Association of Home Builders, National Propane Gas Association, and a few local union chapters for plumbers and electricians — alleged that it’s preempted by the federal Energy Policy and Conservation Act, the same justification used to [overturn Berkeley, California’s pioneering ban](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/berkeleys-gas-ban-is-all-but-dead-what-does-that-mean-for-other-cities) on gas hookups in new construction. The New York judge was unconvinced by this argument, “deficient interpretations” of terms like “energy use,” and is “simply not persuasive.”
Opponents of the standard haven’t quit, though. An industry coalition that includes many of the organizations that brought the lawsuit sent a 26 to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi requesting that the Department of Justice move to block the code from taking effect. Michael Fazio, lead author of the letter and the executive director of the New York State Builders Association, declined to comment on the request’s status to Canary Media.
The state’s new energy code is expected to raise the cost of residential construction but also lower energy bills substantially for homeowners and renters, making it cost-effective overall with a payback of 10 years or less, according to a [report](https://assets.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Energy-Savings-and-Cost-Effectiveness-Residential-Provisions.pdf) commissioned by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. Over 30 years, households are expected to save an average of about $5,000 due to a 17% reduction in energy use.
Other research indicates all-electric construction is typically less expensive than that for buildings equipped to burn gas or fuel oil. Electric-only projects allow developers to forgo installing costly fossil-fuel infrastructure alongside the electrical systems requisite in modern buildings. A 2022 analysis by the decarbonization nonprofit New Buildings Institute, for example, found that building an all-electric single-family home in New York costs about 
The all-electric code will improve air quality by reducing reliance on fossil-fuel-fired boilers, furnaces, water heaters, and stoves. These conventional appliances spew harmful byproducts such as carbon monoxide, particulate matter, benzene, nitrogen oxides, and more, which can [cause respiratory and cardiovascular issues](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/just-how-bad-are-gas-appliances-for-your-health) — to lethal effect.

“Numerous studies … show that both air pollution and climate change WE ACT for Environmental Justice. The state’s all-electric building standard “is a significant step forward for environmental and climate justice.”
The new rules will not only get heat pumps into new construction but help boost adoption in existing homes, according to Jay Best, CEO of home energy-efficiency company Green Team Long Island.
“We’re always telling people about heat pumps … solutions that are going to save them money and make their homes more comfortable,” Best told Canary Media. “But people are apprehensive because it’s something they’re not used to,” despite [heat pump units outselling gas furnaces nationally](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/heat-pumps-keep-widening-their-lead-on-gas-furnaces).
“The code … sets a bar; this is the minimum that the state says is legal to build,” Best said. That “changes people’s view of the technology.”
Alex Beauchamp, Northeast region director at Food Water Watch, underscored that passing the All-Electric Buildings Act and getting it into the state code was a victory of David-and-Goliath proportions, with “fossil-fuel companies, plus the gas utilities, plus big real estate” rallied in opposition, he said.
“When New Yorkers come together … we can win even in the face of opponents with an almost-limitless budget,” he said. “That is how we won this bill. It’s also how we are going to continue the fight to get fossil fuels out of all the existing buildings in the state.”","Carbon-free buildings, Electrification, Emissions reduction, Policy regulation, Northeast, New York",new-york-finalizes-gas-ban.md,articles_carbon-free-buildings

The starting gun for the long-promised U.S. nuclear renaissance might have just gone off.
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 800-megawatt Palisades Nuclear Plant three years after the facility shut down. Although the project still needs to clear some federal hurdles, the NRC’s action signals its intention to give Holtec the full go-ahead.
If Holtec succeeds in bringing Palisades back online this year as promised, it would be the first nuclear plant in the U.S. to restart after being closed down. Remarkably, it would be just the second or third reactor to come back online in the global history of civilian nuclear power.
Holtec President Kelly Trice praised the NRC’s move in a “an unprecedented milestone in U.S. nuclear energy.” The company expects the plant to come back online before the end of the year — an extremely ambitious target given the uncharted regulatory territory of a reactor restart and the industry’s history of [construction delays](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear/georgias-big-new-nuclear-reactors-could-be-the-last-built-in-the-us).
Located on Lake Michigan and a two-hour drive from Chicago, the Palisades plant started producing electricity on New Year’s Eve 1971 and was 2022 by utility Entergy because of cost issues. It was America’s eighth-oldest nuclear plant at the time of its closing, with a troubled history of temporary shutdowns due to equipment failures. Although its performance improved in the later years of the plant’s operation, Palisades closed 11 days ahead of its scheduled shutdown because of a reliability issue.
Holtec — whose main lines of business are decommissioning reactors and managing nuclear waste — 2022. But just weeks into the decommissioning process, it made the surprise 
Despite that lack of experience, the relatively speedy NRC approval means that Holtec can now reinstall uranium fuel in the reactor as soon as August and begin the work of restarting the complex nuclear facility. About 600 full-time workers are currently employed at the plant.
Palisades is not the only shuttered reactor that’s [being considered for reopening](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear/palisades-three-mile-island-nuclear-restart) as part of the U.S. strategy to jump-start its flatlined nuclear industry. Last year, Microsoft 2028; it had been decommissioned in 2019 because of poor economics. Power provider NextEra Energy is also weighing reanimating Iowa’s only nuclear plant, the 50-year-old reactor at the 2020 because of storm damage and cost issues.
## **Social license — and a lot of subsidies**
Nuclear power has newfound social license in the U.S. Citizen support has 20 other countries, vowed to [triple nuclear power capacity](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear/20-plus-countries-pledge-to-triple-the-worlds-nuclear-energy-by-2050) by 2050 during the COP28 global climate conference in 2023.
Nuclear is now viewed by many as crucial to meeting the [soaring electricity demand](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/suddenly-us-electricity-demand-is-spiking-can-the-grid-keep-up) that’s being driven by an [AI-spurred data-center frenzy](https://www.canarymedia.com/boon-or-bane-what-will-data-centers-do-to-the-grid) along with the electrification of transportation and industry. Tech giants in particular are hungry for the clean, firm, 24/7 power that nuclear plants can provide, as their data centers crave round-the-clock electricity.
Aside from renaming post offices, bolstering nuclear power is the rare type of policy that can gain bipartisan agreement — the Biden administration initiated this atomic energy rally, and the Trump admin is maintaining its momentum.
Trump’s recent set of “energy dominance.”
So it’s a good time to be a nuclear plant operator. Notoriously expensive nuclear reactors can now claim a bundle of incentives and subsidies. Consider all the goodies Holtec will be able to take advantage of. 
  * Holtec received a $1.52 billion loan under the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment program of the Inflation Reduction Act, which backs projects that repower idled energy infrastructure. It was 
  * If Palisades produces power, Holtec will qualify for the production tax credit for nuclear that is placed in service in 2025 and after.
  * Also courtesy of the IRA, Holtec will benefit from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Empowering Rural America program, which [awarded](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/how-7-3b-will-help-rural-co-ops-build-clean-power-and-close-coal-plants) two rural electric cooperatives over $1.3 billion in grants to purchase power from Palisades — building demand for the reactor’s output and defraying the costs of nuclear power for co-op members.
  * Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) and Michigan legislators have approved 


## **Uncharted regulatory and reliability territory**
Not everyone is enthusiastic about the Palisades reactor restart.
Kevin Kamps of anti-nuclear organization Beyond Nuclear told Canary Media that the NRC is “under tremendous pressure” and “bowing to Holtec’s schedule” as it “pushes the envelope on risk.”
He wrote in a “The zombie reactor restart scheme is unneeded, insanely expensive for the public, and extremely high risk for health, safety, security, and the environment.”
The advocacy organization claims that Holtec “neglected critical safety maintenance from 2022 to 2024.” Beyond Nuclear is particularly worried about the impact of corrosion on a massive, expensive, and critical part of the reactor: the steam generator.
There are NRC proceedings that “the failure of a single tube would result in a release of radioactivity to the environment” and “a cascading failure of tubes could cause a reactor core meltdown and catastrophic release of hazardous radioactivity.”
Beyond Nuclear intends to appeal the NRC’s green light for restart once it’s finalized.
## **The way forward**
Unfortunately, restarting a few vintage plants would contribute little toward the broader goal of building hundreds of gigawatts of low-cost nuclear power. There just aren’t enough eligible decommissioned nuclear plants to make much of a difference.
Nuclear enthusiasts rave about the prospects for [small modular reactors](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear/small-modular-reactors-are-having-a-moment-will-any-get-built) and other advanced reactors, with their novel designs, coolants, and fuels. But while those technologies are engineering marvels, they won’t do anything to drive down costs in the next few years.
A more direct solution to growing the U.S. nuclear fleet (and keeping up with a surging China) would be to build tried and tested models of big, traditional nuclear plants over and over again. Venture capital-funded consortia such as [The Nuclear Co.](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear/the-us-nuclear-industry-is-stuck-can-this-startup-get-it-rolling-again) and other [Vogtle 3](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear/vogtle-3-nuclear-reactor-is-finally-seriously-for-real-online), which was years late and billions over budget.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems just raised $863 million in additional funding as the company works to achieve the [decades-old dream](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear/can-the-dream-of-fusion-power-be-realized) of commercializing nuclear fusion.
On Thursday, CFS said that, with its 3 billion in capital since it was spun out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2018. That’s just under one-third of the 
Seemingly every type of investor showed up for CFS’ latest funding round as the world’s interest in the long-promised, highly speculative technology continues to soar. Over three dozen names appear in the startup’s new announcement, including those of venture capitalists, sovereign wealth funds, private equity firms, individual investors, industrial firms, hedge funds, pension funds, and private banks.
CFS has ambitious plans to begin supplying one of its big-name investors — Google — with power in the next few years from a plant in Virginia.
“This funding recognizes CFS’ leadership role in developing a new technology that promises to be a reliable source of clean, almost limitless energy,” Bob Mumgaard, CEO and cofounder of CFS, said in an Aug. 28 press release. He said the company “will enable investors to have the opportunity to capitalize on the birth of a new global industry.”
To oversimplify, nuclear fusion — the source of the sun’s energy — involves converting hydrogen into plasma, which is then compressed and confined in a process that releases massive amounts of energy. Proponents say that fusion power plants could offer the best of nuclear energy — carbon-free electricity supplied around the clock — without the drawbacks of today’s nuclear fission plants, including the risk of catastrophic meltdowns and evergrowing stockpiles of radioactive waste.
Despite decades of research and billions of dollars in funding, fusion energy remains on the extremely early end of the technology-development curve. Yet a handful of recent engineering breakthroughs are giving fusion scientists and their deep-pocketed investors fresh hope that commercial fusion power could finally come to fruition.
Other startups such as Avalanche Energy, General Fusion, Helion Energy, TAE Technologies, Xcimer Energy, and Zap Energy have also [raised jaw-dropping funding rounds](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear/nuclear-fusion-the-ultimate-deep-tech-now-attracts-billions-in-private-funding) in recent years from billionaires and investment funds. The Fusion Industry Association lists more than 50 companies working in the field, which together raised $2.64 billion in private and public funding in the past year — nearly three times more than in the previous year.
This growing fleet of fusion startups is pursuing a variety of technologies, such as systems [using mighty laser beams](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear/nuclear-fusion-startup-xcimer-raises-100m-to-chase-laser-based-power) or extremely high voltages. CFS is taking a magnetic approach.

Will any get built?,21 July 2025,Maria Gallucci,"Nuclear experts say 74 SMR designs are under active development worldwide. Proponents see the tech as the key to nuclear energy’s future.

The nuclear energy industry is seeing [a resurgence](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear/nuclear-power-had-a-strong-year-in-2024-but-uncertainty-looms-for-2025) in global interest as governments, utilities, and tech giants seek to meet soaring electricity demand with around-the-clock, carbon-free power.
That’s true for not only conventional nuclear power plants but also a suite of alternative technologies known as “
Broadly defined, SMRs include designs ranging in capacity from 1 megawatt to several hundred megawatts. They encompass reactors using the same light-water technology that’s inside most existing nuclear plants, as well as projects with gas-cooled reactors or that use [emerging nuclear fuels](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear/the-us-may-soon-get-its-first-new-source-of-nuclear-fuel-in-70-years) like high-assay low-enriched uranium.
Seventy-four SMR designs are actively being developed worldwide, according to NEA), an intergovernmental agency within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Of that group, 51 designs are involved in pre-licensing or licensing activities with nuclear safety regulators in 15 countries — including the United States — marking a 65% increase in such efforts since 2023. The NEA said this growth reflects significant progress in bringing paper concepts closer to real-world projects, though only two commercial SMRs are actually operating today.
There’s “a real momentum behind this class of technologies,” William D. Magwood IV, the director-general of NEA, told reporters last week ahead of the July 22 launch of the agency’s updated SMR-tracking report.
At least $15 billion in public and private financing is now flowing into the SMR space, by the agency’s count. 
A screenshot of NEA's small modular reactor dashboard shows licensing progress of designs worldwide. (NEA)
The idea for small-scale reactors isn’t new: Nuclear scientists have been 1950s. Previous attempts to quickly and cheaply build smaller plants have failed, though nuclear advocates say the technology is finally ready to launch — as long as the industry can overcome the high technical and regulatory barriers that ensnared earlier generations.
“I’ve seen small reactors come and go over the years,” said Magwood. “The economics and other issues have always held them back. But what’s really different this time is that the need for [SMRs] is very clearly there.”
## **A growing list of hopeful SMR projects **
Proponents envision SMRs as a more nimble alternative to the giant power plants that currently provide 
Large-scale reactors can deliver gigawatts of baseload electricity, but they require a staggering amount of time and resources to build. In Georgia, Plant Vogtle’s 2.2 GW expansion took 15 years and cost 2024. The challenging economics — plus the complications of handling radioactive waste and the risk of 31 countries.
With SMRs, the thinking goes, relatively smaller plants can be plopped down wherever energy is needed in the world, with factory-fabricated components used to cut down on supply chain and construction costs. The designs being developed today aim to do everything from powering merchant ships and off-grid mining operations to supplying baseload power for data centers and producing high-temperature heat for manufacturing.
“SMR is not one thing — it’s a wide range of sizes, a wide range of temperatures,” said Diane Cameron, who leads NEA’s division of nuclear technology development and economics.
“This is both an opportunity and a challenge,” she said on the press call. “There’s a lot going on, and sometimes financiers or regulators and policymakers are wondering where to focus their efforts first.” That includes figuring out how to handle new types of nuclear-fuel waste streams from cutting-edge SMR designs, in addition to the mounting waste from conventional reactors.

So far, however, SMRs have yet to reach their potential.
Cameron noted that the only commercial reactors generating electricity today include 210 MW steam turbine — and a 70 MW CAREM-25 reactor has been under construction for over a decade, though work 
In the U.S., the startup NuScale Power is the only SMR developer to have its 77 MW unit in Idaho [fell apart in late 2023](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear/future-of-small-reactors-at-stake-as-nuscale-deal-flops) after NuScale nearly doubled its cost estimates because of high interest rates and inflation.
But a handful of other first-of-a-kind projects in North America have received key approvals to start laying the early groundwork.
In Ontario, Canada, regulators recently gave Ontario Power Generation the SMR project at the Darlington nuclear site. The project will use the light-water GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy — a design that stretches the meaning of the word “small.” A single reactor building will reach an estimated 220 feet above ground and nearly 112 feet below grade.
The BWRX-300 units will each be capable of generating 300 MW, or enough to power about 300,000 homes, with the first unit expected to be in service by the end of 2030. The total 1.2 GW Darlington project could cost around

In May, the Tennessee Valley Authority became the BWRX-300 — with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which accepted the application on July 10. After regulatory approval, which is expected by the end of 2026, the TVA plans to install the design at its Clinch River site near Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and to commission the plant by 2032.
The startup Kairos Power is also developing an SMR project in Oak Ridge, but at a much smaller scale and with a less conventional design: a molten fluoride salt coolant and a higher-concentration uranium fuel recipe.
The company aims to start operating a 35 MW thermal Hermes reactor as early as 2026, with a commercial version to be deployed in the 2030s. On July 16, the company said it had DOE) has agreed to provide 629 million project through its Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program.

Meanwhile, in Wyoming, Bill Gates’ startup TerraPower 345 MW reactor near a retiring coal plant in Kemmerer. The company’s Natrium reactor, which it aims to bring online in 2030, is a sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten-salt-based storage system and is expected to cost up to $4 billion to complete — with the DOE slated to cover half of that tab through the demonstration program.
The DOE launched the program in 2020, during the first Trump administration. Trump’s second administration is now doubling down on federal support for nuclear projects even as it [slashes crucial incentives](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/wind-solar-construction-trump-tax-credits) for other carbon-free power sources like wind and solar.
The administration wants to quadruple U.S. nuclear energy capacity from 100 GW to 400 GW by 2050. To get there, it has “rubber stamp” new reactor designs. Earlier this month, the NRC 31, 2025.
“There’s tremendous activity here in the United States directed towards deploying all forms of new nuclear” to meet growing electricity demand, John Kotek, senior vice president of policy and public affairs at the Nuclear Energy Institute, a U.S. trade association, said on the press call.
With the emergence of next-generation tech from Kairos and TerraPower, he said, “it’s really much more like Silicon Valley than the traditional nuclear industry here in the U.S.”",Nuclear,small-modular-reactors-are-having-a-moment-will-any-get-built.md,articles_nuclear
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/chicago-ev-ambassador-comed,Can EV ambassadors help Chicago drivers go electric?,5 August 2025,Kari Lydersen,"Aiming to help Illinois get 1 million EVs on the road by 2030, the state’s largest utility is tapping community leaders to convince neighbors to ditch gas cars.

Illinois has big plans for electric vehicles — but they won’t happen unless residents of its biggest city, Chicago, embrace the battery-powered cars. That’s where EV ambassadors like William Davis come in.
Davis is one of a handful of community leaders working with utility ComEd under a new program that’s meant to convince skeptical individuals and businesses to electrify, and to connect them with incentives to do so.
“People don’t understand how EVs work, how they make their lives better,” he said, or “from a socioeconomic standpoint, why it’s urgent to accelerate this transition from internal combustion engines to EVs.”
ComEd, Illinois’ largest utility, sees ambassadors as a way to help fulfill the goals enshrined in its Beneficial Electrification plan, which is meant to drive EV adoption in the company’s territory and was mandated by 2030. There are now 150,000 registered in Illinois, and about 130,000 of those are in ComEd service territory — up from a 2010, according to the utility.
The Illinois Commerce Commission recently approved ComEd’s Beneficial Electrification plan for 2026 through 2028, which calls on the utility to spend $168 million promoting EVs. Most of the funding will go toward rebates for EVs and chargers for residents, businesses, and public use. That will bring ComEd’s total spending on the program to $400 million between 2023 and 2028.
Already, ComEd has offered rebates for about 5,800 charging ports and over 1,500 electric vehicles, said Cristina Botero, senior manager of the company’s Beneficial Electrification program.
More than 1,400 of those vehicles and almost half of the charging ports are in areas that qualify for social-equity incentives under state law. Botero said that in all, 80% of Beneficial Electrification EV incentives have gone to places the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act designates as “
The ambassador program, launched this summer, aims to deepen the plan’s benefits to these areas, which also stand to gain the most from EVs, given the high levels of vehicle pollution they face. The initiative is rolling out first in historically marginalized South Side neighborhoods like Bronzeville, where Davis is executive director of the 
Davis is approaching the ambassadorship from experience. His organization is in the process of installing two EV chargers thanks to ComEd incentives, and it recently [purchased an electric van](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/chicago-community-group-advances-evs-despite-federal-setbacks) through a city climate grant. He imagines the van serving as a modern jitney — referencing the informal cabs that once plied the streets of Bronzeville and other segregated neighborhoods, transporting Black customers that taxi drivers refused to serve.

Nicole Wheatly is another EV ambassador. She’s the founder and executive director of 
Wheatly recently bought her own EV — a Hummer — and has noticed that it’s cheaper to run than her previous gasoline-fueled car. She received a ComEd rebate for a charger that she is in the process of installing at her home.
In her view, spreading information through existing connections is more important than ever. When she’s on the clock as a real-estate agent, she already encourages clients to consider homes with electric rather than gas heat.
“I’m in community development. In the past we could knock on doors and people would answer, but people are not trusting anymore,” Wheatly said. “I’m getting the word out through that personal touch, personal relationships, personal email contacts for people I know will be open to hear these things.”
For Remel Terry, another ambassador, it’s especially crucial to draw the connection between the benefits of EVs and the transportation-related challenges the community has historically faced.
“Most of our communities are significantly impacted by all of the environmental justice concerns,” said Terry, director of programs for 
“We’re helping people to see the benefit of getting rid of gas cars, transitioning to electric cars for a significant benefit,” she continued. “Not just the environmental aspect, but the cost over time.”
Both Equiticity and the Bronzeville Community Development Partnership are pushing to expand charging infrastructure in underserved neighborhoods, especially for apartment-dwellers or others who would have trouble installing a charger at their home.
Davis said the COVID-19 pandemic really drove home the toll of air pollution on his community, as many residents have respiratory illnesses that make them even more susceptible to the disease.
“Transportation is fouling the air,” said Davis. “How do we solve that? There are steps we can take to create a cleaner transportation environment. An essential piece is electric vehicle transportation.”","Electric vehicles, EV charging, Utilities, Midwest, Illinois",chicago-ev-ambassador-comed.md,articles_electric-vehicles
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/ill-drive-what-shes-driving-this-campaign-wants-more-women-to-try-evs,‘I’ll drive what she’s driving’: This campaign wants more women to try EVs,27 May 2025,Elizabeth Ouzts,"Women make up less than 30% of EV owners. A Virginia-based nonprofit aims to boost that number. 
Brooke Canova (left) is one of roughly 7,000 “EV ambassadors” recruited by nonprofit Generation180 to spread the word about their experiences driving electric vehicles. (Generation180)
Brooke Canova was nervous after she and her husband bought their Ford F-150 Lightning, the electric version of the enormous, classic pickup truck.
She wasn’t worried about running out of charge and being stranded on the road, or whether the truck would have enough oomph to merge onto a speeding highway. Canova, a health and physical education teacher and mother of a preteen son in Charlottesville, Virginia, fretted about the vehicle’s size.
“I’m not going to be able to drive this!” she recalled thinking. “It’s too big. How will I park it?”
The purchase was a sort of compromise: Her husband had long wanted a truck, and she finally agreed to go along if it was electric.
As it turns out, the vehicle has enough cameras to help Canova manage its girth. It can parallel park itself in self-driving mode. What’s more, she can drive to Richmond, Virginia, and back on one 320-mile charge. And since her rooftop is equipped with 27 solar panels, it costs her family less than $6 a month to charge the truck at home.
“It has been a lot of fun,” Canova said, especially as a woman driving a big truck that’s electric to boot. “It’s sort of a conversation piece. People are like, ‘Wow, look at you in that thing!’”
That’s just the reaction Generation180 is hoping to provoke. Headquartered in Charlottesville, the nonprofit has recruited Canova and some 7,000 other “EV ambassadors” nationwide to spread the word about their experiences online and in person.
While the group supports policies to speed the clean energy transition, its core mission is to “inspire and equip” people to adopt clean energy in their own lives, said Executive Director Stuart Gardner. EV ownership, he said, is a vital “stepping stone” to other clean energy actions.
Gardner’s team has long encouraged people to drive electric. But last year, their research found remarkable gender disparities among the “EV curious” in Virginia. Women said helping the environment was a top reason to drive electric, tied with saving money. Yet just a quarter of women had heard “a lot” about EVs, compared to nearly half of men.
The Virginia survey was backed up by other studies, which showed just 30% of women had some familiarity with EVs, compared to over half of men. In all, 
“There was an obvious disconnect, Gardner said. The “
The initiative is focused on reaching women in the suburbs — auto-dependent areas where electric vehicles are ideal for short trips and where many new-car buyers live, said Gardner. Suburbs also “tend to be evenly split Democrat and Republican,” he said, “So, they [offer] a great opportunity to say, ‘Hey, EVs are for everyone.’”
At the crux of the effort is the belief that people in general and women in particular are skeptical of the increasingly polarized information landscape and are looking for reliable messengers.
The women EV owners Generation180 has identified did a lot of research first, said Shakaya Cooper, program manager with the group. Much of that homework involved talking to friends and colleagues, she said. “They’re intentional in their research, and they are going to people that are trusted sources, for sure.”
## **How EV perks — like “frunks” — can win over consumers**
That’s where volunteer ambassadors like Canova come in. Last fall, she brought her F-150 Lightning to a car show tied to a downtown Charlottesville event, where various EV makes and models were on display. A graduate of the University of Virginia, she’s also attended college basketball games with a suite of other women to talk about going electric.
“It was just a really nice vibe — talking to people about their cars, what they like, what they don’t like,” she said, having “those really approachable conversations between moms.” 
Beyond official functions organized by Generation180, Canova and her family undoubtedly pique EV curiosity in their community by milking all the Lightning’s bells and whistles in their daily lives.
One popular feature is the “frunk,” a trunk in the front where a combustion engine would normally go. With a drainage hole and light insulation, it can act as a cooler. Plus, the entire vehicle is equipped with outlets — making it perfect for tailgating.
“One of our favorite things to do with the truck is tailgate because we plug in an [electric] pellet grill and a griddle and a TV — all into the truck bed, which has been a lot of fun,” she said. “We tailgated for a Little League game the other day; the whole team was there.”

After a year with the Lightning, Canova and her husband were so sold on driving electric that when her treasured Ford Escape perished last summer, she replaced it with a used Tesla. “We haven’t really encountered any moments where we’ve been desperate to have a gas vehicle,” she said. “We’re all in.”
Some 340 miles south of Charlottesville in Bostic, a tiny town in the North Carolina foothills between Charlotte and Asheville, Terri Watts and her husband are equally thrilled with their EV but for very different reasons.
As the owners of a high-end chauffeur service, they use their fleet of 17 premium vehicles to transport customers to wine and beer tours, weddings, and scenic vistas in this tourist-heavy corner of the state. One of their most popular rides is a Rivian, especially among clients who have their own EV at home and are committed to a low-carbon lifestyle.
“It’s another offering that fits what some people are looking for,” said Watts, who is also a Generation180 EV ambassador. “I think it allows us to maybe get more business. There are people who, unless [they can get] an electric vehicle, they’re not interested.”
Terri Watts and the Rivian that she and her husband use for their chauffeur service business in Bostic, North Carolina. (Terri Watts)
From a financial perspective, the Rivian is a no-brainer. The couple paid tens of thousands of dollars less for it than their other luxury vans, and its operating costs are much lower. There are no oil changes, and they can fully charge it overnight at their house for $15. If a driver needs to use a public fast charger, the price might run as high as $45. By contrast, filling up one of their conventional SUVs with premium fuel runs between $55 and $75.
The Rivian’s style and performance has also won converts. “It’s really nice. It’s very roomy on the inside,” Watts said. “It’s got the speed that you can’t beat.”
One recent weekend, she added, a pair of women had wanted a sedan for their sightseeing tour, but it was booked. They rented the Rivian instead and enjoyed it so much they reserved it again for the next day of their trip. “They were super impressed,” Watts said.
## **The factors still holding back EV adoption**
In addition to having person-to-person conversations about their EVs, scores of women including Watts and Canova have blogged about their experiences for Generation180. The group has also identified social media influencers who’ve rented EVs and posted about activities ranging from the novel to the mundane, like charging at the shopping center while buying groceries.
“The individuals have been moms, families, single women,” Cooper said, “just sharing, ‘I could go hiking in the rural part of North Carolina or in a rural part of Virginia and still be able to charge.’”
Cooper and other advocates acknowledge that long road trips in EVs still require more planning than those in conventional gas-powered vehicles. And the price of entry to drive electric, while falling, is still too high for many.
Lawmakers in both Richmond and Washington, D.C., have sought in recent years to alleviate these barriers to EV adoption. Biden-era tax credits for new and used electric vehicles lower upfront costs. A nationwide commitment to charging infrastructure, especially in rural areas, is critical for peace of mind on long road trips.
In Virginia, state lawmakers created an electric vehicle rebate program four years ago but have yet to fund it. In a move most observers say is illegal, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin last year announced 
At the federal level, the Trump administration has [frozen billions of dollars](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/trump-moves-to-halt-5b-ev-charging-program) for states to build charging stations, also likely in violation of the law. Just before the Memorial Day weekend, House Republicans muscled through a massive tax bill that, in addition to [dealing other blows to clean energy](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/republican-tax-bill-credits-china), would end the electric vehicle tax credits and 
“It’s really unfortunate. It really hurts the more rapid adoption of electric vehicles,” said Gardner, who says the credits and rebates should be preserved. But, he added, the turbulence in Washington reinforces the value of his group’s “I’ll Drive What She’s Driving” campaign.
“We’re seeing now that policy can be very fragile,” he said. “But trusted messengers and the clean energy constituencies that we’re building — those have real staying power.”

Takemura,"Trump’s megabill ends the consumer tax credits for EVs in September. But until then, shoppers can still use them to lock in lower prices — and great lease deals. 
Could this be hot EV summer? (Chevrolet; Binh Nguyen/Canary Media)
_Canary Media’s “_[ _Electrified Life_](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/columns/electrified-life) _” column shares real-world tales, tips, and insights to demystify what individuals can do to shift their homes and lives to clean electric power._ Have you been thinking about getting an electric vehicle? It may be time to put your foot on the accelerator.
On July 4, President Donald Trump [signed the “Big, Beautiful Bill”](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/trump-big-beautiful-bill-industry-impacts) — and thus hastened the expiration date for tax credits that knock thousands of dollars off the price of an EV.
Under former President Joe Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act, these incentives would have lasted another seven years. They’ll now sunset in just a few months, on Sept. 30. 
That leaves a small window of opportunity for shoppers willing to move fast.
“There are just so many benefits to driving an EV, and we encourage people to take advantage of the tax credits while they’re here,” said Ingrid Malmgren, senior policy director at the nonprofit EV advocacy organization Plug In America.
Getting an EV is one of the best ways to reduce your planet-warming pollution — [on par with](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/yes-heat-pumps-slash-emissions-even-if-powered-by-a-dirty-grid) or [heat pump](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/a-beginners-guide-to-the-different-types-of-heat-pumps). And though they tend to cost more up front than cars that guzzle gasoline, EVs have many advantages. For starters, they provide a [smoother, quieter driving experience](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/go-ahead-rent-that-ev-just-make-a-charging-plan-before-setting-out). They also eliminate trips to the gas station and cost less to operate and maintain, pointed out Sara Baldwin, senior director of the electrification policy team at think tank Energy Innovation. A 2023 analysis by the nonpartisan group found that in every state, 
Here’s a rundown of the incentives that are available until the end of September:
**The** 7,500 off your federal tax bill for a brand-new, qualifying EV model that meets strict requirements around where it’s assembled and where the battery bits come from, for example. 300,000 for married couples filing jointly, or $150,000 for single filers. You can get the discount right when you make your purchase.
**The** 4,000 off your federal tax bill for : $150,000 for married couples filing jointly and $75,000 for single filers. You can get the discount at the point of sale.
**The** 7,500 can’t be claimed by consumers, but it benefits them anyway. Auto dealers can take the federal tax credit themselves, passing on the savings to leasing customers. Also affectionately dubbed the EV “.
Plus, there’s one more relevant credit that has a slightly longer lead time:
**The** 1,000 off your federal tax bill to install qualified EV charging equipment if you live in an eligible area. This credit doesn’t expire until June 30, 2026.
## **What losing the tax credits means for the U.S. EV market**
“The tax credits have been really powerful at helping to drive EV adoption and to make EVs more accessible to lower- and moderate-income families,” Malmgren said.
Once they’re gone, experts are expecting the growth of the EV market to slow — but not stop — under the Trump administration.
The loss of the tax credits is compounded by other headwinds from the federal government, which has [frozen funding](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/trump-moves-to-halt-5b-ev-charging-program) to build out a network of EV chargers, and 2030, down from last year’s prediction of 48%. Now, the research firm expects EV sales to fall even lower.
For the next two-and-a-half months that the federal incentives are intact, automakers and dealers could drop prices to try to move their inventory more aggressively, said Loren McDonald, chief analyst at EV and charging data firm Paren.
Fueled by the tax credits, the EV market has already had a steady drumbeat of some “amazingly low lease prices,” Malmgren noted. For example, in July, the 2024 Fiat 500e and the 2025 Toyota bZ4X, an all-electric SUV, are both on offer for $179 per month, 
Customers could see more deals like these if sellers anticipate a slump in consumer interest once the tax credits expire. However, discount offers are likely to be patchy, with the most popular models maintaining higher price points if demand for them outstrips supply, McDonald said.
In the used-EV sector, the $4,000 credit can make an especially big difference; some used EVs are priced as low as $15,000 or $20,000 to begin with.
“The used EV market is quietly on fire,” said Liz Najman, director of market insights at Recurrent, a company that aggregates data on [battery health](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/batteries/the-used-ev-market-cant-thrive-without-accurate-battery-health-data) from tens of thousands of EVs across the United States.

It has been in the works for more than a decade, and construction on its first phase was slated to start next year.
While the Grain Belt Express had support from utility regulators and large electricity consumers along the line’s route, Missouri Republicans turned against it in recent weeks. The state’s Republican attorney general launched an investigation into the project earlier this month, and Sen. Josh Hawley said he made a direct appeal to President Trump to pull back federal support.
**Can the EPA revoke all its emissions rules at once?**
The U.S. EPA is planning to demolish the bedrock of many of its climate change-fighting regulations, 2009 “endangerment finding,” which scientifically established that greenhouse gases harm human health. That finding underpins many of the EPA’s landmark emissions rules, including regulations targeting pollution from cars, factories, and power plants. If the finding is revoked, it would immediately end all those limits and make it harder for future presidential administrations to reinstate them.
The draft of the rule change doesn’t dispute that climate pollutants like carbon dioxide and methane drive global warming or put people’s health at risk, according to the Times. Instead, it claims the endangerment finding oversteps the EPA’s authority. The new rule is almost certain to face legal challenges if it’s finalized.

But experts warn there are no easy fixes.

The country’s biggest power market is caught in a trap of its own making — and the more than 65 million people from the mid-Atlantic coast to the Great Lakes who rely on it for electricity will pay the price.
Last week, PJM Interconnection announced a new record in its 13 states and Washington, D.C. Prices increased to $16.1 billion, up from last year’s already [record-setting $14.7 billion](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/prices-just-spiked-in-the-biggest-us-power-market-blame-the-grid-backlog) and an eightfold increase compared to $2.2 billion for the 2023 auction.
Prices would have spiked even further PJM estimates that residential customers could see utility bills rise by up to 5% in the years to come, or more than $100 in annual household costs — rate hikes that will occur on top of bill increases 
These spiraling costs have galvanized both Republican and Democratic governors of states served by PJM to “With billions of ratepayer dollars and the stability of our grid at stake, it is critical that PJM take concerted, effective action to restore state and stakeholder confidence,” governors from Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia wrote in a July 
But it’s unclear whether PJM can quickly solve the problems that are driving up costs. That’s because the core issue — barely any new generation capacity has been able to connect to the grid — will take years to resolve.
“You have a massive technical problem, which is the challenge to fix this broken interconnection queue and bring new resources online in a time of global uncertainty with tariffs, inflation, and supply chain issues that are slowing the construction and development of new generation resources,” Jon Gordon, a director at clean-energy trade group Advanced Energy United, said in a webinar last week dissecting the grid operator’s current predicament.
PJM isn’t the [only U.S. regional grid operator struggling](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/the-growing-clean-energy-backlog-in-five-charts) to get new power plants, solar and wind farms, and grid-scale batteries connected. But it has one of the worst track records, with projects taking an average of PJM a D- score for its interconnection processes in a 
The consequence has been a paltry amount of new generation and battery storage. PJM reported last week that about 2.7 gigawatts of new generation and “uprates” — existing projects that have augmented their capacity — had been added to its available pool of resources since its last auction. That’s the first such increase in the past four auctions, and a fraction of PJM’s roughly 
Nor is PJM winning high marks for its efforts to fix its interconnection backlog. Critics say the [grid operator has stalled on reforms](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/a-backed-up-grid-threatens-clean-energy-growth-from-virginia-to-illinois) that others have undertaken, including changes mandated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Last week, FERC “conceptual proposals” that it said fail to meet federally mandated deadlines for [implementing interconnection reforms](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/ferc-takes-a-big-step-to-get-more-clean-energy-on-the-us-grid).
In 2022, PJM 2010s. That backlog won’t be cleared until the end of 2026, leaving hundreds of gigawatts of prospective new supply in limbo.
“The market can’t work until the interconnection queue delay is fixed,” Clara Summers, campaign manager for the Citizens Utility Board, an Illinois-based utility customer watchdog group, said during last week’s webinar. An PJM could save customers an average of $505 per year in utility bills and cut commercial and industrial electricity costs by 23% through 2040.
PJM noted in last week’s press release that it has processed more than 60% of the backlog in its interconnection queue. It also highlighted that more than 46 GW of “already-approved resources have yet to be built,” with many projects “navigating challenges outside PJM’s scope, such as permitting timelines, supply chain constraints and evolving project economics.”
Gordon pointed out that PJM’s interconnection bottlenecks have put energy developers in a very tough position. Nearly 95% of the grid operator’s backlog consists of solar, wind, and battery projects, and “many of those projects came into the queue pre-COVID,” he said.
Since then, interest rates have gone up dramatically, equipment costs have risen, and the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have [undone federal incentives](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/tax-credit-changes-trump-law) and policies supporting clean energy growth. “Whatever those developers were thinking about those projects back then, the economics, everything has completely changed,” he said.
## **Booming demand makes matters worse**
The forecasted demand for electricity on PJM’s grid has also increased enormously in the past four years. The AI bubble has driven up PJM’s projected load growth by 5.5 GW from last year’s auction, largely due to new plans for data centers in the region.
But PJM may not be applying the proper amount of skepticism to calculating future demand growth from data centers, said Abe Silverman, an attorney, energy consultant, and research scholar at Johns Hopkins University.
Many data center developers are [seeking interconnection in multiple states](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/utilities-are-flying-blind-on-data-center-demand-thats-a-big-problem) for duplicative project proposals, he noted. Other U.S. grid operators are “doing a much better job trying to get a handle on the data center load growth,” including winnowing out speculative or duplicative requests, he said during last week’s webinar.
Without such safeguards, PJM runs the risk of overestimating the amount of new generation it will need to meet future demand, which will drive up prices, Silverman said. “If you believe the PJM load forecast, we need to add five nuclear units’ worth of generation to the market every year between now and 2030. And that’s just an enormous challenge, both financially and logistically.”
In the face of these issues, PJM has largely emphasized the need to [keep fossil-fueled power plants online](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/coal-grid-reliability-trump) and has blamed state clean-energy policies for driving coal-fired power plants to close prematurely.
That argument has been echoed by Todd Snitchler, CEO and president of the Electric Power Supply Association, a trade group representing power plant operators with a preponderance of fossil-gas power plants in their portfolios.
“In recent years, a combination of state and federal policy shifts and poor market signals led to the premature retirement of essential generation,” Snitchler said in a “Now, as demand grows and supply tightens, we can’t ignore the consequences of past decisions, and we must accept that reliability comes at a cost.”
About 34 GW of coal capacity have retired across PJM since 2013, according to PJM’s 2030.
But Citizens Utility Board has emphasized that those retirements are happening in both Republican-led states without clean-energy and climate mandates, including Ohio and West Virginia, as well as in Democrat-led states such as Maryland and New Jersey, indicating that state policies aren’t the chief driver. The main reason coal plants are closing is that they are increasingly [unable to compete in energy markets](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/coal-grid-reliability-trump) against cheaper gas-fired power plants, renewable energy, and batteries.
Growing power demand is starting to slow the pace of closures. PJM noted last week that 1.1 GW of power plants have withdrawn their retirement plans since last year’s auction. PJM has also forced fossil-fueled power plants in Maryland that were set to close this year to [remain open to maintain grid reliability](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/zombie-coal-plants-could-threaten-the-us-energy-transition).
The Trump administration may cite PJM’s growing capacity problems to justify using emergency federal powers to require aging fossil-fueled power plants to remain running. The Department of Energy has already used those powers to demand that a coal plant in Michigan stay open, as well as an oil- and gas-fired power plant in Pennsylvania — a move that PJM has[climate and consumer advocates are challenging](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/trump-coal-plant-order-challenges).
At the same time, PJM has yet to advance near-term options for [bringing power online quickly](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/how-pjm-can-get-the-power-that-it-needs-and-fast), Summers said. PJM’s proposal to FERC approval, she said.
In February, PJM’s plans to revamp another process known as “surplus interconnection service,” which allows existing projects to [add new technologies to boost their grid value](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/why-wont-pjm-let-batteries-and-clean-power-bolster-a-stressed-out-grid) — for example, adding batteries to wind and solar farms. But the changes have not yet led to new capacity being brought into the market, Summers said.
Meanwhile, PJM’s attempt to fast-track new gas-fired generation won’t help in the near term, Summers said. In May, the grid operator 9.4 GW of capacity secured through that process — and all of the newly built gas-fired power plant capacity — isn’t scheduled to be online until 2030 or later.
That’s not surprising. Major manufacturers 
Accelerating resources that can actually be built in the next two years — like solar and batteries — would be a better strategy to reduce costs, Silverman said.
“Prices are increasing right now because we don’t have enough supply,” he said. “We really have choked off that next generation of projects that should be coming in and taking those positions in the market.”","Energy markets, Clean energy",pjm-rising-costs-interconnection-reform.md,articles_energy-markets
https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-markets/california-expand-regional-trading-west,New California law could expand energy trading across the West,23 September 2025,Jeff St. John,"Backers of a Western trading market say it could save billions and boost renewables. After years of delays, California is moving forward with the idea. 
After years of failed attempts, California lawmakers have cleared the way to create an electricity-trading market that would stretch across the U.S. West. Advocates say that could cut the region’s power costs by billions of dollars and support the growth of renewable energy. But opponents say it may make the state’s climate and clean-energy policies vulnerable to the Trump administration.
Those are the fault lines over “Pathways Initiative” bill, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sept. 19 as part of a major climate-and-energy legislative package. The law will grant the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), which runs the transmission grid and energy markets in most of the state, the authority to collaborate with other states and utilities across the West to [create a shared day-ahead energy-trading regime](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/a-western-us-energy-market-would-boost-clean-energy.-will-it-happen).
Passage of this bill won’t create that market overnight — that will take years of negotiations. CAISO’s board wouldn’t even be allowed to vote on creating the market until 2028.
But for advocates who’ve been working for more than a decade on plans for a West-wide regional energy market, it’s a momentous advance. “We’ve shot the starting gun,” said Brian Turner, a director at clean-energy trade group Advanced Energy United, which was outspoken in support of the legislation.
Today, utilities across the Western U.S. trade energy via bilateral arrangements — a clunky and inefficient way to take advantage of cheaper or cleaner power available across an interconnected transmission grid. An integrated day-ahead trading regime could drive major savings for all participants — nearly $1.2 billion per year, according to a 2022 CAISO.
That integrated market could create opportunities for solar power from California and the Southwest and wind power from the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest to be shared more efficiently, driving down energy costs and increasing reliability during extreme weather.
Lower-cost power more readily deliverable to where it’s needed could also reduce consumers’ monthly utility bills — a welcome prospect at a time of [soaring electricity rates](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/why-power-bills-are-rising).
The regional energy market plan is 
Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, a Democrat who authored AB 825, said in a statement following its passage that it “will protect California’s energy independence while opening the door to new opportunities to build and share renewable power across the West.”
But consumer advocates, including The Utility Reform Network, Consumer Watchdog, and Public Citizen, say the bill as passed 
## **What a Western energy market could achieve**
The arguments for a day-ahead energy-trading market can be boiled down to a simple concept, Turner said — bigger is better. Being able to obtain power from across the region could reduce the amount of generation capacity that individual utilities have to build. And tapping into energy supplies spanning from the Pacific Ocean to the Rocky Mountains would allow states undergoing heat waves and winter storms to draw on power from parts of the region that aren’t under the same grid stress, improving [resiliency against extreme weather](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/transmission/one-path-to-more-power-lines-make-us-grid-operators-share-more).
A Western trading market could also serve as a starting point for even more integrated activity between the dozens of utilities in the region that now plan and build power plants and transmission grids in an uncoordinated way. A 2 billion in annual energy savings, enable up to 4.4 gigawatts of additional clean power, and create hundreds of thousands of permanent jobs.
CAISO proposed this EDAM) concept CAISO’s EDAM scheme is competing with 14 Midwest and Great Plains states.
For advocates of a Western market, the chief challenge has been to design a structure that doesn’t give up California’s control over its own energy and climate policies, but allows other states and their utilities a share of decision-making authority over how the market works. Taking a lead on that design work has been the 
Regional-market boosters 2017 and 2018 in the face of opposition from environmental groups that feared the plan would clear the way for coal-fired power to come in from other states. Labor unions representing California utility workers also opposed those earlier bills on the grounds that cheaper out-of-state power could lead to less clean energy being built in California.
But many of these prior opponents, including the 
With the passage of AB 825, “we’re looking at a fairly rapid and clear rollout of the organization, so that Western states and utilities can begin to get engaged,” Turner said.
## **What are the risks?**
But by engaging in a regional energy market, California could risk losing some control over its climate and clean-energy progress, critics say. They argue that the final version of AB 825 doesn’t have enough protections against this outcome.
“We’re strongly opposed,” said Matthew Freedman, staff attorney at The Utility Reform Network (TURN). Previous versions of the bill “had a bunch of provisions we thought would have protected California’s sovereignty and prevented the federal government from weaponizing its authority. Most of those protections were stripped from the bill, inexplicably.”
In particular, in May, TURN and its allies pushed to 
“It’s about retaining the state’s sovereignty,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. “This is our last political check on when we get into the market and when we get out of the market.”
But the provisions in that amendment were “poison pills” for other states considering membership in the market, said Merrian Borgeson, California policy director for climate and energy for NRDC, which supported the legislation. “That would have made it far too unstable.”
The final version of AB 825 still gives California lawmakers the authority to pull the state out of the regional day-ahead market, said Turner of Advanced Energy United — just not via the hair-trigger structure that opponents had sought. “At any time, the Legislature could say, ‘This market is no longer in the interest of California. We’re going to order the Public Utilities Commission to order the utilities to stop participating in this market,’” he said.
The bill’s authors argue that they got the balance right. State Sen. Josh Becker, a Democrat whose bill initially contained the Pathways proposal before it was shifted into AB 825, said that the final structure “provides the accountability that some folks wanted but that’s also enticing to market participants.”However, TURN and Consumer Watchdog say that the risks outweigh the benefits — particularly if an expanded market exposes the state to federal interference. The Trump administration has been using federal emergency powers to [prevent regional grid operators from closing coal plants](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/forcing-dirty-power-plants-to-stay-open-would-cost-americans-billions) set for retirement, and it may seek to force the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to abandon its historically apolitical approach to governing regional energy markets, which could “frustrate key state environmental, resource-planning, reliability, or other public-interest policies,” Freedman said.
“Why California should give up its governance over that regional market is a mystery to me,” he said. “We have no faith that federal agencies will act with good faith or common sense or the law.”
Turner at Advanced Energy United disagrees with that assessment. “CAISO is currently a FERC-regulated market, and this will not increase its exposure to FERC regulation,” he said.
In the end, AB 825 won the support of what Becker “broad and unprecedented coalition spanning environmental organizations, labor, business, and consumer advocates.”
In fact, joining with other states might actually strengthen California’s position against Trump administration overreach, Turner argued. “We understand the federal government may try to distort the free market in ways that benefit their preferred technologies,” he said. “There is a very credible argument to be made that joining shoulder to shoulder with other states improves our ability to defend ourselves against those kinds of things.”","Energy markets, Clean energy, Policy regulation, West, California",california-expand-regional-trading-west.md,articles_energy-markets

The American [solar manufacturing renaissance](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-manufacturing/the-us-clean-energy-manufacturing-revolution-is-real) was charging ahead. Then President Donald Trump took the reins.
Since Trump resumed occupancy of the White House, promising to bring back manufacturing jobs, new investment in clean energy factories has plummeted from its Biden-era highs, and [factory cancellations have surged instead](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-manufacturing/trump-ev-battery-factory-cancellations). Now, with Trump’s signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this month, things are about to get even rockier for clean energy manufacturers — but several of the leading firms reshoring solar panel production still see reasons for qualified hope.
That’s not to say the path ahead will be easy. The law swings a battle-axe through the clean energy incentives that were carefully crafted by Democrats in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Solar and wind deployment credits will [disappear after 2027](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/tax-credit-changes-trump-law). Now, the U.S. will install somewhere between 2025 to 2035, per a new analysis by Rhodium Group. That’s bad for all the customers and industries who will [need vastly more electricity over that timeframe](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/data-centers-are-overwhelming-the-grid-could-they-help-it-instead) — not to mention the climate — but it also portends a shrinking market for American manufacturers to sell into.
“It’s a massive self-inflicted wound,” said Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), an architect of the original clean energy manufacturing policy. “This law is a targeted attack on the advanced energy industry. It will hamstring industrial development; it will undermine energy independence and drive up energy costs by interrupting the development and installation of new generation capacity.”
But for manufacturers who have kickstarted a stunning reshoring of the solar supply chain after years of decline, the legislation’s final form is not nearly as dire as some earlier drafts. Chiefly, Republicans preserved the flagship manufacturing credit, which pays a company for each unit they make of key clean-energy components.
“Because manufacturing and job creation has always been a highlight of all politicians, independent of their party, that part has not been touched,” said Martin Pochtaruk, CEO of Heliene, which runs 1.3 gigawatts of domestic module production in Minnesota. However, the new law “has axed the businesses of many of our clients two years out, so it will require a lot of work by a lot of people to reshuffle how their businesses are run, and how they finance.”
The one major change the law did make to the manufacturing tax credit was to add in “foreign entity of concern,” or FEOC, restrictions, a whole new bureaucratic regime that polices companies’ corporate or supply-chain ties to China. New FEOC restrictions also apply to energy projects, and they actually resemble policies several domestic manufacturers have been requesting for years.
Take the case of Energy, a solar manufacturer currently churning out 12,000 modules a day outside Dallas, on track for up to 3 gigawatts produced this year. Chinese giant Trina Solar actually built the factory but FEOC measures “good policy.”
“It promotes U.S. ownership and control of solar manufacturing and solar production,” Gold said. “Given how important solar is becoming on our power grids, that’s totally appropriate.”
Dean Solon, the [billionaire solar entrepreneur](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/dean-solon-create-energy-manufacturing) who has manufactured connectors and cabling systems in Tennessee since the dawn of the modern solar industry, seemed unconcerned when I asked him in June about whether the new FEOC rules were too stringent.
“FEOC? Isn’t that a shitty little Italian car?” he responded.
For now, solar manufacturers that have factories operating or nearly operational can squint and see a good few years ahead while the tax credits are still accessible, though after that, it’s anybody’s guess. Companies that were about to commit to the multiyear effort to build new factories, however, just got an undeniable signal from Congress to take their jobs and economic dynamism elsewhere.
“The hill’s a lot steeper than it was before this for those kinds of investments,” said Mike Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America Coalition. 
## **Weathering slower solar demand**
Somewhat improbably, Trump’s signature policy effort let the Biden-era clean energy manufacturing credit continue as planned before phasing down after 2030 and stopping entirely in 2033 (except for wind manufacturing, which got whacked with an early end).
Unlike the earlier House version, Gold noted, the law preserves [transferability](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/climatetech-finance/new-tax-credit-transfer-rules-could-unlock-1t-in-cleantech-investment), which lets factories monetize their credits when they lack sufficient tax burden themselves; factories cost a lot up front before they start making money, so this is especially useful in their early years. Factories almost lost stackability, which guarantees credits for companies that produce several steps of the supply chain, but the final text preserved that, Gold added.
“When you look at , which is what solar manufacturers do receive, it is exactly like what was included in the Inflation Reduction Act and proposed by Sen. Ossoff in the Build Back Better days,” Pochtaruk said.
That has direct implications for a solar cell factory Pochtaruk was developing somewhere in the U.S. but [put on hold after the election](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-manufacturing/us-solar-manufacturing-is-finally-thriving-will-trump-derail-it) as he waited to see if would survive. Now that its fate is clear, Heliene can return to developing that factory, if the company determines it still makes sense in the new market landscape.
The major lingering concern for solar manufacturers is what happens next with their customers. The law, after all, attacks the demand-side credits that were designed to stimulate purchases of made-in-America solar products.
The early demise of the solar deployment credits will hit manufacturers in two major ways.
First, with the stroke of Trump’s pen, the amount of clean energy projects expected to come online in the U.S. over the next decade just dropped. Demand for the American factories that opened up to serve that market just took a commensurate hit. Americans pay a lot more for solar panels than the rest of the world, due to the trade protectionism in place to help factories here; thus, U.S.-made solar is for U.S. consumers, and can’t readily export to foreign markets if domestic demand suddenly drops.
Second, in destroying the solar deployment credits, Republicans also eliminated the [domestic content adder](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/could-the-inflation-reduction-act-revive-solar-manufacturing-in-the-u-s), a bonus incentive that encouraged developers to pick domestic equipment over cheap imports.
“They removed the key incentive driving investment in American manufacturing of solar technology,” Ossoff said. “Go ask the industry. This is a huge gift to the Chinese Communist Party, which will reinforce China’s stranglehold on the solar value chain.”
Marta Stoepker, a spokesperson for Qcells, which runs the [largest solar-module factory](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/how-dalton-georgia-went-from-carpet-capital-to-solartown-usa) in the U.S., located in Dalton, Georgia, corroborated the importance of that policy for encouraging domestic purchases.
“Policy levers like domestic content and trade are critical to ensuring U.S.-made solar can compete against China,” she said.
That said, the new megabill might leave a path for solar installations to continue at a healthy clip for the next five years. It’s the five years after that when solar could fall off a cliff.
Under the new law, solar developers need to start building their projects between now and July 4, 2026, to secure the full 30% investment tax credit. (If they start after that date, arrays must be placed in service by the end of 2027.) Starting Jan. 1 next year, companies will also need to meet the newly written FEOC rules that limit the amount of Chinese-produced materials in a power plant. As far as the IRS is concerned, developers have officially started building once they begin physical construction or buy 5% of the overall capital cost of the project — say by purchasing transformers or inverters. Then, under what’s called 
That timeline, then, could support something close to the recent high level of solar deployment into 2030, which would be great for newly minted factories that need a little more time to get their footing. Qcells is racing to finish a new factory in Cartersville, Georgia, that will produce 3.4 gigawatts of panels and the cells and wafers that go into them. is still ramping up to its full capacity of 5 gigawatts.
If the market follows the pattern from previous times Congress was set to end solar incentives, developers will rush to safe-harbor projects before the deadline, fast-tracking work that could have been spaced out over the next few years. Then they’ll have several more years to buy the rest of the project equipment, giving domestic factories more time to spin up.
Nonetheless, factories will have to navigate upheaval among their customers in the mad dash to lock in these incentives. Larger developers can afford to hustle and start a number of projects in the next year to secure the full tax credit. Smaller developers typically finish and sell projects to finance their next efforts, a strategy that could be foiled by this truncated timeline.
“There is going to be consolidation, because the larger entities will buy out projects developed by smaller ones that cannot continue to bring them forward,” said Pochtaruk.
## **Unknowns ahead: Political cudgels and the post-ITC era**
Besides the impending blows to domestic demand, a few other variables could skew the fate of the solar manufacturing renaissance.
For one thing, manufacturers will have to navigate the new FEOC rules themselves, proving they are not beholden to China in order to claim the manufacturing credit. The firms who spoke with Canary Media said that, right now, doing so seems manageable, but a lot depends on [how the final IRS guidance is written](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/china-foreign-entity-rules-trump). The Treasury Department has until the end of 2026 to issue rules, according to the budget law.
Despite the uncertainty, some are very confident they’ll make do.
“Our optimism comes from having spent the last six or seven months working through these issues,” said Gold, whose company moved to ensure U.S. control of the factory before Trump took office. “We could give a workshop on how to achieve compliance, by this point. We’re not going to, because we want a competitive advantage, but we could.”
Not everyone is so sanguine. One alarming scenario would be if the administration uses new FEOC rules to launch investigations into clean energy manufacturers or developers. Ossoff deemed that a clear danger.
“It’s the most corrupt administration in American history, and they will wield implementation as a political cudgel,” Ossoff said. “They’ll pick winners and losers based on political considerations.”
As if to underscore that exact point, the White House published an “restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.” Those safe-harbor rules are the same ones providing something of a lifeline to the American solar factories over the next few years. The solar industry is watching this measure intently to see how it affects the already-distorted outlook for the market.
“This is a longstanding, well-established set of practices,” Carr said of the IRS safe-harbor rules. If something happened to upend that established precedent, “basically everybody in the industry would sue pretty much immediately.”
Should manufacturers make it through the near-term turbulence, they’ll still have to figure out what happens to the solar market after the current tax credit-fueled runway peters out around 2030. That future could always involve a policy swing away from the current trajectory.
Over the last decade, solar tax credits have shown a Houdini-esque ability to bounce back from certain death through 
“There will be no tax equity — there will be equity and debt, like on all projects in the rest of the planet,” Pochtaruk said. “There’s no tax credits in Chile, in South Africa, in Australia, in Namibia. Pick a country where solar is the most-deployed power generation source; [it’s happening] with no tax credits.”","Clean energy manufacturing, Climatetech finance, Policy regulation, Solar",solar-factories-outlook-trump-megabill.md,articles_clean-energy-manufacturing

President Donald Trump’s [attacks on federal climate policy](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/trumps-climate-spending-freeze-is-already-causing-serious-economic-harm) and his [supply-chain-scrambling tariffs](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/trump-tariffs-clean-energy-industry) are taking a toll on the clean-energy manufacturing boom.
In the first three months of this year, firms have already abandoned plans to build nearly $8 billion worth of clean energy projects — mostly factories that would have produced everything from grid batteries to electric vehicles, 2022 and 2024, a total of just $2.1 billion in investment was canceled.
The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by former President Joe Biden in August 2022, unleashed a torrent of new [clean energy projects](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-manufacturing/the-us-clean-energy-manufacturing-revolution-is-real).
The manufacturing sector has seen a particularly notable uptick since the law went into effect.
100 billion worth of EV assembly facilities, solar-panel factories, battery recycling plants, and more have been announced since the passage of the law, which created tax incentives as well as grant and loan programs for domestic clean-energy manufacturing.
In total, those projects are expected to create over 109,000 permanent jobs nationwide; the U.S. currently has around 12.8 million 
But now, under President Trump, the trend has started to go in reverse.
Construction spending on factories has plateaued. Firms are [pausing](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-manufacturing/us-solar-manufacturing-is-finally-thriving-will-trump-derail-it) and [scaling down](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/kore-power-has-a-new-plan-after-canceling-1-2b-battery-plant-in-arizona) investment plans. Others are outright canceling projects due to Trump’s policies: Take Prysmian Group, for example, which earlier this year 300 million offshore wind cable manufacturing facility at the site of a retired coal plant in Somerset, Massachusetts. For the first time since began tracking the data in 2022, canceled investments in cleantech manufacturing outweigh new investments, and it’s not particularly close.

https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-manufacturing/factories-jobs-economic-impact,Just how many jobs and GDP dollars do US clean energy factories create?,20 May 2025,Julian Spector,"A new report aims to quantify how much domestic solar, wind, and battery production uplifts local economies. Its authors hope Republicans in Congress will take note.

American manufacturing has already surged in the clean energy sector, bringing with it significant economic rewards.
That’s the main takeaway from a 200 operating across 38 states as of early 2025. The production of solar panels leads the count with at least 90 facilities. About 65 factories are making batteries, while a smaller number produce equipment for onshore and offshore wind. A broader population of over 800 facilities plays a supporting role in the clean energy supply chain, manufacturing materials and subcomponents that turn the solar panels and batteries into full-fledged power plants.
Those facilities already contribute 122,000 jobs and create $33 billion of economic activity annually, which includes earnings, goods and services produced, and payments to supporting industries, ACP found. Notably, 73% of these factories operate in what the report describes as “Republican states” (as determined by presidential vote). That economic impact could grow to $164 billion by 2030 if the currently planned and announced factories come to fruition.
The report came out as ACP met for its annual conference in Phoenix, but the intended audience includes the Republican members of Congress who will soon vote on cuts to the slew of tax credits underpinning this factory buildout. The report asserts that the burgeoning cleantech factory sector could “be the foundation for American energy dominance that is built by Americans for Americans.”
“We have seen a tremendous amount of momentum over just even the past couple of years in clean energy manufacturing growth,” MJ Shiao, ACP’s vice president of supply chain and manufacturing, said on a press call Friday. “With stable tax and stable trade policy, we can really continue to amplify, grow that momentum.”
Clean energy leaders have spent the months since the November election hoping that the sheer economic dynamism their factories [inject into Republican congressional districts](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/republican-tax-credits-ira-repeal) could overcome President Donald Trump’s desire to unravel Joe Biden’s legacies. It didn’t help that the Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act, with its many highly targeted tax credits for clean energy deployment and manufacturing, on a party-line vote. 
States that reelected President Donald Trump in 2024 also host the lion’s share of the domestic clean energy factories, which bring relatively high-wage jobs to their communities. (ACP)
But enough Republican representatives publicly argued against a wholesale repeal of the credits to give cleantech insiders hope. Indeed, the House Ways and Means Committee declined to eradicate the credits entirely in its budget proposal from last week. But the proposed tweaks to many of the individual programs narrow their scope and could [render them wholly unworkable](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/republican-tax-bill-credits-china) nonetheless.
“If they are implemented as currently drafted, which we certainly hope they are not, we will see factories shutting down,” Shiao said. “We will see these American manufacturers have to lay people off, and we will see them having to tell their local business partners that they no longer have the opportunity to work with them.”
In that light, the ACP report reads as a tabulation of what the country could miss out on if policy changes underway in Washington bring the onshoring trend to a staggering halt.
The manufacturing job count could grow to 579,000 by 2030 if the other announced factory projects get built and come online. Total job count doesn’t confirm how desirable the work is, but these jobs happen to pay quite well, especially solar manufacturing salaries, which averaged $134,000 in 2024.
A Canary Media visit to the enormous [QCells solar factory](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/how-dalton-georgia-went-from-carpet-capital-to-solartown-usa) in Dalton, Georgia, last year showed why this work pays more than traditional manufacturing. The brand-new factories leverage considerable automation and robotic assistance for the heavy lifting and repetitive, high-precision tasks. Workers patrolled the lines and intervened when the machinery needed help. That greater output of an in-demand, high-tech product supported considerably higher pay than the carpet factories down the road.
“This is not our parents’ generation’s manufacturing,” Shiao said. “There is automation, there is robotics, there is AI in these facilities. And that’s a good thing, because these are high-tech, high-skill opportunities that are being brought into some of these communities that are really eager to find ways to keep their best, keep their brightest in the places that they grow up in.”
Across cleantech factories, annual earnings from clean energy manufacturing averaged $118,000, the study found, well above the average U.S. worker’s pay of $76,000.
It’s not just immediate employees who benefit, though. First comes the intensive but temporary construction phase. Once complete, the factories create additional work for support services in the region, such as shipping and delivery companies, food vendors, hotels for visiting customers, and waste disposal. Domestic manufacturing also relies on other component suppliers: Utility-scale solar panels sit on American steel trackers, covered in U.S.-made solar glass. The authors calculate that each job in a clean energy factory leads to three more in supporting industries.
U.S. energy-related factories have opened at a steady clip over the last four years, bolstered by growing demand and targeted industrial policies. (ACP)
This reality sounds a lot like the vision that Trump campaigned on last year, of growing jobs at home by restoring U.S. manufacturing from the ravages of globalization. He also repeatedly emphasizes a desire to secure more critical minerals for the U.S.; clean energy technologies provide much of the expected demand growth for those minerals.
“This administration talks a lot about an all-of-the-above energy strategy that facilitates American energy dominance,” Shiao said. “I think there needs to continue to be that recognition that solar, wind, energy storage are key pieces and critical pieces to realizing that growth, certainly in terms of the speed at which those projects can be deployed.”
The Ways and Means budget proposal dealt a blow to the cleantech industry’s hopes for a predictable investment landscape. It was also the opening volley of a weekslong negotiating process that will soon involve the Senate as well. Amid all that uncertainty, ACP has at least provided some fresh numbers on the value clean energy factories have created in their short moment of ascendancy, as well as helped clarify what’s at stake.
“We think we’ve got a winning message, one that is bringing positivity, and of course, economic growth to the country,” said John Hensley, ACP’s senior vice president of markets and policy analysis. “We’re going to continue to tell that story, and hopefully it lands on ears that are willing to listen.”","Clean energy manufacturing, Clean energy, Clean energy jobs",factories-jobs-economic-impact.md,articles_clean-energy-manufacturing

Just under three years ago, the Inflation Reduction Act went into law and generated tens of billions of dollars’ worth of investment in domestic manufacturing of clean energy technologies. President Donald Trump has turned that wave into a ripple.
Since Trump took office in late January, companies have paused, canceled, or shuttered 26 different manufacturing projects that would have brought $27.6 billion in investment and nearly 19,000 jobs to communities across America, according to new data from 
Over that same time period, 29 new projects were announced for a total of just $3 billion.
Under the Biden administration, companies pledged [well over $100 billion](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-manufacturing/trump-ev-battery-factory-cancellations) in factory investment, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act’s incentives for manufacturers and for project developers and people to buy American-made solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles, and more. The cleantech manufacturing surge was so significant that it pushed overall 
Areas represented by Republicans in Congress stand to gain the most from this factory boom. More than 80% of the clean-energy manufacturing investment announced as of February would [flow to Republican-led districts](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-manufacturing/chart-gop-districts-to-lose-big-if-trump-halts-clean-energy-factories); over 70% of the jobs would go to these places.
But under [Trump’s new “big, beautiful” law](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/trump-big-beautiful-bill-industry-impacts), the future of those projects is less certain.
The law [did not repeal tax credits](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/tax-credit-changes-trump-law) for most clean-energy manufacturers, but it will eat away at their customer base by scrapping subsidies for wind and solar developers. It also introduced strict [anti-China stipulations](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/china-foreign-entity-rules-trump) to the manufacturing tax credit, which could be a headache for companies to comply with, depending on how the Treasury Department decides to enforce the rules.
These factors, in addition to the increasingly volatile business environment in the U.S., do not bode well for the clean-energy manufacturing boom regaining momentum in the near term. Nor do Trump’s beloved tariffs hold much promise as a way forward. Previous attempts to boost domestic solar-panel manufacturing [via tariffs alone have failed](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/the-fight-over-us-solar-tariffs-hasnt-gone-away-its-just-hibernating), and 
That’s not to say cleantech manufacturing is now a lost cause in the U.S. — [some solar producers, for example, are feeling optimistic](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-manufacturing/solar-factories-outlook-trump-megabill). But what’s increasingly clear is that the short-lived boom times are over, and any manufacturing success stories from this point on will be in spite of the federal government rather than because of its generous support.","Clean energy manufacturing, Clean energy supply chain, Policy regulation",trump-investments-drop-ira.md,articles_clean-energy-manufacturing
