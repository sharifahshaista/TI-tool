    "content": "New Zealand has published a detailed guide for businesses for the adoption of geoheat technologies, or the direct use of geothermal for heating and cooling. The[ New Zealand Geothermal Association](https://www.nzgeothermal.org.nz/) (NZGA) has published a Geoheat business guide that provides businesses with practical guidance on adopting geoheat, or the direct use of geothermal energy for heating and cooling. The guide was created in collaboration with [GeoExchange NZ](https://www.geoexchange.nz/) and [Traverse Environmental](https://traverse.co.nz/) with support from the [Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority](https://www.eeca.govt.nz/) (EECA). [**Click here to access the full document, “Geoheat business guide in Aotearoa New Zealand.”**](https://www.eeca.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Geoheat-business-guide-in-Aotearoa.pdf) Geothermal resources are widespread across Aotearoa, extending beyond the well-known high-temperature fields of the central North Island. These resources include ambient and geothermally enhanced groundwater, as well as deeper thermal systems associated with fault zones, remnant volcanism, and the natural geothermal gradient. While high-temperature systems are typically used for electricity generation, Geoheat technologies enable the direct use of lower-temperature geothermal resources for industrial, commercial and building-scale applications. Industrial applications of geoheat is already a well-established practice in New Zealand, as demonstrated by the[ dairy processing facility of Miraka Dairy in Taupo](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/nz-dairy-company-highly-successful-with-use-of-geothermal-heat/) and the [toilet paper and tissue manufacturing of Essity in Kawerau](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-zealand-tissue-and-toilet-paper-company-shifts-to-100-geothermal/). The guide tackles the basics of geothermal resource types while providing high-level guidance on available technologies to harness geoheat, including ground source heat pumps and ground heat exchangers. Potential geoheat users can also benefit from a overview of the resource consent framework, including the distinction between regional and territorial authority functions, and the importance of early planning and engagement with mana whenua and other potentially affected parties.",

    "content": "The plans for geothermal development in Nevis were highlighted during the Geothermal Energy Forum, part of the 2025 Global Sustainable Islands Summit. The island of Nevis recently hosted [the Global Sustainable Islands Summit Geothermal Energy Forum](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-in-focus-at-global-islands-summit-2025-25-30-may-2025-st-kitts-and-nevis/), attracting a host of participants and putting the spotlight on Nevis’ pioneering geothermal energy ambitions. The one-day event attracted over 60 participants, including regional government officials, private sector partners, utility representatives, development agencies, academic institutions, and sustainability experts. In delivering the opening welcome, Premier of Nevis and Minister of Energy in the [Nevis Island Administration](https://nia.gov.kn/) (NIA), the Honourable Mark Brantley, outlined Nevis’ strategic vision for geothermal development, emphasizing the island’s potential as a leader in clean energy for the Eastern Caribbean. _“We have a considerable resource on the island. This is a resource which we feel, if honest, can be transformative, not only for this island, but for the wider Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis, and indeed for our sub-region._ _“What does harnessing this resource look like? It means, of course, that we get clean, reliable energy. We get energy that we hope is significantly cheaper than the energy that we now consume, which comes from diesel… and that, ultimately, we transform our economy.”_ Premier Brantley described the geothermal initiative as a “glorious opportunity,” reaffirming Nevis’ commitment to becoming part of a sustainable island state. _“I think the opportunities are truly endless… Our capacity to market this asset is absolutely incredible. St. Kitts is on board with us… and the Federal Government is committed to this idea.”_ Other dignitaries delivering opening remarks included Honourable Konris Maynard, Minister of Energy & Utilities in the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis and Chair of the OECS Council of Ministers of Energy; and James Ellsmoor, CEO of[ Island Innovation](https://islandinnovation.co/). Ellsmoor provided an overview of the Global Sustainable Islands Summit brand and its mission to support island resilience through sustainable development. Throughout the forum, delegates explored topics including innovation in geothermal technology for island nations, investment strategies for scaling up geothermal in the Caribbean, and the role of geothermal in enhancing climate resilience and energy security. Premier Brantley was also featured on the panel “Financing the Future of Geothermal Energy,” which examined funding models, risk management strategies, and public-private collaboration to advance geothermal development in island contexts. Panelists included representatives from development banks and private sector investors. Top officials from the Nevis Electricity Company (NEVLEC), along with the Honourable Spencer Brand, Minister of Physical Planning and Environment in the NIA also participated on separate panels. Delegates were treated to a field trip to Nevis’ geothermal development site in Hamilton, offering a unique opportunity to see first-hand the island’s efforts to tap into its geothermal potential. The day concluded with a closing reception, fostering continued networking and collaboration. Entities represented at the Forum included NEVLEC, SKELEC, Inter-American Development Bank, Caribbean Development Bank, CARICOM Development Fund, OECS Commission, Caribbean Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (CCREEE), UK Envoy for Small Island Developing States, Ormat Technologies, University of the West Indies, University of Oxford, Dominica Geothermal Development Company, EDA Renováveis, Global Center for Climate Mobility, Blue Planet Alliance, Renewable Energy Sector Development Project (Saint Lucia), Members of the Nevis Island Administration Cabinet, and representatives from the governments of Grenada and Hawaii. Held as part of the Global Sustainable Islands Summit 2025, which runs from May 26–30 across St. Kitts and Nevis, the Geothermal Forum aimed to showcase Nevis’ journey toward energy independence while facilitating regional cooperation around geothermal scalability, innovation, and investment.",

Geothermal power generation stands to benefit from a recent Executive Order released by the Trump Administration to accelerate federal permitting for data center infrastructure in the United States. The goal of the EO is to ease federal regulatory burdens for AI data centers and supporting infrastructure, including power generation and transmission facilities. In more specific terms, “geothermal power equipment” is included in the EO’s “Covered Components” or the materials, products, and infrastructure that are required to build data center projects. Moreover, this means that geothermal power projects or facilities for manufacturing of geothermal power equipment can be considered “Covered Component Projects” under the EO. Covered Component Projects may benefit from the EO if they are considered “Qualifying Projects.” These refer to projects that satisfy a few conditions, including: * Involving an incremental electric load addition of greater than 100 MW; * A project that protects national security; * A project for which the Project Sponsor has committed at least $500 million in capital expenditures * A project that has been designated as “Qualifying Project” by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, or the Secretary of Energy The EO aims to facilitate the development of Qualifying Projects through the following measures: * Potential financial support for Qualifying Projects, which could include loans and loan guarantees, grants, tax incentives, and offtake agreements; * The establishment of new categorical exclusions to cover actions related to Qualifying Projects that normally do not have a significant effect on the human environment. * The possibility of transitioning eligible Qualifying Projects to FAST-41 “covered projects” * Expedited permit review on Federal and non-Federal lands * The identification of suitable sites on Federal lands to be offered under competitive lease to Qualifying Projects Several planned data center projects in the US and around the world are already being developed under agreements to be supplied with geothermal power, including projects by planned by [Meta in New Mexico](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/google-baseload-capital-ink-geothermal-ppa-in-taiwan/), and by [Google in Taiwan](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/google-baseload-capital-ink-geothermal-ppa-in-taiwan/).",

The Government of Ecuador, through the Ministry of Energy and Mines, has signed a letter of intent to begin the roadmap for the development of the Tufiño-Chiles-Cerro Negro geothermal project. This is a binational project, located at a site that straddles the border between Ecuador and Colombia. The project, targeted for a 138-MW development, will be developed in the Maldonado and Tufiño, in the province of Carchi. The development roadmap includes the following activities: * Update of geoscientific, environmental and social studies; * Exploratory drilling to validate technical feasibility; * Comprehensive assessment of technical, environmental and financial feasibility; * Promotion of the project to attract public or private investment; * Preparation for the execution of a pilot or modular plant. The initial stage will focus on conducting pre-feasibility studies and conducing outreach to the relevant communities. The Ministry of Energy and Mines and the local government of Carchi will create a technical group to coordinate and monitor the execution of the project. The Minister of Energy and Mines, Inés Manzano, emphasized that the project is strategic for Ecuador: _“This project represents a key opportunity for sustainable energy generation. Furthermore, it will consolidate its position as an infrastructure that will harness the energy potential of our land.”_ It has been several years since there was a clear display of interest in developing the Tufiño geothermal site. Back in 2013, [the Governments of Ecuador and Colombia signed a cooperation agreement](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/ecuador-and-colombia-sign-agreement-on-tufino-project/) for the development of the project with a target start of operations by 2018. The target date has evidently gone past and the progress reported on the project was limited to community outreach efforts. Back in 2013, a company called Isagen had [plans to drill a thermal gradient well](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/isagen-preparing-exploratory-drilling-for-project-in-colombia/) in Tufiño. However, this did not proceed as the company did not have approval from the local community. According to some community members, the company had not included a large part of the community during the consultation and socialization phases, eventually resulting legal measures against the project.",

    "content": "The YOM consortium has secured the permit for a seismic survey to explore geothermal resources in the northern Vaud region in Switzerland. The YOM consortium has acquired the necessary permit to conduct a joint geothermal resource exploration campaign covering 29 municipalities in the northern Vaud region in Switzerland. A seismic campaign survey is expected to commence by October 2025, which is expected to take around three weeks. The YOM consortium [was launched in late 2024](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/consortium-formed-to-explore-geothermal-in-north-vaud-switzerland/) as a partnership between three companies – [Y-CAD SA](http://www.ycad.ch/), [Orllati Real Estate SA](https://www.orllati.ch/), and [MalmEnergie Naturelle SA.](https://www.stoll-freres.ch/) Each of the consortium members holds a surface exploration permit covering distinct areas in the Yverdon-les-Bains region, as well as different specializations and experience. The first phase of the project, called GéothermY, involves establishing a 3D map of the subsurface of the study site. To do this, a total of 20,000 geophones will be deployed and placed on the ground. These will record the seismic data emitted by vibrating trucks and reflected by different layers in the subsurface. [Real-time reporting of the progress of the GéothermY phase is available at the official project page.](https://geothermy.ch/#suivi) Seismic data acquisition is expected to end by November 2025. The data will be processed and analyzed during the next 6-12 months. According to Pierre-Alain Kreutschy, Director General of Y-CAD, all the acquired data from the study will be made publicly available by the consortium after two years. The exploration campaign will provide valuable information that will improve knowledge of the subsurface and enable geothermal drilling in the region. If the results are promising, the plan is for drilling to commence by 2027. Medium-depth geothermal resources in the Yverdon-les-Bains region are primarily intended to provide heat for heating buildings and neighborhoods through district heating networks and agricultural greenhouses, for producing domestic hot water, and for industrial and agricultural processes. Electricity generation can also be considered depending on the knowledge gained from medium-depth drilling, and the level of maturity of appropriate technologies.",

    "content": "Stimulation tests have been completed at the Haute-Sorne geothermal project in Switzerland, and data will be processed to decide on the project's next steps. * A temperature measurement was done at 3986 meters, indicating 135 °C, in line with expectations. A temperature of over 150°C is expected in the future geothermal reservoir at a depth of 4,500 to 5,000 meters. * The borehole casing was then perforated to a depth of 3,800 meters. * Eight seismometers were lowered to the bottom of the borehole. These were calibrated using a vibrating truck. * Water injection began on 8 July. This was done using pumps normally installed in the underground laboratory in Val Bedretto and loaned by ETH Zurich. Over several days, the flow rate and pressure were gradually increased, reaching a maximum of 80 l/min and 270 bar. * Water injection was stopped on July 14 due to the threshold magnitude being reached twice, in accordance with established guidelines. The well was opened to relieve pressure. The total injected volume was 430 cubic meters. The plan included an optional second stimulation cycle (500 cubic meters), but this was not necessary, as sufficient data was acquired. * Complementary hydraulic and geophysical measurements and monitoring and observation of seismicity, reflux, and all the monitored parameters were done unit the last day on 31 July. For background, the project parameters states that the injection will be temporarily suspended for analysis if the seismicity reaches a magnitude of 0.3. Moreover, the tests will be permanently stopped if magnitude 0.9 was reached. If the magnitude were to reach 1.5, the well pressure will be released. The data collected will make it possible to characterize the mechanical and hydraulic properties of the rock and thus define the operational parameters of the effective stimulation (pressures, flow rates, durations) and the optimal orientation of the future horizontal drilling. Stimulation of the geothermal reservoir is planned during the second phase. Several specialists were on hand 24/7 to ensure that operations were done safely and according to agreed upon threshold standards. Although the injection was carried out continuously, no noise pollution was created. Environmental monitoring, including the analysis of flowback water, was done by a qualified engineering firm. The well seismometers recorded a total of 3,387 seismic events as of 31 July, all of very low magnitude. Only four tremors could be detected during injections by the surface network and located by the Swiss Seismological Service (SED) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), as part of its independent basic seismic monitoring. The strongest tremor detected on this network was at a 0.3 magnitude. As expected, seismic activity decreased sharply as soon as injections ended. It is now only 2 or 3 microseisms per day, compared to several hundred during the tests. Continuous monitoring of pressure and seismicity remains in place. Over the next few months, operational activities will be limited to maintenance work and any additional measurements. Analysis of the collected data will then follow, which will allow for the updating of the geological model and risk studies. A corresponding report wil be sent to the relevant authorities. The project can proceed only if all safety guarantees are met.",

    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "23 Sep 2025",
    "content": "The GEOFLEXHEAT project aims to bridge the gap between existing geothermal district heating solutions and the growing need for large-scale high-density systems. The European geothermal sector is evolving rapidly, driven by the dual pressures of decarbonization and energy resilience. Real-world installations like Denmark’s [_Hyllegaard Høje Thermonet_](https://thermonet.eu/projects/hyllegaard-hoeje/), the data and trends presented in the [_EGEC Geothermal Market Report 2024_](https://www.egec.org/media-publications/egec-market-report-2024-key-findings/), and the cutting-edge research of [GEOFLEXHEAT](https://www.geoflexheat.eu/) collectively highlight a sector in transition — from small-scale residential heating to high-temperature, digitally optimized, industrial-grade geothermal solutions. Together, these three perspectives create a roadmap for how Europe can unlock geothermal’s untapped potential. **Lessons from Hyllegaard Høje: modular, community-based thermonet ** In Hvalsø, Zealand, Hyllegaard Høje represents [Denmark’s largest horizontal geothermal thermonet](https://thermonet.eu/projects/hyllegaard-hoeje/) to date, connecting 200 homes through 30 km of buried piping and a dedicated energy community that integrates local solar PV generation. Its design allows incremental expansion as new cohousing clusters come online, supported by a design manual and standardized connection processes. Technically, this project demonstrates: * Low-temperature district heating (\\~45 °C supply / \\~30 °C return) for residential needs. * Decentralized or centralized heat pump strategies for flexibility. * A community ownership and governance model that simplifies financing and grid integration. This model showcases how geothermal heating can be embedded in urban planning, reducing emissions and creating energy resilience at a neighbourhood scale. However, the approach is limited in temperature delivery and primarily suited for low-density residential demand, reflecting a broader trend identified by EGEC. The [EGEC Geothermal Market Report 2024](https://www.egec.org/media-publications/egec-market-report-2024-key-findings/) paints a mixed picture for the European sector: * Pipeline growth is significant, with 500+ district heating and cooling (DHC) projects under development and a potential doubling of installed capacity by 2030. * Technical and regulatory hurdles — permitting delays, exploration complexity, and financing risk — are slowing down deployment timelines. * Innovation needs include: * Higher-temperature systems for industrial applications, * Integration of Thermal Energy Storage (TES), * More robust digital monitoring and control tools to de-risk investments. The report highlights geothermal’s role in relieving electrical grid stress, particularly during demand peaks, and anticipates support from the European Geothermal Action Plan to address structural barriers. The market’s message is clear: while grassroots initiatives like Hyllegaard demonstrate feasibility and social acceptance, the next leap requires technical innovation that pushes beyond residential heating and enables geothermal to serve industrial, high-density, and flexible energy systems. **GEOFLEXHEAT: closing the innovation gap** **Innovation** | **Contribution to sector needs** ---|--- Heat Pipe Heat Exchanger & Scaling Reactor | Extracts more energy per well and mitigates mineral scaling, reducing operation and maintenance costs and enabling mineral byproduct recovery. High-Temperature Heat Pump (HTHP) | Raises geothermal output to >110 °C, meeting industrial steam demand—expanding geothermal beyond residential DH. TES & Steam Accumulators | Provide dispatchable thermal energy, supporting grid balancing and industrial flexibility. Digital Twin and Control Strategy | Simulates and optimizes system performance in real time, reducing operational risk and accelerating permitting. Commercialisation Roadmap & Social Acceptance Guide | Builds on lessons from community-led projects like Hyllegaard, scaling them to pan-European industrial systems. By integrating these elements, GEOFLEXHEAT turns geothermal into a flexible, multi-use resource — a key lever for Europe’s decarbonization plans. The three sources form a continuum of innovation: 1. Hyllegaard Høje provides proof of concept for scalable, low-temperature, community-owned geothermal solutions. 2. EGEC’s market report highlights systemic challenges — from permitting to scalability — that limit replication and industrial deployment. 3. GEOFLEXHEAT delivers the technical answers, moving geothermal into higher-value markets through advanced heat exchange, heat pumps, TES, and digitalization. Together, these perspectives create a technology-to-market pipeline: pilot and community projects like Hyllegaard showcase feasibility and build social trust; market data and policy identify bottlenecks and future opportunities; and last but not least, R&I initiatives deliver transformative solutions to overcome those bottlenecks. This approach ensures geothermal energy progresses from niche residential heating to a central pillar of Europe’s renewable energy mix. By 2030, integrating modular thermonet deployment with high-temperature heat extraction and TES could enable: * Urban and industrial hubs to decarbonize heating at scale. * Communities to actively manage energy at neighbourhood level, as in Hyllegaard. * A mature geothermal sector supported by EU-wide innovation, investment, and permitting reform. In this ecosystem, GEOFLEXHEAT is the missing link: it connects grassroots innovation and market intelligence with high-impact technological advances, positioning Europe as a global leader in geothermal energy.

Houston, Texas-based [Renascent Energy](https://www.renascentenergy.us/) has announced the successful completion of the first geothermal test utilizing a depleted shale well at the Eagle Ford shale formation in South Texas. This marks a major achievement, pioneering the potential transformation of thousands of shut-in and marginal deep shale wells into the lowest-cost baseload geothermal energy producers, thus also positioning Texas as a leader in clean energy innovation. The Renascent Energy team activated a large fracture system in the deep depleted Eagle Ford gas well, achieving substantial injection rates without re-fracking the shale formation.

    "content": "Türkiye is exploring lithium and rare metal extraction from geothermal brine, aiming to boost its EV battery supply chain and geothermal sector development. Türkiye is stepping up efforts to extract lithium and other strategic minerals from its geothermal resources, signaling a new chapter in the country’s geothermal development. With only about 10% of its geothermal potential currently utilized, Türkiye is looking beyond power and heat production toward integrating mineral recovery from geothermal brine. According to Ufuk Sentürk, chairman of the Turkish Geothermal Power Plant Investors Association (JESDER), the country operates over 1,000 geothermal wells capable of producing 100,000 tons of hot water per hour. This geothermal brine contains valuable metals such as lithium, germanium, selenium, and others, offering an opportunity to bolster Turkey’s energy transition and local industrial supply chains. Research efforts involving the German Energy Agency and local universities show promising early results for lithium recovery. While the average lithium concentration in Turkish geothermal waters is about 20 ppm – lower than the 100 ppm seen in parts of Germany—the scale of geothermal operations could yield up to 35,000 tons of lithium annually. This would represent close to 10% of global production in 2024. Such output could strategically position Türkiye within the electric vehicle (EV) battery supply chain. The country already hosts automotive plants by manufacturers such as Toyota, Renault, and Ford, and is promoting domestic EV production and energy storage systems. Utilizing geothermal lithium could strengthen domestic supply security and cost competitiveness. Beyond lithium, geothermal fluids may also offer economically viable extraction of metals like zinc and manganese, important for batteries and electronics. Systematic sampling and geological mapping are underway to assess broader mineral extraction potential. Türkiye’s state-owned mining company Eti Maden is also moving forward with a pilot lithium carbonate production plant using boron ore wastewaters, targeting 10 tons of output annually. This facility, set to launch before the end of the year, will help validate new technologies for lithium extraction and pave the way for geothermal integration. The government continues to support geothermal applications beyond power, with geothermal heat now used for 160,000 households and 7,000 hectares of greenhouses. Combining thermal energy use with mineral recovery could significantly enhance the sector’s overall economic value. Environmental concerns are also a key driver. Compared to conventional mining or salt lake evaporation, geothermal lithium extraction has a smaller environmental footprint. Its closed-loop water circulation helps avoid land degradation and aligns better with ESG and sustainability goals. If Türkiye can successfully scale geothermal mineral extraction, it could join other global frontrunners such as California (USA), Cornwall (UK), and the Rhine Valley (Germany). With a current installed geothermal capacity of 1.74 GW—ranking fourth globally—and a remaining potential of up to 5 GW, Turkey has both the resource base and industrial motivation to become a key player in the emerging geothermal lithium sector.",

The State of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany has announced a competitive process for the takeover of a geothermal research borehole to be drilled as part of [a multi-year exploration and drilling program](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/north-rhine-westphalia-germany-publishes-geothermal-energy-master-plan/) of the [Geological Survey of North Rhine-Westphalia](https://www.gd.nrw.de/) (GD NRW) on behalf of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. **[Click here to access all documents related to the tender.](https://www.wirtschaft.nrw/themen/klimaschutz/erneuerbare-waerme/wettbewerb-geothermiebohrung)** In order to significantly improve the geothermal database and demonstrate the performance of potential geothermal reservoirs in North Rhine-Westphalia and , the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Industry, Climate Protection and Energy of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia (MWIKE) has commissioned the Geological Survey of North Rhine-Westphalia (GD NRW) to implement an exploration and drilling program for the years 2024 to 2028e. The goal of this program is to significantly reduce the discovery risk for medium-deep and deep geothermal wells through exploratory measures. In this context, the GD NRW will drill research boreholes up to 2,000 meters deep as part of the state’s geological survey. Research drilling has so far been [completed in Krefeld](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/drilling-in-krefeld-germany-identifies-deep-geothermal-reservoir/), and another will be drilled in [Cologne](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/tender-drilling-of-geothermal-research-borehole-in-dellbruck-cologne-germany/). To ensure that such wells that find success are not dismantled, heat transition project developers in North Rhine-Westphalia are seeking subsequent use. A competitive process is now underway to find a suitable location and a potential buyer for one of these wells. This will ensure that the well, should it be successful, can be immediately put to useful subsequent use. The objective of this call for competition is to determine the location of the drilling site in advance of the planning and implementation of this research drilling and, in the event of discovery, to determine a potential buyer. The buyer must pay a standard market price for the acquisition of a successful drilling. For this purpose, the potential buyer will provide GD NRW with a suitable piece of land under its control or ownership for the duration of the drilling for the preparation and implementation of this research drilling. The well will be financed by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, thus absorbing the discovery risk. Acquisition by the pre-selected buyer will only occur if the project is successful. A corresponding contract will be concluded between the buyer and MWIKE. The site’s suitability will be assessed beforehand. A jury of experts will then select the site from the remaining applications. The key selection criterion is the price offered for the successful well.",

A new daycare in the municipality of Hergensweiler in the Lindau district of Bavaria, Germany will soon be heated with geothermal energy following the approval of the municipal council for the proposed project. Starting spring 2026, the old daycare building in Hergenswelier will be demolished. Geothermal wells at depths of 100 to 150 meters will be drilled, alongside the construction of the new daycare building. The new building will be located next the Leiblachhalle sports complex and an elementary school, both of which are currently being supplied by a shared gas heating system. One of the two youth rooms in the Leiblachalle will be used to house the necessary surface equipment to support the geothermal system, particularly the heat pump. The system is designed to supply heating to the new daycare center during winter, but can also be used for cooling during the summer. _“While we primarily rely on natural cooling measures, such as cleverly placed porches, blinds, and awnings,”_ said Mayor Wolfgang Strohmaier, _“With geothermal energy, we have chosen a system that also offers us the opportunity to respond flexibly to rising temperatures – also in the future.”_ The Leiblachhalle and elementary school will also transition to a pellet heating system. A shared heating system was considered for all three buildings, but it was ultimately decided that this would be too costly and technically complex. Another factor was that the grant that the municipality applied for the project did not cover heating using biomass. The geothermal heating project for the daycare center will be supported by funding from the federal KfW 499 “Climate-Friendly New Construction” program. This specifically supports the use of renewable energies in new buildings. The municipality expects the whole budget needed for the project, at about EUR 110,000, to be covered by the program. **[RELATED: Updated map shows over 150 geothermal projects in Germany in planning phase](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/updated-map-shows-over-150-geothermal-plans-in-germany-in-planning-phase/)**",

    "content": "Strataphy has completed several drilling and testing campaigns in Saudi Arabia and aims deploy their first geothermal cooling system within the year. Geothermal cooling startup [Strataphy](https://www.strataphy.com/) has announced that it has completed multiple geothermal drilling and testing campaigns in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, spanning different locations in the west and northwest of the country. These campaigns mark a significant step forward in advancing geothermal energy applications—specifically geothermal cooling and heating—as a viable, efficient, and sustainable solution for the region. The campaigns involved drilling over 25 wellbores at varying depths of up to 250 meters, conducting more than 18 Thermal Response Tests (TRT), as well as multiple Open-Loop Geothermal Tests and Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) Tests. These efforts provided critical insights into the geothermal potential across different geological settings in Saudi Arabia. The key findings are as follows: * Shallow geothermal reservoirs have shown strong potential for highly efficient open-loop geothermal systems, with a Coefficient of Performance (COP) exceeding 5.5, making them significantly more energy-efficient than conventional cooling technologies. * Favorable subsurface thermal conductivity and diffusivity values confirm strong heat transfer characteristics, supporting both geothermal cooling and seasonal energy storage. * ATES testing results support an 80/20 cooling-to-heating split, making it an ideal solution for Saudi Arabia’s climate and energy needs. * The local supply chain is well-equipped to support geothermal adoption at a scale and quickly, leveraging existing expertise and resources from the oil and gas industry. * The economic case is strong, with geothermal cooling expected to deliver substantial cost savings compared to conventional air-based systems for various applications. These findings provide a clear path forward for large-scale geothermal cooling deployment in the Kingdom. _“The momentum behind geothermal energy in Saudi Arabia is growing, and Strataphy is proud to be a key enabler of this transition. By integrating cutting-edge technology with deep industry expertise, we are accelerating the deployment of geothermal systems that are both commercially viable and environmentally impactful,”_ said Ahmed Alhani, COO at Strataphy. With Saudi Arabia experiencing some of the highest cooling demands per capita globally, driven by rapid urbanization and large-scale construction projects, finding clean and efficient cooling solutions is a national priority. Today, 50-70% of the country’s electricity consumption is dedicated to cooling, primarily through conventional air-based systems that rely on fossil fuels and contribute to high CO? emissions. Geothermal-based cooling presents an alternative that is not only more energy-efficient but also aligns with the country’s broader sustainability goals. Strataphy has been working with sustainability-driven initiatives in Saudi Arabia to help achieve energy efficiency targets, ensuring that cooling—an essential component of the country’s energy strategy—is addressed through innovative and sustainable solutions. By integrating geothermal cooling, the country can: * Reduce electricity consumption for cooling by up to 50%, cutting operational costs for businesses and developments; * Reduce the cost of electrical grid expansion associated with projected growth in cooling demand; * Improve grid stability, especially during peak summer demand; * Significantly lower CO? emissions, supporting national and international sustainability commitments; * Enhance energy security, reducing reliance on fossil-fuel-based cooling systems. _“Geothermal energy represents a fundamental shift in how we think about sustainable cooling and heating. At Strataphy, we are not just adopting geothermal solutions; we are actively shaping the ecosystem—developing scalable projects that drive efficiency, lower emissions, and redefine energy resilience in the region,”_ said Ammar Alali, CEO at Strataphy. Saudi Arabia is home to some of the largest construction and development projects in the world, driving an increasing demand for cooling. However, the country remains reliant on air-based cooling methods that consume high amounts of electricity and contribute to emissions. Based on the findings from their recent campaigns, Strataphy is now taking action to implement geothermal cooling solutions at scale. The first fully operational geothermal cooling system in Saudi Arabia will be commissioned before the end of this year, marking the country’s first industrial-scale geothermal cooling project. More over, two additional geothermal cooling projects will begin installation in summer 2025, with commissioning expected in the near future. Strataphy is also targeting the installation of over 15+ MW-th of geothermal cooling capacity within the next three years, and 50+ MW-th in the next five years – accelerating the adoption of sustainable cooling across the Kingdom. Strataphy is transforming geothermal cooling with its proprietary and patent-pending subsurface system design and wellbore completion technologies which include an advanced geothermal cooling system and wellbore completion solutions. These innovations optimize heat exchange efficiency, adaptability across geological settings, and long-term performance. At the core of this advancement is [Strataphy’s Cooling as a Service (CAS) model](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-cooling-as-a-service-startup-announces-launch/), which provides sustainable cooling without upfront investments.

After a drilling period of two months, the drilling of production and reinjection wells for the second geothermal heating installation of [Aardwarmte Vogelaer](https://www.aardwarmtevogelaer.nl/) in the Netherlands has been completed. The second facility, which will supply geothermal heat to another 16 horticultural businesses, is expected to start operations by the end of 2025. Drilling of the doublet for the expansion of the Aardwarmte Vogelear geothermal heating facility started in September 2023. However, well integrity and completion issues were encountered, necessitating the need to drill a sidetrack well. This suspended the work in December 2023, and operations resumed again on June 2025. A sidetrack was drilled from the reinjection well to about 2800 meters, and the production well was drilled to a total depth of about 3000 meters. Even over the months when drilling had to be suspended, the company continued work on [the construction of the pipes for the heating network,](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/work-underway-for-vogelaer-geothermal-heating-expansion-netherlands/) as well as other surface facilities. The second heating facility is located next to the first geothermal installation on Arckelweg in Poeldijk. The second phase of the project was completed with Yeager Energy, which [acquired a majority stake in Aardwarmte Vogelaer in early 2025](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/yeager-energy-expands-acquisition-of-geothermal-assets-in-the-netherlands/). Thanks to optimal cooperation with all parties involved, the drilling was successful. Aardwarmte Vogelear already supplies geothermal heating to 18 greenhouse horticulture businesses in Honselersdijk, Poeldijk, and Monster in the Westland municipality in the Netherlands. There are now also plans to supply heat to over 400 homes in the Westmade Noord residential area in Monster. Eventually, the company plans to connect to the Westland heating network.",

    "content": "INGEMMET has published the results of a detailed study of the Tutupaca geothermal site in Peru, highlighting the potential for geothermal power generation. The [Geological, Mining, and Metallurgical Institute](https://www.gob.pe/ingemmet) (Instituto Geológico, Minero y Metalúrgico / INGEMMET) of Peru has published the results of detailed studies done to evaluate the potential of the Tutupaca geothermal site, located in the Candarave district the Tacna region. The full paper, **“Caracterización y evaluación del potencial geotérmico de la zona geotermal de Tutupaca, Candarave, región Tacna”** by Cruz et al, can be accessed via this link: **<https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12544/5122>** A geothermal system of volcanic origin has been identified in the Tutupaca area. The heat comes from a magma chamber that is part of the Tutupaca Volcanic Complex, a structure formed by three superimposed volcanic edifices: Tutupaca Basal, Tutupaca West, and Tutupaca Recent. The existence of this heat source is manifested on the surface through various geological elements. The field is characterized by a series of visible manifestations that indicate heat stored beneath the volcano: hot springs, fumaroles (gas emissions), acidic mud pools, and sulfur deposits. From a geological perspective, Ingemmet scientists have identified rocks dating from the Cretaceous (more than 100 million years ago) to the Quaternary, with the presence of tuffs, ignimbrites, and volcano-sedimentary sequences. These rocks and geological structures, such as faults oriented mainly in a northwest-southeast (NW-SE) direction, facilitate the rise of heat and the circulation of fluids at deep levels. More than 120 water samples for chemical analysis were collected between 2022 and 2023. Based on chemical geothermometry, reservoir temperatures in Tutupaca could be as high as 200 °C. This makes the potential resource ideal for power generation. To complement the study, geophysical techniques such as magnetotellurics, gravimetry, and aeromagnetics were applied. Based on a Monte Carlo simulation, the potential size of the geothermal resource in Tutupaca was estimated to be between 59 to 181 MWe. Stored heat calculations yielded similar values. With these figures, the most conservative scenario would provide electricity to approximately 287,000 homes, while the medium scenario would reach more than 530,000, and the most optimistic could supply approximately 884,000 homes. This is equivalent to covering the electricity demand of the entire Tacna region several times over. Geothermal heating can also be explored, particular in the high Andean provinces like Candarave, where winter temperatures can drop to -10°C. Community heating, greenhouses, and thermal baths are just some of the possibilities. Tutupaca has [long been a site of geothermal development interest in Peru](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/history-of-geothermal-energy-research-in-peru-and-implications-for-the-future/), with early surveys dating back to the 1980’s. It was [one of several geothermal concessions in Peru](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/edc-and-alterra-power-sign-jv-agreement-for-projects-in-chile-and-peru/) that were explored by a joint venture of Philippine-based Energy Development Corporation (EDC) and Canadian Alterra Power Corp.

    "content": "Lithium producer and geothermal developer Cornish Lithium has secured another £35 million in equity funding, led by the UK's sovereign wealth fund. The new investment comprises £35m of equity funding, including up to £31m from the NWF. [This adds to the £53 million](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/cornish-lithium-receives-53m-investment-to-develop-domestic-lithium-supply/) that the NWF (then-known as the UK Infrastructure Bank) invested in Cornish Lithium back in 2023. The company’s long standing institutional investor, TechMet, has chosen to participate alongside NWF in this funding round. The funding is subject to various conditions including, _inter alia_ , shareholder approval at a General Meeting scheduled for 8 October 2025, sign off from the UK Takeover Panel and the relevant approvals being obtained under the National Security and Investment Act 2021. _“We are delighted to have the continued backing of NWF and TechMet, and to be able to offer our wider shareholder base the opportunity to invest alongside them. This funding marks an exciting step forward for Cornish Lithium as we move closer to construction decisions at our flagship projects,”_ said Jeremny Wrathall, Founder and Executive Chairman of Cornish Lithium. _“We have made significant progress since our last fundraising round and these new funds will enable Cornish Lithium to continue the journey towards securing a supply of lithium for UK industry and to support development of the domestic battery industry.”_ Founded in 2016, Cornish Lithium is an innovative mineral exploration and development company pioneering clean extraction of lithium in the UK. Earlier this year, the company secured planning consent for the Cross Lanes Geothermal Lithium Project, planned to be the UK’s first geothermal lithium production facility. The project will involve the drilling and testing of two production-scale geothermal wells drilled to around 2000 meters depth. The aim to extract lithium from the enriched brine while also harnessing heat for supply to local homes and businesses. Cornish Lithium is also working on the Trelavour Lithium Project which aims to produce 10,000 tonnes per year of battery-grade lithium hydroxide by rejuvenating and existing pit and through the use of a new process technology. In 2024, the company launched the first lithium hydroxide demonstration plant as part of the Trelavour project. The plant processes lithium-enriched granite from a former china clay pit to produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide.",

    "content": "Project InnerSpace has announced the Tapri geothermal cold storage project in Himachal Pradesh, India as the first project under the new GeoFund program. The Geothermal Exponential Opportunities Fund (GeoFund) is a program by Project InnerSpace that seeks to enable first-of-a-kind geothermal pilot projects that, if successful could be replicated on a global scale. It utilizes philanthropy to derisk geothermal pilots with potentially huge benefits to community and the economy, but cannot secure traditional forms of project financing. The village of Tapri in Himachal Pradesh is known for its apple orchards and horticultural produce. However, the lack of cold storage means that the harvest has to be sold quickly and often at low prices. The proposed cold storage facility will provide 500 tons of storage and fruit dehydration capacity, reducing waste and allowing farmers to sell their produce at premium prices. It also grants more stability to the revenue streams of the farmers while creating more local jobs. The Icelandic company Geotropy had previously also completed [a geothermal-powered drying facility for fruits and nuts](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/himachal-pradesh-india-to-set-up-geothermal-controlled-atmosphere-storage/) in the Kinnaur district. _“A widely recognized barrier to the rapid expansion of geothermal energy is the lack of pilot projects to demonstrate impact across the various technologies, applications, geologies, and geographies globally where it could be most impactful in economic development, energy security, and prosperity,”_ said Jamie Beard, Executive Director of Project InnerSpace. _“The Tapri pilot will tackle one of India’s most urgent agricultural challenges, lifting incomes, and proving a model to scale globally. We look forward to supporting the Geotropy team in the development of this pivotal project.”_ Project InnerSpace that applications similar to the Tapri pilot may be scalable to millions of hectares of cropland globally. To facilitate replicability, GeoFund will open source the project outcomes and other related data. Pilots addressing other applications of geothermal energy in Asia, Africa, and Central and South America are currently being considered for future founding rounds. **[RELATED: Project InnerSpace highlights India’s geothermal potential with GeoMap](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/project-innerspace-highlights-indias-geothermal-potential-with-geomap/)**",

Swiss power generation and distribution company [CKW AG](https://www.ckw.ch/) and [Localnet AG](https://www.localnet.ch/) have started work on initial investigation into a potential geothermal project in the city of Burgdorf in Switzerland. The focus on this phase will be preliminary investigations using publicly available subsurface data and heat utilization potential. If the Burgdorf region proves to be potentially suitable, the project partners will inform the public about the next steps in the geothermal energy assessment at a public event by the end of 2025. _“It is very important to me that the public is transparently informed about this project from the outset,”_ says Stefan Berger, Mayor of Burgdorf. _“However, it definitely makes sense to carefully examine the geothermal potential in our region. This also aligns with the goals of our ownership strategy of sustainable energy supply and long-term security of supply.”_ **Expertise from project partners** Each of the project partners, CKW and Localnet, contributes a complementary set of expertise to the geothermal investigation project. Localnet AG is the municipally owned energy supplier for Burgdorf and the surrounding area. As such, it understands the local conditions for infrastructure projects and is already connected to a base of water, telecommunications, heating, and water customers. This provides direct access to potential customers of a future geothermal heating facility. CKW, a subsidiary of the the energy company [Axpo Group](https://www.axpo.com/), is the largest energy supplier in the canton of Lucerne. It is currently working on a geothermal project in the Inwil municipality, for which it conducted[ a seismic exploration survey earlier this year](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/seismic-survey-for-geothermal-exploration-to-commence-in-lucerne-switzerland/).

    "content": "A magnitude 7.0 earthquake and a rare volcanic eruption struck Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, but geothermal power plants in the region remain unaffected. A series of significant geological events hit Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula this past week. On July 30th, a very powerful magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck off the Kamchatka coast, about 119 km east-southeast of the regional capital Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, as [widely reported internationally](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/huge-quake-russia-triggers-tsunami-warnings-around-pacific-2025-07-30/#:~:text=Russian%20scientists%20said%20the%20quake,Kamchatsky%2C%20a%20city%20of%20165%2C000). The earthquake – the largest in Kamchatka since 1952 – triggered [tsunami warnings across the Pacific](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/huge-quake-russia-triggers-tsunami-warnings-around-pacific-2025-07-30/#:~:text=July%2030%20%28Reuters%29%20,101%20on%20the%20peninsula), prompting evacuations as far as Japan, Hawaii, and even French Polynesia. While coastal flooding was reported in the Kuril Islands (with [waves up to 5 meters in Severo-Kurilsk](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/huge-quake-russia-triggers-tsunami-warnings-around-pacific-2025-07-30/#:~:text=crediting%20solid%20building%20construction%20and,smooth%20operation%20of%20alert%20systems)), Russian [officials noted](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/huge-quake-russia-triggers-tsunami-warnings-around-pacific-2025-07-30/#:~:text=,Yaroslav%2C%2025%2C%20in%20the%20city) the quake caused no casualties thanks to robust infrastructure and alert systems. In the quake’s aftermath, Kamchatka’s most active volcano, Klyuchevskoy, began erupting – [sending flows of lava down its slopes and explosions visible in the night sky.](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-klyuchevskoy-volcano-erupts-earthquake-evacuations-2106304) Scientists from the Russian Academy of Sciences observed that this volcanic activity, occurring roughly 450 km north of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, was likely triggered by the [massive tremors of the recent earthquakes](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/huge-quake-russia-triggers-tsunami-warnings-around-pacific-2025-07-30/#:~:text=The%20Klyuchevskoy%20volcano%20on%20Russia%27s,highest%20volcanoes%20in%20the%20world). Just a few days later, on August 3, another strong earthquake (magnitude 7.0) struck near the Kuril Islands at the southern tip of Kamchatka. Russia’s Ministry of Emergency Services briefly [issued a local tsunami warning for Kamchatka’s Pacific coast](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/europe/russia-volcano-eruption-earthquake-b2801054.html#:~:text=Another%20earthquake%20was%20recorded%20earlier,7%20struck%20Russia%27s%20Kuril%20Islands) as a precaution, advising residents to stay away from shores. However, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and the U.S. Geological Survey reported no significant tsunami threat from this quake, and the advisory was soon lifted. In the early hours following that quake, [the long-dormant Krasheninnikov Volcano in eastern Kamchatka erupted](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/03/europe/tsunami-russia-earthquake-volcano-intl-hnk) for the first time in approximately 600 years. Olga Girina, head of the Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team (KVERT), confirmed that no historical eruptions of Krasheninnikov [have been recorded since around the year 146](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/russia-cancels-tsunami-warning-kamchatka-after-quake-dormant-volcano-erupts-2025-08-03/#:~:text=,Eruption%20Response%20Team%2C%20as%20saying)0. The volcano’s sudden activity has been tentatively l[inked by scientists to the recent seismic upheavals](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/europe/russia-volcano-eruption-earthquake-b2801054.html#:~:text=According%20to%20RIA%2C%20Ms%20Girina,the%20earthquake%20recorded%20in%20Kamchatka). The eruption sent an [ash plume soaring about 6,000 meters into the sky](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/russia-cancels-tsunami-warning-kamchatka-after-quake-dormant-volcano-erupts-2025-08-03/#:~:text=The%20Kamchatka%20branch%20of%20Russia%27s,itself%20stands%20at%201%2C856%20metres). Fortunately, the ash cloud drifted eastward over the Pacific Ocean with **no populated areas along its path** , according to Kamchatka’s emergency services ministry. An “orange” aviation alert was i[ssued to warn aircraft of potential ash in the atmosphere](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/russia-cancels-tsunami-warning-kamchatka-after-quake-dormant-volcano-erupts-2025-08-03/#:~:text=The%20eruption%20of%20the%20volcano,to%20aircraft%2C%20the%20ministry%20said). Apart from heightened vigilance, authorities reported no injuries or damage from the eruption in this remote volcanic area. **Geothermal plants far from impact zone** _The Mutnovskaya 1 geothermal power plant (50 MW) in Kamchatka’s southern region. Despite recent tectonic and volcanic activity in Kamchatka, the peninsula’s geothermal power facilities have not been affected._ Kamchatka is home to three geothermal power plants operated by RusHydro, and importantly, these facilities are **not in close proximity** to the recent earthquake epicenter or erupting volcano. The plants are located in the southern and southwestern part of the peninsula, dozens of kilometers from the areas of volcanic activity. They include the following installations, according to ThinkGeoEnergy’s own research: * **Mutnovskaya 1** – 50 MW capacity * **Verkhne-Mutnovskaya** – 12 MW capacity * **Pauzhetskaya** – 12 MW capacity All three geothermal power stations are clustered south of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, whereas the July 30 quake and subsequent eruptions occurred far to the north and east. For example, the Mutnovskaya geothermal field is located about **60 km south** of Kamchatka’s capital city [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutnovskaya_Power_Station#:~:text=Mutnovskaya%20power%20station%20is%20a,1), near the Mutnovsky volcano plateau. In contrast, the active Klyuchevskoy volcano (which erupted after the large quake) lies roughly **450 km north** of Petropavlovsk. This geographic separation means the geothermal facilities did not experience the intense shaking or ash fall from those events. Officials have not reported any disruptions to the geothermal plants’ operations, and no evacuation or special measures were needed at the sites. In the case of Krasheninnikov’s eruption, its ash plume remained over uninhabited terrain and posed no threat to infrastructure. **Figure:** Kamchatka Peninsula in the context of the geothermal plants in the Asia-Pacific setting & the volcanoes (source: [ThinkGeoEnergy geothermal plant map](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/map/)) These observations underscore that Kamchatka’s geothermal power operations remain secure and **unaffected** by the recent natural events. A map illustrating the locations of the volcanoes and earthquake epicenter in relation to the geothermal plants would help visualize their wide geographic separation on the peninsula. (The planned map could pinpoint Krasheninnikov Volcano in the Kronotsky Nature Reserve, the offshore quake epicenter, and the Mutnovskaya/Pauzhetskaya geothermal sites in the south.) **Geothermal Operations and Ongoing Expansion** Not only have current geothermal operations continued without interruption, but Kamchatka is also moving forward with plans to expand its geothermal capacity. In late July, _RusHydro –_ the utility that owns all three existing geothermal plants – announced a new development initiative to boost renewable energy in the region. According to a recent RusHydro update, the company (through its local subsidiary Kamchatskenergo) has [**acquired a 51% stake** in Geothermal Energy LLC](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/rushydro-acquires-controlling-stake-of-geothermal-developer-in-kamchatka-russia/), a developer previously under Russian oil firm Zarubezhneft, as part of a partnership to build a second geothermal power station at Mutnovsky. The proposed **Mutnovskaya 2** plant will add **66.5 MW** of capacity in Kamchatka’s Mutnovsky geothermal area. This project also involves installing a new **16.5 MW binary unit** at the existing Mutnovskaya 1 power station to utilize additional heat from the field. Design and exploration work for Mutnovskaya 2 are expected to be completed by the end of 2027. Once operational, the expanded facilities will help meet growing electricity demand – a regional deficit of about 26–31 MW is projected by 2030 – and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. Crucially, the recent earthquake and volcanic eruption have not derailed these geothermal development plans. RusHydro has indicated that all geothermal plants continue to operate normally, and no adverse impacts have been observed at the project sites. The resilience of Kamchatka’s geothermal infrastructure amid seismic events highlights a key advantage of geothermal energy in this volcanically active region. Local authorities and plant operators will, of course, continue to monitor geologic activity, but as of now **geothermal power generation remains steady and secure**. **References:** * Reuters – _“Russia cancels tsunami warning for Kamchatka after quake, dormant volcano erupts”_ , Aug. 3, 2025 [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/russia-cancels-tsunami-warning-kamchatka-after-quake-dormant-volcano-erupts-2025-08-03/#:~:text=The%20Kamchatka%20branch%20of%20Russia%27s,itself%20stands%20at%201%2C856%20metres). * “Huge quake in Russia triggers tsunami warnings around Pacific”, July 31, 2025 [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/huge-quake-russia-triggers-tsunami-warnings-around-pacific-2025-07-30/#:~:text=July%2030%20%28Reuters%29%20,101%20on%20the%20peninsula),[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/huge-quake-russia-triggers-tsunami-warnings-around-pacific-2025-07-30/#:~:text=The%20Klyuchevskoy%20volcano%20on%20Russia%27s,highest%20volcanoes%20in%20the%20world). * ThinkGeoEnergy – _“RusHydro acquires controlling stake of geothermal developer in Kamchatka, Russia”_ , July 24, 2025 [thinkgeoenergy.com](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/rushydro-acquires-controlling-stake-of-geothermal-developer-in-kamchatka-russia/#:~:text=There%20are%20currently%20three%20geothermal,in%20Kamchatska%2C%20all%20under%20RusHydro), [thinkgeoenergy.com](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/rushydro-acquires-controlling-stake-of-geothermal-developer-in-kamchatka-russia/#:~:text=RusHydro%20has%20acquired%20majority%20stake,power%20plant%20in%20Kamchatka%2C%20Russia). * Wikipedia – _Mutnovskaya Power Station_ (accessed Aug. 2025) [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutnovskaya_Power_Station#:~:text=Mutnovskaya%20power%20station%20is%20a,1).

    "content": "The Onikobe geothermal power plant in Japan has started using a robotic quadruped, \"Spot,\" from Boston Dynamics for automated power plant inspection. In April 2023, J-Power [resumed operations of the Onikobe geothermal power plant](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/onikobe-geothermal-power-plant-in-osaki-japan-resumes-operation-after-six-years/) following a multi-year rehabilitation plan. At this facility, the control room that manages the power plant is separated from the plant itself, which meant that if an abnormality were to occur within the plant, it would take time for workers to get to the site to confirm the situation. As part of its initiative for smart safety practices through digital transformation, J-Power deployed Spot in 2022 to support operational activities at the Onikobe geothermal power plant by conducting automated data gathering around the power plant facilities. This has helped reduce workload, centralize the collection of large volumes of data, and ensure worker safety. As the video demonstrates, Spot is capable of thermographic analysis, acoustic analysis, and can convert gauge readings to digital data. Thus, it can detect thermal anomalies on equipment, unusual vibrations and noise on pumps and pipes, and upload all the data in a cloud-based server that can be accessed remotely. Spot can be automated to travel though pre-programmed routes and perform scheduled tasks. Hitoshi Nakatomi, Director of the Onikobe Geothermal Power Plant, recounted that the robotic unit was named “Onippy” by a first grade student from the local Onikobe Elementary School. Takashi Fuchi, Lead of the Spot program, added that they plan to further enhance the capabilities of the Spot unit so that it can be used for remote education and training.

    "content": "Two four-stage heat pumps are now being manufactured for the geothermal district heating project in Hamburg-Wilhelmsburg, Germany. The geothermal heating project in Hamburg-Wilhelmsburg is making steady progress, with the latest update now indicating that a customized heat pump system is being manufactured. The two four-stage heat pumps will have a combined output of 8 MW and a COP of up to 4.5 based on Saxony-based manufacturer WESKA Kälteanlagen GmbH. The geothermal heating project being developed by [Hamburg Energie Geothermie GmbH](https://www.geothermie-wilhelmsburg.de/), a subsidiary of Hamburger Energiewerke GmbH, d[rilled two wells successfully back in 2022](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/promising-initial-results-of-geothermal-exploration-drilling-in-hamburg-germany/). The results of productions tests announced in 2023 were promising, with thermal waters at 48 °C extracted from a depth of more than 1,300 meters. Over the following months, the developer worked intensively on pipeline construction for the heating distribution network. Using the heat pumps, the temperature of the water will be increased to the 75-85 °C needed by the district heating network. The multi-stage heat pumps operate with a natural refrigerant. Due to their design, they can be controlled very precisely to regulate the output and the required temperature. Thanks to the planned multi-stage heat pump process, the heat energy generated and thus the number of households supplied can be increased from the original 4,700 to over 6,000. _“We want to maximize the use of our geothermal heat. Our engineers and Weska have therefore designed a highly efficient and technologically advanced heat pump system,”_ explained Thomas-Tim Sävecke, Head of Engineering at Hamburger Energiewerke.",

    "content": "Join us for on 23 May 2025 for a webinar on geothermal well testing procedure utilizing downhole shutin to better measure true reservoir response. As part of the regular [Focus on Geothermal Webinar series](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/webinars) – a partnership of[ Enerchange](https://www.enerchange.de/) and ThinkGeoEnergy, we are proud to host Pieter Bruijnen of [EBN](https://www.ebn.nl/en/) for a webinar on**“Geothermal well testing – testing with a downhole shutin is a must.”** **Date:** 23 May 2025 **Time:** 14:00 CEST / 08:00 EST **Registration:**[Click here to register](https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/7168348967986860376) **Speaker:** Pieter Bruijnen, Reservoir/Production Engineer at EBN In geothermal wells, build-up phases of well tests are typically executed with a _surface_ shut-in, rather than with a _downhole_ shut-in. Therefore, wellbore physics may play a dominant, but highly undesirable, role in the system’s pressure response as recorded by the downhole pressure gauge. Significant portions of the Bourdet derivatives of geothermal well tests are expressions of these wellbore effects, rather than the reservoir’s pressure response. Due to their intensity and duration, they often (if not always…) overprint the true reservoir response, thereby making a reliable analysis of the reservoir characteristics impossible. In this webinar, numerical and analytical models show the consequences of not applying a downhole shutin while testing low-enthalpy geothermal wells. Although these simulations painfully expose the consequences and risks of wellbore physics, they cannot remove them. It is therefore strongly recommended to always execute a well test with a downhole shut-in, such that all wellbore effects are physically separated from the reservoir response. Only by doing so is the pressure recorded by the downhole gauge free of unwanted physical effects from the wellbore, allowing the reservoir parameters to be deduced with confidence. Pieter Bruijnen is a reservoir / production engineer at EBN in The Netherlands. At EBN he is involved in the development of the geothermal industry and in Underground Hydrogen Storage. Previously he worked as a petroleum engineer at TAQA Energy and as a reservoir engineer for SGS. Pieter’s interests include reservoir characterisation, reservoir and well performance, production optimisation, and system integration. Pieter holds an MSc degree in geology from Utrecht University in The Netherlands and an MSc degree in petroleum engineering from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, UK.

    "content": "The Kootenay Lake geothermal exploration project in BC, Canada is moving forward with a resistivity survey after securing a rural development grant. The[ South Kootenay Lake Community Services Society](https://cconnections.ca/) has received almost $100,000 in funding from the Rural Economic Diversification and Infrastructure Program (REDIP) to conduct electrical resistivity tomography surveys as part of exploration for geothermal energy in Kootenay Lake in British Columbia, Canada. The survey will be part of Phase 5 of the project, which will also include economic modeling and business planning for direct use applications. Earnest efforts to understand the potential geothermal system in Kootenay Lake have been ongoing for a few years. In 2022, a study done by [Geoscience BC](https://www.geosciencebc.com/) identified [the most viable area for geothermal development](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geoscience-bc-refines-model-of-kootenay-lake-geothermal-project-in-bc-canada/) in Kootenay Lake. This was determined to be on the east side of Kootenay Lake, in the area around Crawford Bay and in the territory of the Ktunaxa Nation. Further studies were done in the following years, with [a focus on the Crawford Creek Warm Spring in 2024](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geoscience-bc-study-reaffirms-geothermal-potential-in-kootenay-lake-bc-canada/) and detailed geological mapping and geochemical sampling (as part of Phase 4 of the project) done later in the same year. The findings from this phase point to a low temperature (40 °C) resource at shallow depths (2 to 3 km) hosted by a quartzite formation. The modeled recharge area combined with the projected depth of the quartzite suggest that there may be temperatures of 75 °C or higher at deeper sections. The results of the Phase 4 study were instrumental in pursuing plans for drilling a well in the Kootenay Lake study area to determine if there is sufficient temperature and flow rates for commercial use. The project aims to better understand the potential in the geothermal regions of the province of British Columbia, and possibly develop these assets for heat supply. It began as idea in 2019 and officially started in 2021.",

A geothermal production well has been drilled in the town of Dirang in Arunachal Pradesh, India. This marks the successful drilling of the first geothermal well in the Northeastern region of India which will soon supply much-needed reliable heating to the high-altitude region. The drilling operation was headed by the [Centre for Earth Sciences and Himalayan Studies](https://apceshs.org/) (CESHS), working under the Department of Science and Technology of Arunachal Pradesh. It represents the culmination of [two years of comprehensive geochemical and structural surveys](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-in-arunachal-pradesh-india-progresses-with-field-study/) of hot springs throughout western Arunachal Pradesh, as well as[ international collaborations](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/gsi-ceshs-sign-agreement-for-joint-geothermal-evaluation-of-arunachal-pradesh-india/) with the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute and Icelandic firm Geotropy ehf. Based on geochemical analysis, the well taps into a reservoir with a temperature of 115 °C. The project will initially supply heat for practical applications in the region, including drying facilities for fruit, nuts, and meat, as well as space heating systems and controlled atmosphere storage facilities. These facilities are expected to be operational soon. The goal of the project is to harness geothermal energy to improve the productivity of agricultural activities and improve living conditions. As the first concrete step towards realizing the geothermal potential in Northeastern India, the project will serve as a model for sustainable energy development in the mountainous and remote regions of the country.

    "content": "Geothermal well testing in Osijek, Croatia indicates resources above 100 °C, marking the second successful exploration site of the AZU in a four-site campaign. Testing and measurement of a newly drilled geothermal well in the city of Osijek in Croatia has determined a reservoir temperature of over 100 °C, while the estimated thermal output capacity is 5 MW. This confirms the presence of geothermal resources in Osijek with potential applications in district heating, agriculture, and other activities to boost the economy of the area. Drilling at Osijek [started earlier this year](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/site-preparation-ongoing-for-geothermal-drilling-in-osijek-croatia/) as part of a wider exploration campaign under the “Preparation and research of geothermal potential in the context of centralized heating” program. The [Croatian Hydrocarbon Agency](https://www.azu.hr/en-us) (Agencija za ugljikovodike / AZU) is heading the research with [Crosco – naftni servisi doo](https://crosco.com/), a member of the INA Group, as t[he drilling services provider](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/crosco-commissioned-for-geothermal-research-drilling-in-four-sites-in-croatia/). _“Osijek is a green leader among the largest Croatian cities, and this strategic project, worth more than EUR 8 million, which is financed through the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, has also confirmed Osijek’s great geothermal potential,”_ said Osijek Mayor Ivan Radic. _“Geothermal energy thus becomes a locally available and sustainable source of heating not only for our fellow citizens but also for the Osijek economy. Through this important project, Osijek continues its economic, but also green growth.”_ _“The expert team of the Hydrocarbons Agency and Crosco achieved the project goals with another positive result of the geothermal potential research. Geothermal energy is one of the most stable renewable sources, and with our research we confirm the great potential of the deposits in the Pannonian Basin and the strategic opportunity for long-term security of supply and decarbonization of the energy system,”_ added Marijan Krpan, President of the Management Board of the Hydrocarbons Agency. A few months ago, the AZU also announced promising results after drilling and testing [a geothermal well at the Velika Gorica site](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-resource-for-heating-confirmed-at-velika-gorica-croatia/), which was also part of the same exploration program. Meanwhile, further work is ongoing at the Vinkovci and [Zaprešic](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/permit-acquired-for-exploratory-geothermal-drilling-in-zapresic-croatia/) sites. Although reservoir temperatures in Osijek are lower than in Velika Gorica, owing to geological characteristics and a shallower reservoir, the geothermal resources are still flexible enough to be adapted to local needs. In any case, successful results in both Osijek and Velika Gorica strengthen the proposition that Croatia host diverse and valuable geothermal resources. The AZU states that the plan is to start drilling additional wells at locations with confirmed geothermal potential once exploration in all four sites has been completed. The goal would then be to establish production and reinjection well pairs in the sites so that exploitation of the resources can begin.",

    "date": "29 May 2025",
    "content": "Drilling of a geothermal well at the Budapest Airport in Hungary has started, a product of the country's licensing reforms to encourage geothermal growth. Drilling has started on the first geothermal well for the Liszt Ferenc International Airport, the international airport of Budapest, Hungary. If the project meets expectations, then geothermal can replace the natural gas heating currently being used in the Budapest Airport. _“As a responsible airport operator, we are convinced that urgent action and long-term, sustainable solutions are needed in the field of environmental protection,”_ said László Eiszrich, Deputy Chief Technical Officer of Budapest Airport. He added:_“If the exploratory drilling brings the expected results, it will be a huge step towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions from the airport’s direct activities by more than 90% by 2030 at the latest.”_ Drilling is being done by state-owned Rotaqua kft. The development of the geothermal heat supply system is being managed by Arctic Green Energy Terv Ktf. The geothermal heat project in the Budapest Airport is being implemented under the new licensing environment established by the [Hungarian Regulatory Authority](https://sztfh.hu/) (SZTFH). This [licensing reform](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-regulatory-framework-paving-the-way-for-geothermal-in-hungary/) was crucial in enabling increased interest in geothermal energy research within a short time, including in and around Budapest. In the past two years, the agency has received 123 geothermal research applications, of which 73 have already been approved. _“By exploiting its potential more intensively and building on the favorable conditions of the Carpathian Basin, geothermal energy can become a driving force for the Hungarian green economy,”_ said Attila Steiner, State Secretary for Energy. _“Thanks to the measures of the National Geothermal Utilization Concept adopted last year,[we can double domestic use by 2030.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/hungary-publishes-national-strategy-to-double-geothermal-output-by-2030/)“_ The State Secretary further emphasized that Hungary is already one of the leaders for geothermal in Europe, with systems operating in [Szeged](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/szeged-hungary-increases-geothermal-district-heating-capacity/), Gyoröt, [Miskolc](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/miskolc-district-heating-project-increase-revenues-for-pannergy/), Szentes and [Mosonmagyaróvár](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-heating-project-at-mosonmagyarovar-hungary-in-progress/), among other settlements. The Hungarian government is particularly supporting the spread of geothermal energy, and the largest sectoral modernization program in Hungary’s history, the Jedlik Ányos Energy Program, is also used to a significant extent for this. The total value of the applications for companies is more than 440 billion forints (approx. EUR 1.1 billion), and three out of ten calls specifically encourage geothermal investments. Dr. László Nagy, President of the SZTFH, stresses that the numbers indicate that geothermal is gaining momentum in Hungary, and that the country is successfully mobilizing its resources to develop this renewable resource.",

The**[International Geothermal Investment Summit](https://www.igis.com.tr/)** , which aims to align Turkey’s geothermal potential with sustainable development goals, will be held on May 9, 2025, at the Perissia Hotel & Convention Center in Ürgüp, Nevsehir. Organized by [JEMYAD](https://jemyad.org/) (Geothermal Energy and Mining Investors Association), the event sets out with the ambition of strengthening the role of geothermal resources in strategic sectors in line with Turkey’s 2053 net-zero emissions target. Of the four Priority Development Areas outlined in the 12th Development Plan for the 2024–2028 period, three—energy, agriculture and food, and tourism—directly correspond to the main application areas of geothermal resources. From this perspective, geothermal resource development has the potential to become a driving force of economic growth, particularly given Turkey’s substantial geothermal reserves. However, realizing this potential requires a revision of the regulatory framework, an improved investment climate, and the mobilization of financing mechanisms. If these conditions are met, geothermal development can: * Increase domestic and renewable energy production in support of the 2053 net-zero emissions goal, * Enhance food security and supply reliability through greenhouse-based agriculture, * Create a new area of tourism investment beyond saturated coastal destinations, contributing to the diversification of tourism and its expansion across the country year-round. In this context, the International Geothermal Investment Summit aims to bring together all public and private stakeholders to accelerate geothermal investments and strengthen their role in Turkey’s national development.

    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "17 Jun 2025",
    "content": "With the approval of canton authorities, the geothermal project in Haute-Sorne in Jura, Switzerland will proceed with stimulation tests starting July 2025. Approval has been granted to start the stimulation tests for the much-anticipated geothermal project in Haute-Sorne in the canton of Jura in Switzerland. Stimulation testing is scheduled to begin by the 7th of July. Stimulation tests will happen over one to two weeks, while the entire process is expected to take about a month and a half. The operations will conclude with the installation of seismic sensors in the well for long-term monitoring. Being developed by [Geo-Energie Jura AG](https://www.geo-energie-jura.ch/), drilling of a geothermal well to 4000 meters depth[ was completed at the Haute-Sorne site in August 2024](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/drilling-completed-for-first-well-of-haute-sorne-geothermal-project-switzerland/). The project is a major milestone for geothermal in the region, as it is the first well drilled in the Jura Arc, between Geneva and Basel, that completely penetrates the sediments and reaches the crystalline basement. A series of geophysical measurements had been completed since then to better understand the Jura geology. A leak test of the borehole had also been completed as part of the preparation for hydraulic stimulation. The authorization is issued following verification by the cantonal authorities, with the support of their experts, of Geo-Energie Jura’s detailed work program. The stimulation tests will be carried out in the exploratory well, at a depth of approximately 3,800 meters. The tests involve injecting water from the municipal network, in stages and without the addition of chemicals, sand or solids, up to a maximum flow rate of 60 L/min. A sophisticated seismic monitoring system will enable precise monitoring of the microseismicity deliberately induced by these operations. The seismograms will be published and available in near real time. The data will be available [on the Swiss Seismological Service (SED) website](http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/fr/monitoring/special-networks/geothermal-energy-haute-sorne/project-description/) during the stimulation phase. The operator’s work program provides for the temporary interruption of injections for analysis if the local magnitude reaches 0.3. Moreover, stimulation tests will end if the magnitude reaches 1.5. The local magnitude values will be determined independently and bindingly by the SED under [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). The latter will also be responsible for defining within 48 hours whether the earthquakes are induced by tests or are natural. Analysis of the results of the stimulation tests will be crucial in determining the future of the project. After analysis, the operator will transmit the results of the exploratory phase to the Canton of Jura, including an update of the risk analysis and the geological model. This data, as well as its integration into the general plan for the next phase, will allow the competent services to assess the compliance of the second stage of the project. The Independent Expert Group (GEI), mandated to provide scientific monitoring related to the risk of induced seismicity, will support this analysis and then formulate recommendations to the Government. Based on the assessment by the cantonal services and the recommendations of the GEI, the Government may then validate or not the continuation of the project, specifying, where applicable, the authorization framework. As long as an authorization condition is not respected or if the risk level is not acceptable, the continuation of the project will not be authorized. **[RELATED: Positive conclusions on Haute-Sorne geothermal project reported by federal committee](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/positive-conclusions-on-haute-sorne-geothermal-project-reported-by-federal-committee/)**",

The project is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy. The project will involve an initial seismic campaign that seeks to expand the network of existing geothermal energy plants in the entire permit area. The most favorable locations for new geothermal facilities will also be identified. It paves the way for the regional heat transition, away from fossil fuels and toward a locally produced, climate-neutral, secure, and affordable heat supply. The joint research project also represents the realization that the goal of intensive, sustainable use of this enormous potential can only be achieved through a collaborative and coordinated approach by research and science, as well as the city and municipalities in the region. The following are responsible for carrying out measurements and the approval process: * DMT GmbH & Co. KG (technical implementation of the 3D seismic measurements) * IPS Informations & Planungsservice GmbH (coordination of the permitting process and communication with property owners) The project consortium will provide accompanying information for municipalities and the public in the coming weeks and months.

    "date": "28 Jul 2025",
    "content": "The proposal of a geothermal discovery insurance fund is once again being discussed by German lawmakers after initial efforts were stymied by external factors. The proposal for a discovery insurance for geothermal projects in Germany is now back on the agenda of lawmakers, as discussed in a recent federal budget debate. A sum of EUR 50 million has been earmarked for this as commitment appropriations over the next four years. The proposal for a risk protection mechanism [was first announced as a joint loan programme](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/kfw-munich-re-introduce-risk-protection-mechanism-for-geothermal-in-germany/) of federal development bank [KfW](https://www.kfw.de/kfw.de-2.html) and insurance company [Munich Re](https://www.munichre.com/en.html) during last year’s Praxisforum Geothermie Bayern held in Pullach. Although the insurance had already been fully developed and coordinated for a launch in January 2025, it had to be suspended due to the early end of the legislative period of the previous coalition government. According to the [German Geothermal Association](https://www.geothermie.de/aktuelles/nachrichten) (BVG), the current draft budget for the insurance totals almost EUR 50 million. This is intended to cover a total of 65 projects over the next four years, with an investment volume of EUR 2 to 3 billion. Matthias Tönnis of Munich Re emphasizes the need for an insurance scheme to protect municipalities from the cost of failed geothermal drilling. _“By the time the first well is drilled, a municipality can incur upfront costs of 20 to 30 million euros,”_ explains Tönnis._“If the drilling doesn’t deliver what it expected, the money is gone.”_ The proposal of a geothermal discovery insurance fund addresses one of the major hurdles of geothermal development in Germany. This complements well with current efforts to expedite approvals and other bureaucratic processes, as proposed by The Geothermal Energy Acceleration Act (GeoBG). [A draft of this act has just been published](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/germany-publishes-new-draft-for-proposed-geothermal-energy-acceleration-act/) by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs.",

    "content": "The latest expansion of Project InnerSpace's GeoMap tool highlights the huge further potential for geothermal development in Australia and New Zealand. GeoMap™ Oceania uses millions of datapoints on heat flow, thermal gradients, temperature at depth, and heat-in-place volumes, alongside surface characteristics such as demand centers, industrial clusters, and access to transmission and other infrastructure, to identify where today’s drilling technologies can access geothermal heat for electricity, industrial heat, and district cooling. GeoMap also highlights locations for [geothermal powered and cooled data centers](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-ppas-gain-ground-with-data-center-demand/), industrial clusters that are candidates for geothermal heat conversion, coal plants that are candidates for geothermal power conversion, and locations that have subsurface energy storage potential, providing actionable insights for policymakers and project developers. As a follow on to this data release, a “Future of Geothermal in Oceania” report is in the early stages of development, which will function as a roadmap for tapping the region’s full geothermal potential, and consider topics such as investment pathways, supportive policy recommendations, strategies to accelerate development, and high impact pilot projects. In New Zealand, conventional geothermal is already a major energy source given its position on a tectonic boundary, and GeoMap™ identifies significant additional opportunities for [next-generation geothermal development](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-zealand-launches-draft-action-plan-to-double-geothermal-energy-use-by-2040/) there. Australia is a vast and untapped frontier for geothermal, with GeoMap™ showing opportunities for next-generation geothermal electricity and industrial heat despite the fact that it lacks New Zealand’s volcanic resources. Australia is also home to some of the world’s largest and hottest sedimentary basins, which are an excellent resource for district cooling in major cities like Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide. _“Until GeoMap, there was no easily accessible tool to help stakeholders understand and quantify the geothermal resources beneath them, and thus this ubiquitous resource has been overlooked,”_ said Jamie Beard, Executive Director of Project InnerSpace._“ Australia is an excellent example of untapped potential – with 10X total energy demand hidden beneath the surface, and few indications on the surface that it is there. It is our hope that GeoMap will support stakeholders in advancing this massive but invisible potential into ‘wells in the ground’ development.”_",

    "content": "The Indian Army has inaugurated a Geothermal-Based Net Zero Building at Jhansi, with a shallow geothermal borehole field for space air conditioning. A Geothermal-Based Net Zero Building has been inaugurated at the city of Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh, India. An array of ten boreholes, drilled to a depth of 120 meters each, provides space air conditioning to the building, thus far being able to maintain indoor temperatures of 22 °C while the outdoor temperature is at 43 °C. The building, designed and built for the Indian Army at CWE Jhansi, was built from the ground up to demonstrate the feasibility and benefit of net-zero technologies. The electricity supply of the building is primarily from photovoltaic panels, with a backup grid connection when solar power is not available. The ground source heat pump system is the only source of air conditioning. The project was commissioned by the Military Engineering Service of the Indian Army, seeking to build a facility with an Energy Performance Index (EPI) of less than 50. For location, buildings in the city of Jhansi have a standard recommended EPI of 144. The building was designed and delivered by [S.A.P. Automations India Pvt Ltd](https://www.lowenergy.in/), the same company that designed [the large-scale geothermal heating and cooling system at the Leh Airport. ](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/leh-airport-set-to-have-indias-largest-geothermal-space-conditioning-system/) The project took 138 days to complete. Reports indicate that the Indian Army now intends to replicate this technology for facilities in higher altitudes. _“This is a big success in India’s journey of Net Zero buildings , be it cooling or heating. Our grid is essentially coal-dominated and geothermal can not only give solutions for low-energy buildings but also decarbonized space conditioning,”_ said Arijit Ghosh, Managing Director at S.A.P. Automations India. _“The Indian Army is a large consumer of space conditioning. Hence, I would think it’s a potential game-changer not just for the Army, but for India.”_",

    "content": "Baseload Capital has made a strategic investment in Japanese developer Furusato Netsuden, empowering a community-centric model for development. Swedish company [Baseload Capital](https://www.baseloadcap.com/) has announced a strategic investment in Japanese geothermal energy developer [Furusato Netsuden](https://furusato-nd.co.jp/). The partnership aims to unlock Japan’s untapped geothermal potential and build a replicable model for sustainable energy development worldwide. Combining a global investment portfolio with a community-rooted business model, this strategic partnership aims to scale clean, renewable energy respectfully, revitalizing local economies while honoring cultural heritage. The investment is made through Baseload Furusato, a wholly owned subsidiary of Baseload Capital that is headquartered in Minato Ward, Tokyo. Furusato Netsuden brings deep local roots, trust, and operational expertise to the partnership, while Baseload Capital contributes international investment, global reach, and the power of committed owners such as Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures. Japan has the third largest geothermal potential globally, with an estimated 23 GW, yet its current installed capacity is only 576 MW. This represents a major untapped opportunity for a country whose Green Transformation (GX) Strategy aims for net-zero emissions by 2050. Geothermal energy is clean, always-on, and space-efficient. That makes it an ideal solution for a mountainous, densely populated nation with high reliance on energy imports and growing clean-energy demand from AI and data centers. Japan’s geothermal development has been slow, in part, because there’s no common business model that enables communities to share in the benefits. However, Furusato Netsuden and its local partners have developed a system to ensure communities benefit directly from geothermal energy. In 2011, residents of the Waita area in Oguni Town, Kumamoto Prefecture, formed the limited liability company Waita-kai, which is owned by the community. In partnership with Furusato Netsuden, they set out to develop geothermal power together [in a way that would revitalize the community](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/waita-japan-geothermal-development-in-harmony-with-onsen-operations/). The name Furusato Netsuden combines the words for “hometown”, “heat” and “electricity”. The [“Waita model”](https://furusato-nd.co.jp/about/waita-model/) is a model that positions geothermal energy as “local / regional heat,” rather than an “underground resource.” Thus, development is primarily led by the local communities rather than companies. Even in geothermal development areas in New Zealand, there have been cases where methods that benefit local vested interests, such as Maori trusts, have been adopted, ultimately accelerating geothermal power generation development in the short term. The same model is being applied for geothermal development ongoing in Oguni Town, Aso District, Kumamoto Prefecture, the Teshikaga area of Hokkaido, and other hot spring areas. This model protects local land rights, ensures development is carried out on a scale appropriate for the area, and guarantees some of the revenues are re-invested in the community. Furusato Netsuden and Waita-kai regularly hold meetings with residents to share updates on operations, development, and environmental monitoring. * In 2015, the 2 MW capacity Waita No. 1 geothermal power plant began commercial operation. * Waita No. 2, [currently under construction](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/construction-starts-on-waita-no-2-geothermal-power-plant-kumamoto-japan/), is expected to deliver 5 MW and go online in March 2026. * In addition to the 7 MW currently operating or under construction in Waita, the overall portfolio includes a tangible pipeline of projects across Japan that are expected to deliver an additional 30+ MW over the next five to ten years. _“Furusato Netsuden has successfully proven that community-based geothermal development works. Through this first investment, we’re proud and humbled to partner with them in scaling this approach, combining local engagement with sustainable energy development. Together, we aim to help Japan reach its 1.5 GW geothermal goal and strengthen national energy resilience,”_ said Alexander Helling, CEO of Baseload Capital. _“Since 2020, we’ve built a foundation of trust with Baseload Capital, and seen that they are a committed, long-term partner in Japan’s energy transition. Their role as a strategic investor provides financial stability for our current and future projects. They also bring valuable global resources, including technology, business insights and an international network of investors and energy partners,”_ added Kazuyuki Akaishi, Representative Director of Furusato Netsuden. The goal of this partnership is to support Japan’s 7th Strategic Energy Plan and GX (Green Transformation) while establishing a scalable, community-focused blueprint for clean energy development – creating global impact with local roots.",

The first commercial mine water heat scheme in Wales in the UK has started operations, supplying clean and stable heat to an industrial facility near Ammanford. The project is part of the work commissioned by the Welsh government to map areas of Wales most suited for mine water heat schemes. The Mining Remediation Authority operates the Lindsay treatment scheme where an average of 25 liters of mine water per second is treated to remove about 28 kilograms of iron per day. This prevents the mine water from contaminating the local watercourses, including the Ffrwd Brook which flows into the River Loughor. This is important work in ensuring that aquatic ecosystems are maintained clean and healthy. The Lindsay operation has been ongoing since 2018. The mine water is naturally warm due to geothermal energy heating the water in former coal mines. Working in collaboration with local business Thermal Earth Ltd, the renewable heat project secured funding through Innovate UK’s New Innovators in Net Zero Industry, South West Wales initiative. The system works by using heat exchangers submerged in one of the settlement ponds at the Lindsay scheme to recover heat from mine water, which is then transferred to a nearby industrial unit to supply low-carbon heating and hot water, and is predicted to save 17.5 tonnes of CO2 per year. The new development in Wales follows the successful implementation of [a mine water heating scheme in Gateshead](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/gateshead-uk-mine-water-geothermal-heating-scheme-hailed-a-success/) which started operations back in 2023. _“It’s been incredibly rewarding to see this forward-thinking project, transforming part of our mining legacy into a source of clean, renewable heat,”_ said Andrew Simpson, head of Innovation, By-Products and Services at the Mining Remediation Authority. _“It’s a powerful example of how innovation, collaboration and technical expertise can work together to deliver real-world solutions to the climate challenge.”_ A short video on the Wales mine water heating and treatment scheme can be seen below: ??",

    "title": "Can geothermal development in Jinlun, Taiwan co-exist with tribal communities?",
    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "30 Apr 2025",
    "content": "As geothermal development in Taiwan builds momentum, issues related to community acceptance have to be addressed early on, such as in the Jinlun region. With at least four geothermal projects in various stages of development, the village of Jinlun has emerged as one of the rising stars for Taiwan’s geothermal sector. However, local tribal communities have not fully embraced the onset of geothermal development in this area. Thus, efforts are underway for a more fair and inclusive energy transformation in Jinlun, which can have cascading effects for other geothermal projects in Taiwan. Located at the mouth of Jinlun River, the village of Jinlun has a well-established and thriving tourism industry. The Jinlun Wild Creek Hot Spring, located under the visually distinct Jinlun Rainbow Bridge, attracts tourists and outdoor enthusiasts all year long. It has also been a bathing place for the Paiwan people, a local tribe. Hot spring hotels are everywhere in Jinlun, and many of these are adorned with indigenous totems and decorations. When the Quanyang geothermal power project was first proposed, the Jinlun Village Chief Chen Zhiwei noted that the villagers already had a negative attitude towards it. In 2022, groundwater levels in Jinlun rapidly dropped by almost 10 meters. Local hot spring operators ascribed this to the drilling operations that were happening at the time, although it was proven that it was caused by a shallow earthquake. Although the dispute has ended, the negative attitude of the residents towards geothermal operators remains difficult to remedy. This is an issue that needs to be addressed, especially since the Quanyang geothermal power plant is working on a 500-kW expansion of its facilities. Upstream of the Jinlun River are also geothermal sites being developed including Huantai, Taiyi Honglun, and Jiuli. Earlier this year, members of the tribal groups took the initiative to establish a “Geothermal Communications Platform” so that their representatives can be represented in plans and negotiations for geothermal development. The aspiration is for the tribes to sit at the same table as the developers, the National Energy Agency, and the national and city government for a peaceful and continuous dialogue An event was held in January 2025 to provide an initial forum for this type of conversation. The “Taiwan Aboriginal Peoples and Geothermal Forum” was attended by members of the tribal groups and other stakeholders. Pastor Uduf Lebak of the Tayal National Council sang a prayer that signified that all hostility must be put aside so that all sides participate in a productive and peaceful discussion. _“Even though we are different ethnic groups, we will call each other the life community of the Jinlun River Basin,”_ added Chen Zhiwei, the convener of the Jinlun River Basin Alliance. Wang Shou-chen of the Taiwan Geothermal Association further gave recommendations on how members of the community can be empowered to be part of geothermal development. He proposed that developers train the local people to become citizen scientists and participate in environmental monitoring. Thus, they will be given active roles in managing the underground resource and maintaining the existing geothermal tourism sector. Taiwan has clearly built a healthy momentum in geothermal development, particularly with [the recent signing of a 10-MW geothermal PPA with Google](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/google-baseload-capital-ink-geothermal-ppa-in-taiwan/) for power supply to their data centers. It is prudent for the national geothermal sector to avoid and address pitfalls like lack of community acceptance for geothermal projects so that the momentum may continue, and such issues do not become magnified in future projects.",

The Appi geothermal power plant is newer, having just started commercial operations last year. Aside from schools, geothermal power is now supplied to 78 facilities in Hachimantai including the City Hall and local businesses, such as the Hachimantai Resort. The combined capacity of the two power plants is equivalent to the electricity needs of about 40,000 households. In line with promoting the benefits of geothermal energy, the city of Hachimantai runs a “Geothermal Exploration Team” program every year. This allows childen to learn more about geothermal energy by visiting geothermal facilities and the industries that rely on geothermal power. As Kashiwadai Elementary School principal Atsushi Yamamura says, _“Just using electricity makes it difficult for children to see geothermal energy as a local asset. By smelling the hot springs and actually learning about jobs that rely on geothermal power, the children have an opportunity to cherish their hometown as a ‘geothermal town.'”_",

The [Joint State Government Commission](https://www.jsg.legis.state.pa.us/) of the State of Pennsylvania has published a report that examines the applicability of different geothermal technologies to develop the resources in Pennsylvania and citing potential opportunities in abandoned mine water facilities and oil and gas wells. The report also recommends further actions for state agencies, policy makers, and education and advocacy bodies. The report was prepared in response to [House Resolution 185 of 2023,](https://www.palegis.us/legislation/bills/2023/hr185) as requested by Rep. Joe Webster (D-Montgomery). The Joint State Government Commission is the primary non-partisan research organization of Pennsylvania, providing legislature with a readily available mechanism for conducting interdisciplinary studies. [Click here to read the full report: **“Unearthing the Potential of Geothermal Energy Systems in Pennsylvania.”**](https://www.jsg.legis.state.pa.us/publications.cfm?JSPU_PUBLN_ID=570) Among the findings of the report is the identification of 388 potential geothermal sites near mine water sources in the Commonwealth. However, further modeling by the Bureau of Ecological Survey is recommended to increase the adoption of such systems. Furthermore, a regulatory framework needs to be established to provide a process for review and approval of such projects. The report emphasizes the importance of using geothermal for heat, particularly couple with heat pumps. This technology is efficient and highly scalable. A major challenge is the lack of distribution infrastructure that will allow for large-scale geothermal heat pump networks, thus making such projects more capital-intensive. The goal is then to utilize thermal water from flooded mines to reduce the cost of building geothermal systems. Interestingly enough, this is already the second extensive report to come out this year on the geothermal potential of Pennsylvania.[ In February 2025](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/project-innerspace-publishes-future-of-geothermal-in-pennsylvania-report/), [Project InnerSpace](https://www.projectinnerspace.org/), in collaboration with [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) published “The Future of Geothermal in Pennsylvania” which highlights opportunities for geothermal use for the state’s residential, commercial, agricultural, manufacturing and pharmaceutical sectors.",

It is expected that as many as 19 geothermal projects, with a total capacity of 530 MW, will be accelerated through operational synergy and cross-entity coordination. As outlined in the Heads of Agreement, the two parties will work together specifically on the 30-MW Ulubelu Bottoming Unit in Lampung and the 15-MW Lahendong Bottoming Unit in North Sulawesi. These two projects are considered part of a “quick-win” strategy enabling PGEO to reach 1GW installed capacity by 2030. Moreover, the scope of work includes formulating partnership schemes, utilizing geothermal working areas (WKP) owned by each part, aligning of project implementation plans, and implementing technical and commercial feasibility studies. PGEO and PLN IP have also been tasked to establish a Joint Working Team and a Joint Committee. Cooperation between the two parties is considered an integral part of Indonesia’s national strategy for developing a strong, sustainable, and domestic-sourced energy system. _“Through this partnership, we are exploring collaborative schemes that will allow for the measurable and progressive optimization of geothermal potential,”_ said Simon Aloysius Mantiri, President Director of PT Pertamina (Persero). “ _Together with PLN and Danantara Indonesia, we are ready to accelerate the implementation of strategic projects that directly contribute to the national energy transition target and increase the renewable energy mix.”_ Just a few weeks ago, PGEO announced[ the start of commercial operations of the 55-MW Lumut Balai Unit 2](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/lumut-balai-unit-2-geothermal-power-plant-in-indonesia-now-fully-operational/) geothermal power plant in South Sumatra. PT Danantara Asset Management is the operational holding of [Danantara Indonesia](https://www.danantaraindonesia.com/) (Daya Anagata Nusantara Investment Management Agency), a sovereign wealth fund launched earlier this year. The purpose of Danantara is to act as an investment vehicle to increase the global competitiveness of Indonesia’s state-owned enterprises (SOE). The fund was created via an amendment to Law No. 19/2003 on State-Owned Enterprises that seeks to make SOEs more efficient, transparant, and globally competitive while ensuring their contribution to Indonesia’s economic growth. With an initial capital of $61 billion, Danantara aims to finance major infrastructure projects and enhance SOE profitability. The initial strategy involves the takeover of the management of both PT Pertamina and PT PLN, as well as financial institutions, and mining and telecommunications companies. _“We are committed to ensuring that every strategic asset management initiative is carried out with accountable, professional, and in line with international standards_ ,” commented Rosan Roeslani, CEO of Danantara Indonesia.",

There are [three more geothermal power facilities](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/edc-set-to-put-four-geothermal-power-facilities-online-in-2024/) that are expected to be operational soon – the 20-MW Tanawon plant, the 5.6-MW Bago binary power plant, and the 28-MW Mahanagdong plant. COO and President Jerome Cainglet has provided valuable updates on the status of these projects. The Tanawon plant has already been synchronized to the grid while the testing and commissioning of the Mahanagdong plant is ongoing. Meanwhile, mechanical completion of the Bago binary power plant was achieved in late 2024. The company has also announced plans of augmenting their geothermal power facilities with Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). These facilities are expected to be implemented in the Bacman, Tongonon, and Negros fields.",

    "content": "Exploratory geothermal drilling has been approved by the Government of Canary Islands on four sites in the southern part of Tenerife. The [Governing Council of the Canary Islands](https://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/principal/) has approved the start of geothermal resource exploration surveys on the island of Tenerife, particularly for a number of sites that were tendered back in 2021. The main goal for this project would be to assess geothermal potential for the sites, located in the southern part of Tenerife, through exploratory drilling, and thus assessing the feasibility of geothermal electricity generation. The “TF-Sur Soundings” project will involve four mining grids assigned in the tender. The Tahatan and Tikahit sites have been assigned to commercial entity Energia Geotermica de Canarias, while two sites in Barranco Hondo will be managed by the Technological Institute and Renewable Energies ([Instituto Tecnológico y Energías Renovables](https://www.iter.es/) / ITER). The licenses were awarded to these two companies [back in 2024](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-exploration-contracts-in-canary-islands-awarded-to-nine-entities/). Salient to the approval is the decision to exclude the “TF-Sur Soundings” project from the simplified environmental impact assessment procedure. This was done to comply with European regulations that establish a timeframe to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy in Europe. None of the surveys planned are located within natural areas belonging to the Canary Islands Network of Protected Natural Areas or the Natura 2000 Network, which justifies the decision. The council decided that initiating such a process could cause a delay that would be more environmentally damaging than the planned research activity itself. Furthermore, the project has been evaluated and validated by specialized technical personnel from the Canary Islands Government and the Tenerife Island Council. The government will implement all environmental monitoring protocols throughout its execution to ensure compatibility with the environment, as this project represents a real opportunity to move toward a cleaner, more renewable, and more indigenous energy model. Once the operation is complete and the drilling equipment is dismantled, the ground will be restored to its original state, ensuring no permanent environmental impact in the affected areas. The excavations will also be backfilled and leveled with the material accumulated in the nearby stockpile area.",

The [Ministry of Economic Affairs](https://www.moea.gov.tw/) (MOEA) of Taiwan, through the Geological and Survey Mining Administration, has partnered with the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) and De’An Aviation to introduce MobileMT, an airbone magnetotelluric (MT) survey program for geothermal exploration. The airborne survey will operate from 6-12 August and will concentrate on the Sanxing and Datong townships in Yilan County. The middle and upper regions of the Lanyang River in Yilan County are considered to have the highest deep geothermal potential among Taiwan’s ten major geothermal areas. For this reason, the survey will focus on this area in hopes that the advanced technology will create a breakthrough in geological research, particularly in the exploration of geothermal resources. The survey will work by suspending the MT instrument on a helicopter, which will then fly at relatively lower altitudes (approximately several hundred meters). The method can help acquire subsurface resistivity data over a wide area rapidly, thus helping to map out the highly permeable structures or formations rich in conductive minerals. In the future, the results of the survey will be publicly available on the Geothermal Exploration Information Platform website. This survey involves a team of geothermal exploration and geophysical experts from Canada, who have extensive experience conducting helicopter-based surveys worldwide. The Mineral Resources and Earth Science Center has assured all residents in the survey area that all flights and survey operations are to be carried out in accordance with standard procedures and have been approved by the relevant authorities. **[RELATED: Industry players officially establish Taiwan Geothermal Industry Association](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/industry-players-officially-establish-taiwan-geothermal-industry-association/)**",

The state capital of Hanover in Lower Saxony, Germany has provided a municipal site in Lahe, at the corner of Kirchhorster Straße and Alte Peiner Heerstraße, under a long-term leasehold agreement to a planned geothermal heating project using the pioneering closed-loop technology of[ Eavor Technologies.](https://eavor.de/) With a target capacity of 30 MW, the project is expected to start supplying to the heating network by 2027. The system will draw heat from a depth of approximately 3200 meters using the so-called Eavor-Loop™ system. Eavor’s closed system operates without access to natural hot water reservoirs. Instead, a water-based medium circulates through kilometers of deep boreholes – powered solely by the so-called thermosiphon effect. Heat is absorbed from the surrounding rock through thermal conduction and transported to the surface. Eavor is already [at the advanced stages of developing a similar system at the Gerestried site](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/eavor-receives-130m-in-financing-geretsried-geothermal-germany/), where the company is targeting the first commercial deployment of the technology later this year. Two of these systems, each with a capacity of 15 MW, are planned for the Hannover-Lahe site. They are expected to supply approximately 250 million kWh per year, enough to heat up to 20,000 households and cover up to 20% of Hanover’s district heating needs. In 2023, Eavor s[igned a heat supply agreement](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/eavor-signs-geothermal-heat-supply-contract-in-hanover-germany/) with regional utility enercity. _“Hanover is a pioneer, as it is the first plant of its kind in a major city. With this, we want to make rural, climate-friendly geothermal energy suitable for urban use and also offer a blueprint for other cities. This project is a decisive step toward converting the state capital’s district heating supply to renewable and independent energy. The innovative approach will generate interest in the solution beyond our borders,”_ said Hanover’s Mayor Belit Onay. _“Our goal is to supply cities with renewable and reliable energy using scalable deep geothermal energy – entirely without emissions, fracking, or thermal sources. Hanover is the first major city in Germany where we are permitted to implement this technology – and we are very grateful to the state capital and enercity for this,”_ says Marco Becker, Managing Director of Eavor GmbH. _“Following our first project in Geretsried, this is a milestone for our company and a clear sign of the transformation of heat supply.”_ The project partners will soon be presenting at a public session of the Bothfeld-Vahrenheide District Council. This will be followed by a presentation at the Geothermal Energy Day at the State Office for Mining, Energy and Geology (Stilleweg).",

The [Marshland Primary Academy](https://marshlandprimaryacademy.org.uk/), a primary school located in the village of Moorends in South Yorkshire, has just completed the installation of a hybrid geothermal and solar system. The system now secures the heating supply for the school, while massively boosting the facility’s energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions by almost 80%. The six-month project was partially funded by the UK Government’s Condition Improvement Fund, which seeks to keep school buildings safe and in good working order. Working with ground source heat pump manufacturer and installer [Kensa](https://kensa.co.uk/), the school has overhauled its old heating and hot water system and replaced its aging gas boilers with seven new ground source heat pumps. Geothermal heat is supplied to these heat pumps by a field of 18 boreholes, each drilled to a depth of around 127 meters. Another key component of the system is the use of solar photovoltaic thermal (PVT) panels, which captures excess thermal energy while also generating electricity from solar energy. The thermal heat energy is removed by the PVT panels and transferred to the [ground source heat pump](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/us-doe-publishes-series-of-geothermal-heat-pump-case-studies/) system, further reducing electricity use and improving efficiency. The removal of excess thermal heat from the panels also increases the amount of electricity they can produce compared to standard solar PV panels. _“We’re proud to have worked with Marshland Primary Academy to deliver a more sustainable and efficient heating system. Thanks to a mix of super-efficient ground source heat pumps and other energy efficiency upgrades, pupils and teachers will enjoy warm classrooms while slashing their carbon footprint,”_ added Wouter Thijssen, Commercial Director at Kensa. _“By opting for ground source heat pumps, boosted by solar PVT, the school has secured its long-term energy future, setting the benchmark for achieving sustainability in UK schools. Kensa’s mission is to deliver better heating, and this installation certainly lives up to that promise.”_ Kensa has been active in installing ground source heat pump systems in other schools in the UK, including the Stamfordham Primary School in Northumberland, the Ffynnon Taf Primary School in South Wales, and the Richmond Hill Primary School in Doncaster. Investing in energy efficiency upgrades has provided the Marshland Primary Academy with a low-cost, low-maintenance, renewable heating system, providing long-term savings while securing a stable and reliable energy source. _“It has been an exciting journey watching and learning about the innovative ground source heating. Although the children had to sacrifice their field for the summer, they enjoyed watching the holes being bored and learning from Kensa staff how the system worked,”_ said Penny Marshall, Acting Principal at Marshland Primary Academy. _“Energy efficiency and helping the environment is a big focus at Marshland, so it is exciting to be able to know that we are playing a small part in a much bigger picture by using natural resources to heat our school.

    "content": "Geothermal exploration gains momentum in Hawaii, as new state-funded studies and industry efforts aim to expand renewable baseload energy across the islands. According to a recent report by the Hawaii Tribune-Herald, the Hawaii State Energy Office is funding an effort to produce updated geothermal resource maps for multiple islands, including Hawaii Island, Maui, and Lanai. The data is expected to help reduce drilling risk and cost, as well as to improve investment confidence in new geothermal projects. The initiative is part of a broader push to diversify Hawaii’s clean energy portfolio and reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels. While Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) currently remains the only operational geothermal power plant in the state, producing up to 38 MW on Hawaii Island, other regions are being evaluated for new development opportunities. The administration is seeking support for around USD 80 million in funding for the next two years, with more likely later. **Aiming for energy resilience** Hawaii has set ambitious climate and energy goals, including achieving 100% renewable electricity by 2045. Geothermal energy – thanks to its firm, baseload nature – is viewed as a vital contributor to energy security, grid stability, and long-term sustainability. In addition to the state-led mapping program, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is undertaking its own geothermal resource assessment across the islands. These layered efforts are meant to overcome historical uncertainties around subsurface temperatures, permeability, and other geological factors that have long limited development. “There is enormous geothermal potential across Hawaii,” said State Energy Officer Mark Glick, who emphasized that improved resource data will help identify promising sites and streamline permitting processes. **Private sector readiness** Interest from private developers is also increasing. Ormat Technologies, owner and [operator of PGV](https://punageothermalproject.com/), has stated its intent to expand operations on the Big Island, while other firms are reportedly evaluating prospects on Maui and Lanai. The state’s only geothermal plant, PGV, [resumed operations in 2020](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/ormat-resumes-operation-of-the-puna-geothermal-power-plant-on-hawaii/) after a prolonged shutdown due to the 2018 eruption of Kilauea Volcano. The facility now plays a critical role in Hawaii Island’s grid and serves as a model for how geothermal can contribute to both climate targets and energy reliability. **For the geothermal sector** The recent developments in Hawaii reflect a renewed commitment to advancing geothermal as a strategic, low-emission power source. By combining public sector mapping and de-risking efforts with private investment and community engagement, the state is creating a more fertile ground for future projects. As island grids globally look for firm and clean alternatives to fossil fuels, Hawaii’s geothermal journey may offer valuable insights for other volcanic regions seeking to harness their underground heat.",

The Tunu project is a unique opportunity, combining primary helium and geothermal energy potential in a highly strategic location. This Pre-Feasibility Study could be a crucial step in unlocking additional value for our shareholders and support Europe’s critical raw materials and clean energy ambitions. We look forward to sharing results as the study progresses,”_ said Thomas Abraham-James, President & CEO of Pulsar. Pulsar’s Tunu Project is located on the east coast of Greenland, near Ittoqqortoormiit and the Scoresby Sound fjord system. The Project is notable for being one of the few primary helium occurrences identified in Europe, with helium concentrations in sampled hot springs reaching up to 0.8%, and also demonstrates significant geothermal energy prospects with reservoir temperatures estimated between 80°C and 110°C, making cogeneration of power and heat potentially feasible. The gas composition is primarily nitrogen and helium, and is not associated with hydrocarbons, which is rare among global helium projects. A 2024 passive seismic survey identified two main low-velocity anomaly zones, indicating fractured reservoirs that could trap helium and provide targets for exploratory drilling, aligning with surface hydrothermal activity and faults linked to gas emissions. Pulsar holds first mover advantage for helium in Greenland, and is the first company to receive a licence for helium exploration in the country, granting exclusive rights for helium, hydrogen, and other minerals (excluding hydrocarbons and radioactive elements), and the Project’s location allows for efficient transport of helium to the European market while also offering the potential for renewable geothermal power for the local community.",

    "content": "Google and Baseload Capital sign a 10MW geothermal PPA in Taiwan, marking the country’s first corporate geothermal deal and doubling its installed capacity. In a landmark agreement that sets a new standard for clean energy procurement in Asia, **Google** and **Baseload Capital** have signed a **10 MW corporate power purchase agreement (PPA)** for geothermal energy in Taiwan – the first of its kind in the country. The deal not only includes long-term electricity supply to power Google’s data centers and offices in Taiwan, but also involves a **direct equity investment** by Google into Baseload Capital, aimed at accelerating the deployment of firm, 24/7 geothermal energy in the region and beyond. The partnership represents [Google’s first geothermal PPA](https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/geothermal-taiwan/) in the Asia-Pacific region and signals increasing corporate interest in firm renewable energy to meet the growing demands of AI and hyperscale data center operations. _“Through this long-term partnership with Baseload, we aim to unlock geothermal potential, driving the clean energy development needed to help decarbonize our operations and supply chains in Taiwan and globally,”_ said Michael Terrell, Sr. Director of Clean Energy and Carbon Reduction at Google. **Doubling Taiwan’s Geothermal Capacity** The 10 MW of capacity to be added through this partnership is **expected to come online in 2029** and **will double Taiwan’s current installed geothermal capacity** , which stands at approximately 7 MW across five small-scale projects. Taiwan’s government has set ambitious goals of reaching 20 MW by 2025 and 6 GW by 2050. Baseload Capital, a Sweden-based geothermal investment firm, has operated in Taiwan since 2019 through its local subsidiary [Baseload Power Taiwan](https://www.baseloadcap.com/baseload-power-taiwan/). The company is actively developing several projects in the country, including one in Hualien, which remains in the drilling phase and is expected to deliver 2 MW upon completion. “This agreement underscores the growing market recognition of – and demand for – 24/7 clean, firm energy. Our partnership highlights how Baseload’s mission aligns with Google’s portfolio, creating powerful synergies for sustainable tech growth,” said Alexander Helling, CEO of Baseload Capital. **A Model for the Region** Taiwan’s location on the Pacific Ring of Fire gives it considerable geothermal potential – estimated between 30 to 60 GW- yet commercial development has lagged behind other renewable sources. The Google–Baseload agreement is positioned as a catalyst for geothermal market growth in Asia, helping de-risk investment and spur corporate procurement. Globally, this is not Google’s first step into geothermal. In 2023, the tech company [secured 115 MW of geothermal power through a clean transition tariff with NV Energy and Fervo Energy in Nevada](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/google-to-increase-geothermal-power-supply-to-data-centers-via-nevada-utility/). In another bold move, [Meta also signed a deal with Sage Geosystems for up to 150 MW of geothermal power](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/meta-signs-150-mw-geothermal-power-purchase-agreement-with-sage-geosystems/) in the U.S., expected online by 2027. **For the Geothermal Sector** The announcement demonstrates how major technology firms are now driving demand for firm, always-available renewable energy and expanding geothermal’s role in global decarbonization. It also showcases Baseload Capital’s growing portfolio and ability to attract world-leading partners, reinforcing its position as a key player in next-generation geothermal investment.

    "content": "The Ministry of Mines and Energy has granted Ecopetrol a geothermal exploration permit for the Azufral site in Nariño, Colombia with a potential 80-MW capacity. The [Minister of Mines and Energy of Colombia](https://www.minenergia.gov.co/) has officially signed the resolution granting local energy company [Ecopetrol](https://www.ecopetrol.com.co/) the geothermal exploration permit for the the 148-km² Azufral001 area, located in the municipalities of Guachucal, Mallama, Santacruz, Sapuyes, and Túquerres, in the department of Nariño. The project will aim to determine the potential generation capacity for the license area, initially estimated at 80 MW. The permit, valid for five years, begins the exploratory phase, during which Ecopetrol will conduct geological, geochemical, and geophysical studies, as well as drill wells to determine the technical and economic viability of the resource. Initial studies indicate that subsurface temperatures in Azufral are between 230 to 280 °C. The launch of the geothermal exploration project was chaired by Gustavo Petro, the President of Colombia, who emphasized that geothermal is one of the clean energies that must be exploited, and that the government must remove environmental barriers to its development. Ricardo Roa Barragán, President of Ecopetrol, added that the initiative is a significant step towards the company’s goal of sustainable operations and a more diverse energy mix. The company has also been involved in geothermal initiatives elsewhere in Colombia, such as in [Caldas](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/ecopetrol-to-proceed-with-drilling-for-caldas-geothermal-project-colombia/) and in the [Nereidas Valley](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/ecopetrol-baker-hughes-chec-partner-up-for-nereidas-valley-geothermal-project-colombia/). _“This demonstrates that the energy transition is not a fairy tale: we are making it a reality, and no one can stop us. It is the beginning of a legacy that consolidates Colombia as a leader in clean energy sources such as solar, wind, hydrogen, and now, also the heat of the earth,_ ” further added Edwin Palma Egea, Minister of Mines and Energy. Ecopetrol must strictly comply with the technical, environmental, and social requirements established in Resolution 40302 of 2022 and Decree 1598 of 2024, which regulate the development of geothermal energy in Colombia. This includes providing compliance guarantees, obtaining environmental licenses, and submitting periodic reports on the progress of exploration activities.

    "content": "The Governor of Virginia has signed into law a bill that will make geothermal power eligible under the state's Renewable Energy Portfolio Standards. Governor of Virginia Glenn Youngkin (R) has signed into law [Senate Bill 1316](https://legiscan.com/VA/text/SB1316/id/3231370), which proposes to include geothermal energy as one of the eligible renewable technologies under the state’s Renewables Portfolio Standard. The bill was authored Senator Jeremy McPike (D). The Renewables Portfolio Standard, introduced in 2020 via House Bill 1526, established a mandatory renewable portfolio standard for electric utilities and suppliers in Virginia. The law mandates that Phase II utilities generate 100% of their power from renewable sources, and that Phase I utilities follow by 2050. With the amendment, utilities can now shift to “geothermal electric generating resources” to comply with the Renewables Portfolio Standard. It joins other renewable energy sources including solar and wind, waste-to-energy, hydropower, geothermal heating and cooling, and biomass. There was also a move to include nuclear under the renewable energy sources eligible under the standard, but this was rejected by members of the General Assembly. _“The geology of Virginia may not be perfect for [geothermal], but we want companies to explore it as a renewable source,”_ McPike says. _“And so, this is something that hasn’t been in the code. I think by adding it, it’s a signal that, ‘hey, we’re interested [in] adding it to our renewable portfolio standard.’”_ _“I’m very glad that the governor has been a leader in energy his administration. I think that’s one of his legacy points is energy planning,”_ said Thomas Turner, the Virginia state director of Conservatives for Clean Energy._“And I’m really thankful that he has embraced the all-of-the-above approach to energy, as many Republican governors have across the country.”_",

    "content": "The German Geothermal Association has launched a campaign promoting the use of geothermal energy for cooling - just in time for another very hot summer! Did you know that geothermal can also be a source for cooling? As summers get hotter and extreme weather events happen more frequently, geothermal can provide an energy source for countering heat stress without increasing CO2 emissions. This is the central message of a new campaign launched by the [German Geothermal Association](https://www.geothermie.de/) (Bundesverband Geothermie / BVG). The campaign, **“Staying cool is also possible with geothermal energy!”** highlights all the available technologies that can be used to harness geothermal energy for cooling, and the potential efficiency gains and cost reduction. As the BVG states, less than 10% of Germans know that geothermal energy can also be used for cooling. To promote awareness, the association prepared five short videos to demonstrate how geothermal is ideal for efficient and sustainable cooling of buildings and houses in summer, without the need for energy-hungry air conditioning systems. The short videos can be seen at the BVG’s social media channels – [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bundesverband-geothermie-e.v./?viewAsMember=true), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bundesverband_geothermie), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/p/Geothermie-100063860029676), and [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@bundesverband_geothermie?lang=de-DE). Moreover, the campaign landing page provides some useful numbers on the different types of geothermal cooling technologies, as well as some useful links to practical knowledge on how such technologies can be implemented. Examples of applications of geothermal for cooling are becoming increasingly widespread globally, whether in [communities](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/cascade-idaho-exploring-geothermal-district-heating-and-cooling/), [industries](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/strataphy-partners-with-al-ittefaq-steel-to-deploy-geothermal-cooling-in-steel-manufacturing/), or [commercial districts](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/first-geothermal-cooling-plant-in-masdar-city-uae-starts-operations/).",

    "content": "The State of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany has announced an expanded subsidy program for residents and buildings aiming to utilize geothermal heat pumps. The state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) in Germany has increased subsidies for the installation of sustainable heating solutions using geothermal heat pumps. New funding opportunities related to geothermal heating have also been announced. The state subsidies for geothermal drilling have been increased as follows: * New buildings will receive subsidies of €35 per meter instead of €5 * Existing buildings will receive subsidies of €50 per meter instead of €10 Aside from residents, companies and municipalities can also benefit from these funding opportunities. As part of the progres.nrw – Climate Protection Technology, new funding opportunities have been announced and existing ones have been improved: * Municipalities are supported in managing the heat planning process through the “Educational Premium for Municipal Heat Planning.” * Networked heat supply solutions being developed by homeowners’s associations, non-profit organizations, public institutions, and companies can apply for funding via the “Heating Concepts for Neighborhoods.” * The state supports the use of wastewater heat to supply residential buildings, office buildings, and municipal buildings through the “Systems for extracting heat for pipeline-based heat supply.” * The state promotes the use of geothermal heating for single and two-family homes through the funding module “Near-surface geothermal energy in combination with a heat pump.” Through the progres.nrw – Climate Protection Technology program, the state of NRW has provided nearly €20 million in funding in 2024 alone, supporting 1250 geothermal energy systems proposed by citizens, municipalities, and companies. _“In North Rhine-Westphalia, we want climate-friendly heating to become the new standard, not the exception – affordable, predictable, and accessible to everyone. That’s why we’re now promoting the switch to renewable heat sources such as geothermal energy even more strongly. This will ease the burden on our wallets through lower energy costs, protect our climate, and make us less dependent on expensive fossil fuel imports,”_ said Minister of Economic Affairs and Energ Mona Neubaur. _“Especially in times of rising energy prices and international crises, a reliable, clean, and affordable heat supply is a key to future security for all of us. Whether in a single-family home, a rental apartment, or a municipal building: every investment in renewable heat is a win for the environment, regional value creation, and the people here in North Rhine-Westphalia. Together, we are shaping the heat transition – practically, concretely, and in solidarity.”_ Elsewhere in the state, the [Geological Survey of North Rhine-Westphalia](https://geowaerme.nrw.de/) (GD NRW) has announced plans for[ geothermal research drilling in the city of Cologne](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/cologne-sets-sights-on-deep-geothermal-potential/) by the end of the year. This follows up on ongoing research drilling in Krefeld, which has reached the target depth of 957 meters and has done a hydraulic test as of a June 2025 update.",

    "title": "Bringing geothermal in from the margins – Anne Murrell, Lead of the Geothermal UK Coalition",
    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "8 Sep 2025",
    "content": "In the first entry of the Voices of Geothermal UK series, Anne Murrell discusses the vision and next steps of the new Geothermal UK coalition. As the geothermal sector gains momentum in the UK, it has also started expanding into different technologies and markets. From its rich history of shallow geothermal heating, the UK has now had success in developing mine water heating schemes and emerging projects are looking into geothermal power generation and lithium extraction. With now a more diversified and rapidly growing sector, the **[Geothermal UK](https://www.geothermaluk.org/)** coalition was launched [to give the industry a unified voice](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-coalition-launches-to-promote-and-unlock-uks-geothermal-potential/). Over the next few weeks, we will hear from some key UK industry players in the interview series:**‘Voices of Geothermal UK’.** UK developers, delivery experts and advisors will explain the opportunities they see for geothermal expansion in the UK, the challenges they are facing and the importance of collaboration to enable growth. We start off this series with **Anne Murrell** , Lead of the UK Geothermal Coalition, as she discusses the objectives of the coalition, its current standing, the its next steps in advocating for geothermal in the UK. Over the coming weeks, we will be publishing more interviews giving insights on the future of geothermal in the UK. Watch out for features on the following personalities: * Jordan Weddepohl, Arup * Tamsin Lishman, Kensa * Karen Spenley, Celsius Energy * David Townsend, TownRock Energy * Stuart Sinclair, Consortium Drilling * Gus Grand, Eden Geothermal Key industry stakeholders launched Geothermal UK earlier this year to address both the energy challenges and geothermal sector challenges in the UK. Firstly, the UK is facing**energy challenges** which geothermal can help to solve. These include the climate crisis and resulting need for decarbonisation, rising energy costs and widespread fuel poverty, the need for energy security, and grid capacity issues as we shift to renewables. The government’s target for the UK to become a ‘Clean Energy Superpower’ aims to tackle these challenges, and geothermal has a key role to play in this. Secondly, we are experiencing **geothermal industry challenges** as the sector beings to expand. We see growing momentum in specific areas and technologies, such as the deep geothermal projects in Cornwall, mine water projects in the North East, and city heat networks across the country. We need to optimise all this great work through national coordination, enabling strategic follow-through and the sharing of knowledge and experience. In summary, we need a unified voice to bring the industry together and engage policy: this is Geothermal UK. We want to establish geothermal as a mainstream part of the UK energy system, especially for clean heat. Geothermal UK will help to scale the sector responsibly and collaboratively. In practical terms we will support real project delivery, and we aim to become a trusted hub for all, including government, industry, local authorities and funders. We are an industry-led, UK-focused coalition, grounded in implementation. Our governance model, underpinned by a Charter, enables the credible, inclusive coordination of – and collaboration with – all stakeholders, whilst championing the unique UK geothermal brand. Other organisations have powerful lobbying roles to play, or they represent key stakeholder groups and companies, or have a specific technical focus. And there are international groups, enabling the sharing of learnings across borders, and also organisations representing renewables as a whole, within which geothermal needs to have a seat at the table. Geothermal UK wants to collaborate with these organisations, bringing together all the facets required to support the growth of our UK geothermal industry. Geothermal UK is a coalition of geothermal stakeholders and supporters with developers at its heart. Founding members include representatives of all geothermal technologies, our supply chain and other experts. We are currently volunteer-led, and formalisation of our structure is on the horizon. We welcome all who are aligned to our core principles to join the coalition, including industry, academics, customers, NGOs, funders and others. The first step is to sign the Charter (found on [www.geothermaluk.org](http://www.geothermaluk.org)), then participate in working groups as suits your interest, skill-set and time availability. The primary issue is lack of awareness of geothermal energy and its potential – within government, investors and the public. There is a lack of policy visibility and there are no dedicated support frameworks (permitting, regulation etc.). We need a national roadmap, integrating geothermal into our energy system. Our event calendar is pretty full over the next couple of months, including the next in our series of MP breakfasts in Parliament, industry/ government roundtables and investor events. We are also continuing our webinar series to inform and engage with our community. We are strengthening our working groups – policy, comms and funding – and making sure that geothermal energy in the UK is positioned prominently within broader discussions, at the same time as enhancing our strong, unique geothermal identity. Regarding the organisation itself, we are exploring fiscal hosting options and developing funding avenues to move from a volunteer-based structure to sustainable operations. Geothermal energy provides a proven, place-based and sustainable solution. It provides clean heat at scale, and can play a key role in Britain’s ambition to become a Clean Energy Superpower. Geothermal energy is underutilised in the UK and should have strategic focus within the UK energy system. Geothermal UK is a credible industry voice to inform and co-create impactful policy, and a powerful coalition to enable the delivery of geothermal solutions across the UK. Our earth has huge potential to fulfil our energy needs – let’s use it! If you believe that geothermal will play a vital role in the UK’s energy future, join us! Whether you’re a developer, policymaker, community leader, funder or engineer, Geothermal UK needs your input. Help us build the future of UK geothermal together.

    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "19 Sep 2025",
    "content": "Zanskar has drilled a 137 °C geothermal well at 760 meters depth at the Pumpernickel site in Nevada, further validating their AI-based discovery tools. Zanskar is the first AI-native geothermal company using AI to transform the discovery, assessment, and delivery of geothermal energy. With the resource confirmed via deep drilling, Zanskar will now move to full power development for the Pumpernickel site. The company will drill and construct production and injections wells and power plant, with the first phase of development expected to start delivering electricity to the grid within just three years. Following their [great success at the Lightning Dock geothermal field in New Mexico](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/zanskar-repowers-lightning-dock-geothermal-facility-in-new-mexico-to-full-capacity/), Zanskar set out to validate their AI-enabled modeling and targeting tools to explore the geothermal potential at a greenfield site. The Pumpernickel site, located at the Pumpernickel Valley, is described as having sparse data and much higher degree of uncertainty compared to Lightning Dock. Previous attempts at geothermal development at Pumpernickel have been documented [through](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/nevada-geothermal-power/) [the years](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/sierra-geothermal-power-drops-pumpernickel-option/). The stochastic reservoir modeling approach used in Lightning Dock was also used to plan the wells in Pumpernickel. Using the available legacy geologic data sets and shallow exploration wells, a range of geological scenarios was generated, which were the bases for the recommended drilling targets based on maximizing both temperature and permeability. The two best recommendations were used for well targeting. The first well encountered difficult drilling conditions related to hot and unstable formations. The second well reached the target depth, despite challenges in encountering multiple zones of total circulation loss. Despite difficulties in drilling, all these conditions are indicative of a hot and permeable geothermal system. Aside from encountering high temperatures at relatively shallow depth, the well also encountered multiple loss zones and artesian flow zones. The thick (>60 ft / 18 m) damage zones correlate to exceptional permeability. Based on heat-in-place calculations at <2 kilometers depth, the site can support a Phase 1 20-MWe development. The success at Pumpernickel proves that there are still greenfield sites in the USA that can be developed for power generation, even at sites where previous attempts have failed. The Pumpernickel site also proves that there is still untapped potential at hydrothermal or “conventional” geothermal resources in the USA, thus countering the perception that next-generation solutions like EGS are the only way to grow the industry. _“Our team’s ability to execute with these AI tools and precision drilling is unparalleled,”_ said Carl Hoiland, Co-founder and CEO at Zanskar. _“Our vertically-integrated, AI-native approach to geothermal development is delivering the speed to discovery and speed to development necessary to meet the new paradigm of rapid energy demand growth. These latest deep drilling results only further confirm what we’ve known all along: conventional geothermal resources are far more abundant and bigger than previously believed and are the lowest-cost route to delivering gigawatts of reliable, carbon-free, baseload power at scale.”_ Using artificial intelligence, advanced geoscience modeling, and modern data collection methods, Zanskar is aiming to make geothermal resource discovery faster, cheaper, and more scalable. Zanskar has already reduced discovery costs per MW by an order of magnitude compared to inflation-adjusted costs incurred by geothermal’s last major greenfield explorers. _“At Zanskar, our combination of modern, low-cost, field data collection and large compute geospatial models is proving that we can uncover geothermal resources others miss.”_ said Joel Edwards, Co-founder and CTO at Zanskar. _“But claiming a site has power potential is a lot easier than proving it with a drill bit. Pumpernickel is the latest example of when we go where our models tell us, we deliver, and we’re set up to do this over and over again.” ._",

First announced in April 2025, the project by GeoFrame Energy targets production of approximately 83,500 metric tons of battery-grade lithium carbonate annually. The DLE process will utilize advanced solvent extraction methods developed by Ekosolve Inc. and the University of Melbourne. The technology is claimed to provide 92 to 95% lithium recovery rate at a considerably lower capital and production cost and a small operational footprint. According to GeoFrame Energy, the project will be the first to extract lithium carbonate from the Smackover Formation, which is an extensive and permeable limestone aquifer that hosts a large volume of mineral-rich brine. By establishing a reliable, homegrown supply, the project offers significant economic and strategic benefits. The project will initially utilize the geothermal fluids to generate electricity via binary cycle generators, fully powering its DLE lithium extraction and lithium carbonate production plants. Any excess electricity will be sold to the grid. _“GeoFrame Energy’s East Texas Project will lead the United States’ domestic lithium production and will be the first to deliver battery-grade lithium carbonate from the Smackover Formation,_ ” said Bruce Cutright, CEO, GeoFrame Energy. _“Halliburton, as a critical member of our team, will support the drilling phase of our project through the construction, design, and operation of the demonstration wells and the expansion into full field development.”_ [**RELATED: CTR geothermal lithium project recognized by US federal permitting program**](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/ctr-geothermal-lithium-project-recognized-by-us-federal-permitting-program/)",

    "content": "A piece by Tom Ough for the IFP examines the impact of the Utah FORGE for the geothermal sector, both in technical progress and in attracting further funding. A fantastic article written by Tom Ough for the think tank [Institute for Progress](https://ifp.org/) (IFP) closely examines the Utah FORGE projects, its history, results, and impact on the wider field of geothermal research and innovation. **[Read the original piece via this link.](https://ifp.org/why-forge-works/#industry-and-investor-response)** The funding opportunity for the Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) programme [was first announced back in 2014](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/doe-forge-webinar-slides-available/). The first phase of the project was the selection of the project site, of which [five candidates were considered](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/roadtrip-to-the-candidates-for-the-forge-geothermal-research-project-in-the-u-s/): California, Utah, Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon. The site near Milford in Beaver County, Utah was selected in 2018, after [some preliminary drilling](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/drilling-started-at-forge-geothermal-research-project-in-utah/) had been done. Led by the University of Utah’s Energy and Geoscience Institute, the USD 218 million budget of Utah FORGE lasted through mid-2024. FORGE had a small team led by Dr. Joseph Moore, working in partnership with private enterprise. The objective of the project is to reduce the cost of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) by 90%, to USD45 per MWh by 2035. This was to be done by developing innovative drilling and reservoir stimulation techniques, as well as tools to establish well connectivity. We have reported extensively on the technical achievements of Utah FORGE [through the years](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/?s=forge). The project has increased its drilling speeds by fivefold, [demonstrated successful well connectivity](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/utah-forge-reports-successful-stimulation-and-circulation-at-egs-site/) through stage-wise stimulation, and has provided a test environment for high-temperature drilling equipment. Just as importantly, all of the technical data from the Utah FORGE project are [publicly accessible via the project Wiki page](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/utah-forge-publishes-wiki-dashboard-for-open-access-data/). Based on IFP’s research and interviews, there have been early signs of success on this front. The results of FORGE has benefited established geothermal players like Ormat Technologies and have been instrumental to the EGS efforts of Fervo Energy. The numbers are not quite there yet, as Fervo is selling electricity at USD 100 per MWh based on [a PPA with Southern California Edison.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/fervo-signs-320-mw-geothermal-ppa-with-california-utility/) However, another aspiration was for the Utah FORGE project to spur more investment into the geothermal sector. Despite all the progress that Utah FORGE has made, its USD 218 million budget is a fraction of investments in other next-generation energy technologies, such as carbon management (USD 7 billion), advanced nuclear (USD 3.3 billion), and hydrogen hubs (USD 8 billion). In recent years, there has been a growth in investor interest in various geothermal startups and ventures. A detailed discussion of this phenomenon will warrant its own article, but it suffices to say that geothermal companies have attracted investments from various sources including banks, institutional investors, venture capitalists, and private equity among others. While it would be a stretch to attribute all of the increased investment in the geothermal sector to the Utah FORGE project, there is no doubt that it has helped draw more attention from external stakeholders.",

    "content": "The 2025 Taiwan International Geothermal Conference reiterated the government's support for geothermal growth and provided a venue for industry collaboration. The [2025 Taiwan International Geothermal Conference](https://events.businesstoday.com.tw/2025/tigc2025/), hosted by the [Ministry of Economic Affairs](https://www.moea.gov.tw/MNS/english/), once again took place in Taipei from 24 – 25 of April. Now on its third edition, the conference was successful in bringing together leading geothermal experts, government representatives, and industry leaders from the United States, New Zealand, Canada, the Philippines, and other countries to explore cutting-edge technologies and the future development of geothermal energy. Held in a hybrid format with both in-person sessions and online streaming, the conference attracted more than 700 participants from around the world, including representatives from academia, industry, government, and research institutions. In his opening remarks, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Lai Chien-Hsin emphasized that amid the global climate change, the government is committed to implementing a range of carbon reduction measures to ensure sustainable energy transition. Promoting renewable energy, he noted, is critical to achieving these goals. Vice Minister Lai highlighted geothermal energy’s pivot role in Taiwan’s energy transition. With Taiwan’s favorable geological conditions, it has completed the construction of six geothermal power plants. This year, more geothermal power plants will be connected to the grid. He sincerely welcomed all geothermal scholars, developers and experts to participate in 2025 Taiwan International Geothermal Conference, believing that through collaboration between international enterprises and local Taiwanese companies, they can contribute to achieving net-zero emission goals and jointly address the challenges of extreme climate. The conference featured a broad range of topics, including the status of geothermal energy development in Taiwan, international industry trends, advanced technologies and innovative applications, and the role of local governments in promoting geothermal power development. The Energy Administration and the Geological Survey and Mining Management Agency presented Taiwan’s geothermal policies and exploration progress. Meanwhile, the CPC Corporation and Taiwan Power Company delivered special reports on development strategies and recent technical breakthroughs, which have attracted investment interest from domestic and international companies. Afternoon sessions focused on cutting-edge project management and international drilling experiences, exploring how to leverage advanced technology and optimized practices to support local developers, accelerate geothermal plant construction, and enhance industry competitiveness. The first day of the conference concluded with a high-level dialogue moderated by the Acting Director-General of the Energy Administration Lee Chun-Li joined by representatives from the global geothermal industry, research institutes, and government sectors. The discussion centered on **“The Future Outlook for Geothermal Power in Taiwan,”** highlighting strategies to attract international investment, expand the geothermal industry value chain, and strengthen Taiwan’s presence in the global green energy market. On April 25, the second day of the conference, three professional workshops were on “Geothermal Drilling Technology,” “Development Solutions,” and “Exploration and Equipment Applications.” The conference also featured a technical site visit for international guests to CPC Corporation’s Yuanshan No.1 Well, [Taiwan’s first deep geothermal exploratory well.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/drilling-starts-on-4-km-geothermal-well-in-yuanshan-yilan-county-taiwan/) Jointly developed by Academia Sinica and CPC and currently drilled to a depth of 1,820 meters, this well marks a key milestone for Taiwan’s deep geothermal progress, offering international stakeholders a firsthand look at Taiwan’s geothermal potential and supportive development environment. Through this international platform, Taiwan aims to strengthen global partnerships, foster innovation, accelerate the growth of its geothermal sector, and advance toward the long-term goal of sustainable energy. **[RELATED: UT Austin and NTOU Partner on Taiwan Geothermal](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/ut-austin-and-ntou-partner-on-taiwan-geothermal/)**",

    "content": "An international consortium of academic and industry partners have applied for funding to validate closed-loop geothermal technology in Western Ukraine. An international consortium led by [Getech](https://getech.com/) has submitted an application for a tender by the governments of Ukraine and the UK with the goal of technically validating next-generation geothermal energy technology in Western Ukraine. The outcome of the grant application is expected during summer 2025. The consortium includes energy and mineral resources company Getech, along with Swedish energy technology company [Jordkraft Energy AB](https://jordkraft.com/), UGV (part of the Naftogaz Group), as well as academic and industry partners from the UK, Ukraine, Poland, and Lithuania. The consortium will test Jordkraft’s proprietary, patent-pending technology for closed-loop geothermal systems in sedimentary rock formations. The project has identified promising test sites in the Transcarpathian region, where the geology, similar to Sweden but with shallower heat reservoirs, offers ideal conditions for demonstrating the feasibility of deep, closed-loop geothermal systems in hard rock. The pilot aims to validate this as a scalable, secure baseload solution for Eastern Europe. _“We’re excited to be part of this strong, multi-national consortium bidding for this important opportunity. It closely aligns with our global geothermal sweet-spotting expertise and our core strengths in gravity and magnetic data processing and geoscience interpretation. Regardless of the tender outcome, this collaboration is already proving valuable – enabling us to exchange knowledge, build new relationships and expand our network. We look forward to the results and the potential to further advance geothermal’s role in the global energy mix,”_ said Max Brouwers, Chief Business Development Officer of Getech. _“Joining this consortium marks a major breakthrough for us. Ukraine holds vast geothermal potential, and we see an important role for our technology in strengthening energy independence, security and supporting sustainable reconstruction,”_ added Jessica Friberg, CEO and co-founder of Jordkraft. The grant-giving body is [InnovateUkraine](https://innovateukraine.io/), a program that supports green energy innovation projects in Ukraine. The program was first launched in 2024 and announced a second round of investment in early 2025. A total of £17 million was on offer during the second round. The consortium has applied for a total budget of £1.41 million over a 24-month period to support the technical viability project for next-generation geothermal.",

As with every year, ThinkGeoEnergy will be taking a two-week summer break and will be back with regular news reporting by the 22nd of July 2025. This will also mean pausing our newsletter after the 8th of July edition, with the next issue to go out on the 29th of July. There will be no news article published during this two-week period. We will maintain some activity on the[ ThinkGeoEnergy LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/thinkgeoenergy/), mostly recapping some of the major stories that have happened in the geothermal sector in the year thus far. We will also use this time to work on our plans to revamp many of our pages, as well as some of our branding elements. Geopolitical instability and armed conflict in many parts of the world has taken up much of the focus for the first half of the year. While we continue to focus on geothermal stories, such discussions are difficult to avoid. It is perhaps in situations like these that the value of a secure, locally sourced, and stable energy supply needs to be highlighted more. We continue to advocate for geothermal as an energy source that can bring about energy independence, inclusive economic growth, and reduction in carbon emissions. The geothermal sector, of course, has had no shortage of positive stories this year. [Several geothermal power plants](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/lumut-balai-unit-2-geothermal-power-plant-in-indonesia-now-fully-operational/) have already come online in Indonesia, pioneering geothermal efforts are gaining ground in emerging countries like [India](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/indian-army-inaugurates-geothermal-based-net-zero-energy-building/), [Austria](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/drilling-starts-for-first-deep-geothermal-project-in-vienna-austria/), [Saudi Arabia](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/strataphy-completes-multiple-geothermal-drilling-and-testing-campaigns-in-saudi-arabia/), and [Spain](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/first-geothermal-drilling-in-tenerife-canary-islands-to-begin-by-fall-2025/), and new regulatory frameworks have strengthened support for geothermal in [Mexico](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/mexican-president-proposes-revamped-geothermal-law-as-part-of-energy-reforms/) and [the USA](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/ormat-geothermal-projects-to-be-covered-by-us-emergency-permitting-procedures/). With more than 520 geothermal articles published this year so far on ThinkGeoEnergy, summarizing everything that has happened for the 1st half of 2025 is going to be a monumental effort. We’re doing it anyway. After our break, we will be publishing a report on the biggest stories, trends, and developments that have happened in the global geothermal sector so far. We hope this helps provide a more realistic and grounded view of the geothermal market to business developers, investors, policymakers, and other stakeholders. We have also often been asked about the beginnings of ThinkGeoEnergy. The site has been around for about 16 years now, with dozens and dozens of stories of what is happening behind the scenes. We are thus working on a series of articles on the history of ThinkGeoEnergy, how it came into its current form, and the steps we are taking to continue to be relevant and valuable for the geothermal industry. Until then, we wish all our readers a pleasant summer, and we hope everyone has an opportunity to take a break as well. We will be back in two weeks with recharged batteries and brains full of new ideas.

    "content": "A seismic data acquisition campaign has been done to evaluate the feasibility of deep geothermal for heating in Aix-en-Provence in southern France. A seismic data acquisition campaign had recently been done in the city of Aix-en-Provence in Southern France as part of exploration efforts for potential deep geothermal resource utilization. The survey covered the streets of both Éguilles and Aix-en-Provence to collect seismic data which will help characterize and identify subsurface geological layers. The city of Aix-en-Provence is exploring the possibility of deep geothermal to decarbonize its existing heating network, which currently already provides 28,000 residents with heating and domestic hot water. Currently, renewable energy in Aix-en-Provence is exclusively supplied by biomass. The city would like to diversify this, while also increasing the renewable energy rate to 87%. The city has entrusted [ENGIE Solutions](https://www.engie.com/en/engie-solutions-support) with the task of both decarbonizing and expanding its heating network. If the results of exploration efforts are positive, boreholes of up to 2 kilometers depth will be drilled and are expected to extract water at temperatures of around 70 °C. The geothermal heating plant is scheduled to be operational in 2028, and will be located in Constance. Matthieu Fuentes, Project Manager at ENGIE Solutions, pointed out that the energy mix of biomass and geothermal will be alternated according to the seasons. During the summer period, geothermal alone should be able to meet the heating needs. Thus, there will no longer be any emissions from natural gas during summer. Majority of the geothermal installations in France are around the Île-de-France region. Geothermal development in Aix-en-Provence may open up an entirely new region for geothermal growth in France, further solidifying its position in the field of geothermal heating. **[RELATED: France finalizes action plan for geothermal sector development](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/france-finalizes-action-plan-for-geothermal-sector-development/)**",

Drilling for geothermal resources is expected to start within the by December 2025 in the town of Geiselbullach in the municipality of Olching in Bavaria, Germany. This project aims to tap into geothermal resources to provide an alternative source for the existing district heating network, which is currently supplied by a waste-to-energy plant. The geothermal project will be headed by [Amperland Thermalwärme GmbH](https://www.amperland-thermalwaerme.de/) (ATW), a subsidiary of [Joint Municipal Company for Waste Management](https://www.gfa-online.com/) (Gemeinsames Unternehmen für Abfallwirtschaft / GfA), the company that currently operates the waste-to-energy plant. The plan is to drill a doublet that taps into the water-bearing layer of the Upper Jurassic aquifer at a depth of approximately 1,725 ??meters. Water temperature at this depth is expected to be about 73 °C. If the drilling and well testing results are positive, the company will then apply for a water law permit. The geothermal heating plant can then be operational by early 2027. Available seismic and drilling data was requested by ATW from the Bavarian State Office for the Environment. This data was then used to model subsurface structures and help identify the drilling targets. [The permit for drilling](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/waste-incineration-firm-in-olching-germany-to-drill-for-geothermal-heating/) was granted in later 2024. The geothermal project in Geiselbullach is supported by the Federal Funding for Efficient Heat Networks” (BEW) program of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection (BMWK), which provides a 40% investment subsidy for generation facilities and infrastructure. The combination of the construction of a geothermal plant and the expansion of the heat supply qualifies ATW for this funding.",

[The Spanish Geological and Mining Institute (IGME-CSIC)](https://www.igme.es/) has released the documentary **“1977: The Challenge of Deep Geothermal Energy in Lanzarote,”** a production that reconstructs one of the most significant scientific projects in Spanish geothermal history: the drilling of the Lanzarote-1 well, carried out between September and December 1978 in Timanfaya National Park. Through firsthand accounts, scientific documentation, photographs, and contemporary press reports, the documentary relives the context, development, and results of this pioneering initiative, which reached a depth of 2,702 meters—the largest land-based drilling record in the Canary Islands to date. The project emerged as part of the energy diversification efforts following the oil crisis of the 1970s. During that decade and the following one, IGME led intensive geothermal research activities in [Lanzarote](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-power-generation-to-be-explored-in-lanzarote-canary-islands/), [Gran Canaria](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/involcan-to-conduct-detailed-surface-exploration-for-geothermal-in-gran-canaria/), [Tenerife](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/canary-islands-government-approves-geothermal-exploration-drilling-in-tenerife/), and [La Palma](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/repsol-withdraws-from-geothermal-exploration-in-la-palma/), seeking to characterize the heat potential of the volcanic subsurface. The Hilario Islet area, where temperatures of up to 600°C are recorded at just 15 meters deep, was the focus of studies in Lanzarote. The Lanzarote-1 survey was carried out there, an unprecedented scientific project that, while not yielding favorable results for immediate energy use, provided valuable geological knowledge for the archipelago. With the fall in oil prices in the 1990s, many studies were suspended and the drilling infrastructure dismantled. However, the current boom in renewable energy and[ support from European funds](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/canary-islands-offers-funding-for-renewable-energy-projects/) have revived interest in deep geothermal energy in the Canary Islands, with new exploration permits being granted to public and private companies. This documentary not only recovers an essential part of the history of energy in Spain, but also opens the door to reflection on the present and future of geothermal energy in volcanic contexts like the Canary Islands. ? **[RELATED: First geothermal drilling in Tenerife, Canary Islands to begin by Fall 2025](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/first-geothermal-drilling-in-tenerife-canary-islands-to-begin-by-fall-2025/)**",

The municipality of Gräfelfing, near Munich, has celebrated the groundbreaking ceremony for its long-awaited deep geothermal project. Local leaders and project managers hailed the milestone as a decisive step toward a sustainable, CO2-neutral heating supply. Mayor Peter Köstler underlined that the project is now entirely under municipal ownership [after parting ways with former partner Silenos Energy earlier this year.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-heating-project-in-grafelfing-germany-to-proceed-without-private-partner/)_“With geothermal energy, we are setting a smart course for a climate-independent and secure energy future,”_ he said. _The move allows the municipality to directly manage financing and future heat pricing.”_ The geothermal company is being advanced by Gräfelfing’s municipal subsidiaries, led by managing director Thomas Banck and technical director Markus Schmelz. The team emphasized the dual goals of delivering affordable heat to citizens while minimizing local impacts from the drilling and heating plant construction. Preparations are now underway for the first construction phase on an 18,000 m² site. Drilling is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2026, with two wells reaching a depth of around 2,900 meters. Full drilling and testing could take up to a year. If successful, the system is expected to supply geothermal heat to local households from late 2028 or early 2029. The project is supported by federal funding under the BEW program for efficient heating networks, with the municipality covering the remainder through loans and its own capital. Initial exploration of geothermal resources in Gräfelfing dates back to 2009, when private developer Baldur Trinkl started seismic surveys. After his withdrawal, the municipality carried the project forward, culminating in this year’s groundbreaking. With expected water temperatures of 90-95°C, the Gräfelfing project could become a flagship example of community-led geothermal development in Bavaria’s Molasse Basin.",

    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "5 Aug 2025",
    "content": "IRENA reports that the global weighted average LCOE for geothermal power decreased by 16% in 2024, signaling stability and opportunity for further growth. The newly published**[“Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2024”](https://www.irena.org/Publications/2025/Jun/Renewable-Power-Generation-Costs-in-2024)** document by the [International Renewable Energy Agency](https://www.irena.org/) (IRENA) reports that the global weighted average Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for geothermal power generation has dropped by 16%, from USD 0.072/kWh to **0.060/kWh**. Although undoubtedly a positive development, this figures comes close to the 2022 value (USD 0.059/kWh) and is within the range of average LCOE values for the past 5 years (USD 0.059/kWh to USD 0.075/kWh) Compared to other renewables, geothermal power has a higher weighted average LCOE than hydropower (USD 0.057/kWh), solar PV (USD 0.043/kWh), and onshore wind (USD 0.034/kWh). However, LCOE values for concentrated solar power (CSP) (USD 0.092/kWh), bioenergy (USD 0.087/kWh), and offshore wind (USD 0.079/kWh) are still higher than geothermal. For the year 2024, LCOE values ranged from a high of USD 0.090 kWh (Indonesia) to as low as USD 0.033/kWh (Türkiye). The drop in the global weighted average LCOE was heavily influenced by the Tauhara II project, primarily driven by a lower Total Installed Cost for geothermal power in New Zealand. Given the unique nature of geothermal systems across different markets and geologies, geothermal power does not have the same standardized cost structures as that of onshore wind or solar PV. Geothermal power project costs are heavily influenced by reservoir quality, directly determining costs associated with drilling (including depth and number of wells) and power plant technology. Geothermal projects also have a very different risk profile, as the resource quality cannot be determined unless capital-intensive drilling has been done. The figure above succinctly shows this trend, with different regions having markedly different LCOE and TIC values for geothermal power. Capital costs for Indonesia were significantly higher than other regions, likely brought about by large-scale drilling and exploration campaigns. The drop for Türkiye was also significant, but currency exchange rate trends must be factored in analyzing this trend, particularly when all figures are expressed as USD. LCOE trends closely follow the TIC trends. However, O&M costs for geothermal can also be high because of make-up drilling, especially when the goal is to maintain high Capacity Factors (CF). The O&M cost assumption applied for projects commissioned in 2024 was USD 125/kW per year and USD 110/kW per year for projects deployed between 2010 and 2023. TIC and LCOE trends tend to fluctuate heavily year-to-year owing to the small number of geothermal power facilities that go online on any single year. This can make analysis of global trends complicated and potentially misleading. Thus, the situation warrants a closer look at local and regional factors that influence development costs. At an average of 88% for the year 2024, a high capacity factor remains one of the greatest strengths of geothermal over other forms of renewable power. This figure also went up by 7% from 2023. Average CFs for geothermal power have remained competitive since 2010, with values ranging from 77% to 88%. Compared to other renewables, geothermal power facilities are designed to operate most of the year and are not influenced by weather conditions or day-night cycles. There are still some variations in CF from one region to another due to resource quality, reservoir dynamics, and economic factors. **Technological trends provide optimism** The emergence of so-called “next-generation” technologies is giving plenty of optimism for geothermal power to grow beyond its current scope. Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) and Advanced Geothermal Systems (AGS) are striving to make geothermal power development possible in areas and regions previously not considered viable under the conventional geothermal method. Superhot geothermal seeks to increase the productivity of geothermal wells by tapping into much hotter resources. Such pioneering methods have also served as testing grounds for work to reduce drilling costs and improve stimulation methods. There are also efforts to pair geothermal with other renewables, potentially acting as energy storage for intermittent renewable energy sources like solar and wind. The geothermal industry continues to await the commercial-scale deployment of these next-generation technologies, with Fervo Energy and Eavor Technologies as some of the companies leading the way. Continued innovation and government support remain key factors to realizing the potential of such technologies. Overall, 2024 was a breakthrough year for renewable with an unprecedented 582 GW of new capacity addition. Solar PV contributed greatly to this surge, accounting for 77.8% of the total new capacity. On a per-country basis, China accounted for 61.2% of global solar PV additions and 69.4% of new wind installations. Although the total installed renewable power capacity reached 4,442 GW in 2024, this is still far from the target of 11,000+ GW by 2030 which was [agreed upon at COP28](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/the-cop28-pledge-to-triple-up-by-2030-and-implications-for-geothermal/). The growth of geothermal power has remained near-constant in 2024. Work being done in emerging markets (such as the Caribbean and Canary Islands), continued growth in the Pacific and East African regions, and technological innovations (including superhot geothermal and deep drilling technologies) are paving the way for exponential growth in the coming years.

    "author": "Luis C-A. Gutiérrez Negrín",
    "date": "23 May 2025",
    "content": "In this guest article, Luis C-A. Gutiérrez Negrín responds to the ownership issue of geothermal heat and sheds light on other issues holding back the industry. Alex Richter[ wrote an interesting commentary in ThinkGeoEnergy ](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-legal-study-asks-who-owns-geothermal-heat/)about the scholar article[ **“Who Owns Heat? Property Rights in Geothermal Energy”**](https://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Eckstein.pdf) authored by Professor Gabriel Eckstein of Texas A&M School of Law, and recently published in the University of Illinois Law Review, Vol. 2025, pp. 492-553. Eckstein introduces the subject in the very first lines of his foreword, mentioning that landowners in the US –and some other countries– _“can have ownership claims to oil, gas, water, and other tangible natural resources located in their subsoil. But can they also claim rights to the thermal energy found below their land?”_ So, as Richter remarks,_“Eckstein argues that the law remains largely unsettled when it comes to thermal energy.”_ In addition, Eckstein refers to geothermal energy as _“an incorporeal, uncontainable, natural resource that is better defined as a characteristic of underground formations rather than as a physical or tangible thing”_ and, as Richter mentions in his commentary, _“Geothermal energy is not a substance like water or minerals—it’s a condition or characteristic of subsurface formations.”_ Eckstein considers there are ambiguities _“in property rights related to the development and ownership of geothermal energy resources”_ (in the US), and then it is not clearly stated _“who is entitled to benefit from”_ (them). Therefore, writes Richter, _“the absence of clear legal ownership could hinder geothermal development in the United States.”_ In Eckstein’s opinion, _“the lack of clarity in property rights related to the development and ownership of geothermal energy resources_ ” is a barrier to the development of geothermal in the US,_“possibly more pernicious”_ than other well-known barriers like high upfront costs, technological limitations, and relatively high energy production costs. Eckstein concludes his long and very well documented study writing that is necessary to establish _“a property regime for geothermal energy resources,”_ which must be _“consistent not only within states, but across the nation,”_ and announces a _“follow-up article”_ where he will present his best approach to this subject. I will look forward to that new article, but in the meantime, I must confess I do not understand why this legal conundrum exists in the US. I am a geologist, not a lawyer –like Eckstein and Richter–, but in my opinion geothermal energy it is not really _“a condition or characteristic of subsurface formations,”_ but a specific type of energy –thermal energy–, that can be harvested with proper equipment and tools –like geothermal wells. It is certainly _“an incorporeal, uncontainable, natural resource”_ and therefore it is not _“a physical or tangible thing.”_ But more than _“a characteristic of underground formations”_ geothermal resources are simply thermal energy of the Earth, that can be naturally concentrated by fluids in some parts of the subsurface, called hydrothermal systems or reservoirs, or diffused in the rocks. Thermal energy is also produced by the sun and can be harvested by superficial thermo-solar installations located on a private or public land, whose owner is entitled to benefit from the thermal energy of the sun collected within the limits of their property. The landowner also can get benefit from the wind blowing on their property, by installing the proper towers and wind-turbines to generate electricity, and from the sunlight by installing solar panels able to transform the sunlight in electricity through the photo-electric effect. Sunlight, solar heat, and wind are also incorporeal, uncontainable, and natural resources, whose logical beneficiary is anyway the owner of the superficial land where the proper installations are installed. Subsurface thermal energy –or geothermal energy– produced by radioactive decay of some minerals or as residue of the planet formation 4.5 billion years ago, must be in a similar situation of legal ownership. Nothing more, but nothing less. In other countries, like Mexico, whose constitutional system is based on the Roman droit, all the subsurface resources are an original property of the nation, who can grant the use, exploitation, and/or benefit of those resources to particulars during certain time and/or under certain conditions. There, it is clear than any sort of energy or material resource with some intrinsic or extrinsic commercial value, including simple rocks for quarry, are property of the person that holds the proper titles, licenses, or permits issued by the federal government on behalf of the nation –which is not necessarily the same landowner. Thus, in countries with constitutional systems based on Anglo-Saxon droit, the question about who owns the subsurface heat should be enough clear, since the original ownership corresponds to the first person that claimed the land (first in place, first in right), and not from an entelechy called the nation. However, as Eckstein remarks, there are many different interpretations and requirements to grant geothermal licenses or permits among the fifty states of the union, and even among counties, because the general concept is one thing, but the practical specificities are other. One obvious way to overcome that, is proposing a federal law on geothermal resources, to uniformize all the particularities not only about ownership but also about regulations. Of course, there is the [Geothermal Steam Act](https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media_wysiwyg/geothermal-steam-act-of-1970.pdf) (GSA), but I understand it has a limited scope since it is focused on geothermal resources located in federal lands managed by the [Bureau of Land Management](https://www.blm.gov/d8-home) (BLM). There are also geothermal laws in several countries in the world, even in some countries with no current geothermal use at all –like Ethiopia. One of the countries with geothermal specific law is Mexico, whose original act (LEG: Ley de Energía Geotérmica) was passed in 2014, and now [there is a new Geothermal Law](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/mexican-president-proposes-revamped-geothermal-law-as-part-of-energy-reforms/) (LG: Ley de Geotermia), which focuses on geothermal resources for electricity generation, passed in March 2025. Thus, contrarily to the case of the US, as presented by Eckstein, the slow geothermal development in Mexico has not been due to ambiguities in the ownership of the resource, or to the lack of a geothermal act, but for the usual hurdles: high upfront costs, more risks in the exploration stage, relatively high levelized costs, and technological limitations… In any case, having a geothermal law is an advantage.

    "content": "A study done in Slovenia evaluates the economic and technical viability of using shallow geothermal for storage and cooling of agricultural produce. The results of the GeoCOOL Food project were recently presented to the public, providing initial guidelines on the use of geothermal energy for agricultural cold storage in Slovenia. The study indicates that the potential exists, but factors can vary greatly such as the solutions cannot be standard and that economic viability must be assessed for each project. The GeoCOOL Food project, which started in 2022, aimed to examine the possibilities of using shallow geothermal for storing and cooling of food in small agricultural food stores. The study was done by experts from the [Geological Survey of Slovenia](https://www.geo-zs.si/en/), the [Jozef Stefan Institute](https://www.ijs.si/ijsw/JSI), and the [Biotechnical Faculty of the University of Ljubljana](https://www.bf.uni-lj.si/en/). As part of the studies, a 100-meter deep research well was built in a pilot farm in Podbo?je where optical cables for temperature monitoring were installed. According to Nina Rman, Project Manager at the Geological Survey of Slovenia, this was the first time that shallow geothermal energy was used for agriculture in Slovenia. _“We know that geothermal is already being used to heat three greenhouses. However, we have not yet registered any use for cold storage facilities.”_ Rajko Vidrih from the Faculty of Biotechnology stated that storing produce in cold conditions extends their shelf life and helps maintain good quality._“This is important from both nutritional and economic perspectives.”_ Based on the study results, the use of shallow geothermal energy for cooling is possible but the costs make it economically viable only in specific cases. Gašper Stegnar from the Jožef Stefan Institute emphasized that such applications require large investment, but the energy savings can be quite small. Thus, grants would be instrumental in helping deploy such technologies more widely. _“For successful use, we need an overview of energy consumption on the farm, appropriate geological data and, above all, balanced use for heating and cooling. Only in this way can the soil serve as an effective heat and cold storage,”_ added Jorg Prestor from the Geological Survey. Part of the output of the study is a model for assessing the economic viability of geothermal-based cold storage, as well as the first technological guidance for the use of shallow geothermal energy for Slovenian cold storage facilities. _“We found that the potential exists, but the solutions cannot be standard. This is now a matter for the competent ministry and the interests of farmers, who need guidelines,”_ concluded Rman. **[RELATED: Himachal Pradesh, India to set up geothermal controlled atmosphere storage](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/himachal-pradesh-india-to-set-up-geothermal-controlled-atmosphere-storage/)**",

    "content": "The city of Cascade, Idaho is evaluating the feasibility of a networked geothermal heating and cooling system to serve its residents and businesses. The city of Cascade, Idaho is currently conducting a feasibility study on the use of geothermal for district heating and cooling, potentially lowering energy costs by 66% for homes and businesses connected to the geothermal system. The [**“Geothermal Heating and Cooling District Planning Project”**](https://cascadeid.us/city-government/geothermal-exploration/) aims to investigate the feasibility of a heating and cooling district, determine the footprint and design for the district, identify potential users, identify workforce development and training needs related to the district, develop a financial plan/cost estimate, and estimate the costs and benefits for interested customers. The project has received a USD 200,000 grant from the US Department of Energy and another USD 100,000 from the Idaho Office of Energy and Minerals. The study is expected to be completed by 2026. The proposed [geothermal heating and cooling](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/us-doe-publishes-report-on-commercial-liftoff-of-geothermal-heating-and-cooling/) network will be supplied by seven existing geothermal wells in the city. Two of these wells have been providing heat to the Cascade Schools and the Cascade Aquatic & Recreation Center for more than 15 years. The other wells are currently not in use. One of the wells is owned by the city, while the others are privately owned. The project will involve an assessment of the capacities of the wells, and a study on the number of customers who would be interested in buying into the system. A design and cost estimate for the system will then be created. If Cascade decides to move forward with the project, the city will have to construct distribution lines to homes and businesses. The current grant will not cover this phase of the project. The city instead intends to pursue new grants and could consider a bond to construct the system. No funding source has been finalized yet. As for the end-users, customers would have to connect to the distribution network and install their own heat pumps. The city officials noted that there are several incentives available to customers to help with the costs of heat pump installation. Both the federal government and Idaho Power offer incentives applicable to geothermal heating. City engineer Trevor Howard said that most of these incentives are capped at 50% to 70% of the total cost. Howard further noted that investing on a geothermal heat pump is worth the long-term savings compared to existing heating technologies. _“Heating and cooling with geothermal heat pumps costs about a third of the cost of electricity or propane heat,”_ Howard said.",

[The drilling of this well](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/early-drilling-indicate-opportunity-for-geothermal-heating-in-budapest-hungary/) was reported back in 2018. The heat will then be supplied to the public users of the district heating network in Zugló. During the opening ceremony, Mayor Gergely Karácsony emphasized that Budapest remains afflicted by outdated heating technologies. However, the city is blessed with a large reservoir of geothermal energy which the local governments aims to use for district heating in the coming years. This way, Budapest can break away from energy dependencies and a heat supply that is unsustainable in the long term, whether in the context of climate or energy security.",

    "content": "Quaise Energy demonstrated its advanced drilling technology in Texas, a step closer to global clean geothermal energy. Quaise Energy has showcased a significant milestone in its mission to harness geothermal energy worldwide. By demonstrating its advanced drilling technology on a full-scale oil rig in Texas, the company aims to unlock superhot, superdeep geothermal resources as a clean and reliable energy source. Here’s a closer look at the demonstration and the next steps in Quaise’s journey. The company, formed only seven years ago, is on track to prove that clean, renewable geothermal energy could power the world, according to Carlos Araque, CEO of [Quaise](https://www.quaise.energy/) and a co-founder. “Geothermal energy is available everywhere on massive scales,” said Araque. “If you take all fossil, all nuclear, and all other forms of renewable energy combined, they’re not even a millionth of a millionth of the thermal stores of energy” below the Earth’s surface. “It’s mind-boggling, and to get it, we only have to go down two to twelve miles. That’s how close we are to infinite clean energy no matter where you are in the world.” Araque was speaking on May 21 at the first demonstration of the company’s drilling technology at a full-scale oil rig owned by Nabors, one of the world’s largest oil-and-gas drilling companies. Among the approximately 50 attendees, who included reporters, potential investors, and even potential Quaise customers, was William Restrepo, CFO of [Nabors](https://www.nabors.com/our-company/) and a Quaise board member. Also on hand was Lauren Boyd, director of the [Geothermal Technologies Office at the U.S. Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/geothermal-technologies-office?nrg_redirect=267352). **Superhot, Superdeep** Geothermal energy–the heat beneath our feet–has been around for a long time, but it barely contributes to today’s energy mix. “That’s because the true geothermal resource, the one that matters, is not very accessible. Getting to it is beyond the economic reach of the conventional tool set of oil and gas,” said Araque. The [mother lode](https://www.quaise.energy/news/deep-geothermal-energy-lifes-origin-future) of geothermal energy is some two to 12 miles beneath the Earth’s surface where the rock is so hot that if water could be pumped to the area it would become supercritical, a steam-like phase that most people aren’t familiar with. (Familiar phases are liquid water, ice, and the vapor that makes clouds.) Supercritical water, in turn, can carry some 5-10 times more energy than regular hot water, making it an extremely efficient energy source if it could be pumped above ground to turbines that could convert it into electricity. Today we can’t access those resources, except in places like Iceland where they are relatively close to the surface. The number one problem: we can’t drill down far enough. The drills used by the oil and gas industries can’t withstand the formidable temperatures and pressures that are found miles down without becoming exponentially more expensive with depth. **Steady Progress** The May demo at the Nabors facility is only the latest of many in what Araque calls an aggressive timeline to prove the technology. The ultimate goal, he said, is to provide a renewable source of energy on parity with oil and gas. “This is not a company built to develop a cool drilling gadget. We aim to become a geothermal developer. Our product is not a drill bit. Our product is clean heat and energy that is abundant, reliable and affordable on a global scale,” said Araque. The general technique behind the Quaise drilling approach was developed at [MIT over some 15 years](https://news.mit.edu/2022/quaise-energy-geothermal-0628). Scientists there showed that millimeter waves could indeed drill a hole in basalt (basalt and granite make up the majority of rock at great depth). This was promising in part because the gyrotron machine that produces the millimeter-wave energy is not new. It’s been used for some 70 years in research toward nuclear fusion as an energy source. Quaise has been developing the technique to drill deeper and deeper holes. The holes drilled at MIT were two inches in diameter by two inches deep. Outside the Quaise lab in Houston earlier this year, engineers succeeded in drilling a hole four inches in diameter and 10 feet deep ([see video](https://www.quaise.energy/news/from-lab-to-field-testing)). Andres Calabressi, Head of Manufacturing at Quaise, emceed the Quaise demonstration with a microphone to communicate over the steady rumble of powerful equipment. He explained that beginning in March, the company lowered columns of granite about nine inches in diameter into a conventionally drilled hole under the rig. Together those columns made a core some 80 feet long that sits inside a metal casing. The latter is outfitted with ports to monitor parameters like heat and pressure, data that allow the team to test recipes for optimal drilling. The Quaise engineers then integrated the [millimeter-wave technology](https://www.quaise.energy/news/millimeter-wave-drilling-the-key-to-clean-energy-abundance) with the rig. In the May 21 demo, they shot millimeter waves into the granite column, deepening a hole four inches in diameter that they’d already drilled to ten feet. (The next week, the team successfully drilled to 30 feet for the first time; the next goal on this phase of the work is 40 feet.) During the demonstration, Calabressi was flanked by three large flat screens showing different dimensions of the work. One tracked key parameters like rock temperature, while another showed a video close-up of the millimeter waves melting rock. (The latter was taken previously in the Quaise lab since those interactions were not visible at the Nabors rig.) Araque noted that the demo was “full scale in size, but not in power.” The gyrotron involved produced 100 kilowatts of power. “That’s a tenth of the power that will be commercially relevant, and is roughly equivalent to the power of the car you drove to this demonstration.” Next month, Quaise expects the delivery of a much larger gyrotron capable of producing one megawatt of power. “That is commercially relevant. We aim to get it to the field over the next two years,” Araque said. In the meantime, the company is preparing for another demonstration planned for July in Marble Falls, Texas. There, the team aims to drill multiple holes 130 meters (about 425 feet) deep into an actual granite outcrop for the first time. Henry Phan is Vice President of Engineering at Quaise. He explained that the Marble Falls rig will be smaller, “allowing us to be more nimble in terms of moving from one hole to another.” **Additional Advances** Quaise has also been tackling other [scientific and engineering challenges](https://www.quaise.energy/news/international-multidisciplinary-collaborations-key-to-bringing-superhot-clean-geothermal-energy-to-the-world-2) associated with harvesting the energy from superhot, superdeep rock. Trenton Cladouhos, vice president of geothermal resource development at Quaise, described several of those challenges and advances toward solving them in a talk the day before the Quaise demo at a recent geothermal event in Houston. Cladouhos said that Quaise is working with vendors and universities “to push them to consider higher and higher temperatures.” For example, last year a team at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédéral de Lausanne reported new insights into what happens when superhot, superdeep rock is exposed to water that can eventually transfer the rocks’ heat to the surface. The work, supported in part by Quaise, was published in the journal Nature Communications. It confirmed earlier modeling work also supported by Quaise. In addition, Cladouhos noted that Quaise has an in-house engineer who has been working on the design of superhot geothermal power plants. Earlier this year Senior Mechanical Engineer Daniel Dichter [reported insights to that end](https://www.quaise.energy/news/quaise-energy-reports-new-insights-into-designing-superhot-geothermal-plants) in two papers. **Toward the Future** Araque concluded his presentation at the demo by describing the company’s blueprint for developing a superhot, superdeep geothermal resource available around the globe. It involves dividing the world into three tiers based on geothermal gradient, or how close the resource is to the surface. Tier 1, for example, will focus on relatively accessible superhot rock. This means that the first Quaise power plant will probably be located in the American West, perhaps near the Newberry Volcano site in Oregon. Newberry has a long history of geothermal exploration. Although still a ways off, Tier III sites, which will involve drilling as much as 12 miles down, “hold the key to making superhot geothermal a truly global energy source,” according to this [Quaise video](https://www.quaise.energy/news/tiers-of-development). “Tier III sites could provide power to more than 90% of humanity.” **Superhot Team** Araque described Quaise’s goal of unlocking superhot, superdeep energy for the world as “a moonshot. But it is not a moonshot.” The people working to “pioneer this transformative approach to clean energy have transitioned from careers in oil, gas, nuclear fission, and nuclear fusion,” and all have histories of achievement. For example, several were involved in the invention and development of [Manara](https://www.slb.com/products-and-services/innovating-in-oil-and-gas/completions/well-completions/intelligent-completions/downhole-interval-control-valves/manara-electric-interval-control-valves), a production and reservoir management solution developed at Schlumberger to substantially increase the recovery of oil from complex production systems. And among them, Quaise team members hold several patents. “So I’m confident that together we can make this work,” Araque concludes.",

    "content": "Modular designs, machine learning, and real-time performance monitoring are helping to tackle the challenges of ESP technology in geothermal settings. _Electrical submersible pump (ESP) technology has played a big role in expanding the utilization of geothermal resources worldwide, particularly for direct heating applications. However, the extreme conditions of geothermal environments introduce challenges to ESP design and operations. Efficiency, operations, and maintenance factors also have to be considered to maximize the economics of geothermal projects involving ESPs._ _In this guest article written by Hans Sjerps, Frank Corredor, Juan Pablo Atencia, and Alasdair McPhail, we go over the many common technical challenges of ESP operations and how[Halliburton](https://www.halliburton.com/) addresses these through tailor-made solutions._ In the 1990s, geothermal operators discovered the benefits of electric submersible pumps (ESPs), an artificial lift technology, for geothermal water extraction. These pumps, tried and proven in the oilfield to maximize hydrocarbon extraction, drew upon established techniques to remove subsurface fluids, which made them attractive to smaller-scale operations such as local heating networks and wellness baths. As geothermal operators pushed the limits of traditional applications and began exploring deeper depths, ESP use expanded to handle more significant outputs of up to 150 liters per second and withstand temperatures of 150°C. However, traditional ESPs hit their limits in geothermal applications. Extreme temperatures, corrosive brines, and strenuous operating conditions pose challenges and require operators to seek hardier solutions. The fluid extracted from geothermal wells lacks oil, which affects lubrication. Limestone-derived calcium carbonates could also cause scaling in essential pump and seal areas. While traditional high-flow ESP pumps perform well in standard water lifting, they risk potential failure under these intense geothermal conditions. In seasonal temperature changes, motor bearings and power connectors may experience even more stress that could cause failure. The geothermal industry originally adapted bolted bowl-type pumps, which originated from shallow cold water lifting applications. However, their limitations and safety concerns meant the industry required a new solution to withstand the demands of deep-set geothermal applications. Otherwise, operators could experience equipment failures due to the pressure, temperature, and vibrations inherent in geothermal wells. A notable incident with a customer in Europe highlighted the risks inherent in bolted bowl-type pumps. When a pump failed on site, the operator lost equipment downhole. Upon further inspection, the operator discovered vibrations due to the pressure in the well dislodging the downhole-facing bolts and cracking the bowls due to metal fatigue. This underscored the dangers of using pumps not designed for the conditions of deep geothermal wells. Geothermal projects require the utmost efficiency to help ensure a return on investment. However, traditional geothermal systems often use technology better suited to the oilfield, which results in less efficiency. For example, conventional geothermal systems use round power cables to maintain balanced electromagnetic fields, which prolongs submersible motors’ longevity and efficiency. However, these round cables occupy double the space compared to flat cables. With a frequency controller integrated into the ESP to correct imbalances caused by flat cables, operators can optimize the space and save power, reducing costs. Thermal cycling and scale resistance also increase costs for geothermal operators during geothermal fluid extraction. Traditional pump inlets often obstruct fluid movement, which results in cavitation and scale formation due to pressure drops. A larger inflow area for ESPs than standard intakes can address the issue of high flow rates in small casing sizes and help lower costs. Another way to reduce costs involves the reduction of the lifting requirement. Traditional intake design requires up to 50 kW more power to lift and meet high geothermal flow demands. However, a reduction of 2-bars at a flow rate of 400 m3/h (111 L/s necessitates 45 kW less lifting power applied at the surface. Calculated at €0.30 per kWh over a year, this equates to about €128,000 saved per year. In addition, geothermal operations encompass power generation and [direct heating,](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/french-cities-to-expand-geothermal-district-heating-network/) which demand versatile flow rates with seasonal variations in heat demand. Operators could reduce costs through a device integrated into the ESP that fine-tunes motor settings to suit load condition fluctuations, a capability beyond the reach of conventional frequency drive controllers. Field trials for these devices demonstrated up to 50 kW in achieved power savings for a 1650 HP motor at 40 Hz, compared to the maximum speed of 60 Hz, which translates to an estimated annual power cost reduction of around €130,000. Project economics, pump performance, and overall operation uptime benefit from real-time observation. They allow operators to detect abnormal events early to prevent a shutdown. SCADA platforms for real-time monitoring must include high-resolution data collection, visualization dashboards, key performance indicator measurement, and remote controls within a 24/7/365 cloud-based environment to ensure that data remains available and secured via private VPN-encrypted communications. The cloud-based environment facilitates monitoring and management regardless of location and/or mobile device. Without these features, operators will fall short of their objectives and cannot enable continuous real-time monitoring and management of geothermal plants and ESP systems. Machine learning algorithms and techniques further enhance ESP operations. They serve as advanced engineering tools for baseline conditions related to flow, pressure, and temperature that elevate the online platform’s data comparison features. Through these data analysis and processing advancements, the geothermal industry can now use pump performance tracking and well inflow performance monitoring. It also allows the establishment of power consumption benchmarks and prevents electromechanical anomalies. Furthermore, machine learning provides virtual parameters with less than 5% error margins compared to actual downhole gauges. Virtual sensors, combined with the physical sensor downhole, could, for example, detect a pump inlet plugging to schedule maintenance. The virtual sensors can take over for data reporting to the mining authorities without the need to pull a still-running pumping system in case the physical sensor fails. Dedicated surveillance engineers perform data analysis, pump health assessments, and ESP trend analysis within the platform. They base their analysis on a geothermal plant-specific operations playbook of best practices and historical events, which allows for the consistent execution of technical recommendations and the preservation of system integrity for operational scenarios. The collaborative efforts between operators and monitoring services, supported by digital and analytical tools, extend the operational runtime of ESPs. To meet the challenges of harsh geothermal environments, operators require ESPs that can withstand the demands of deep geothermal wells and tackle issues such as lubrication, scaling, and thermal stress. When [Halliburton](https://www.halliburton.com/) engineers developed the [GeoESP® pump system](https://www.halliburton.com/en/resources/geoesp-brochure), they began with a framework that accounted for geothermal environments and prioritized safety, flexibility, and efficiency. The GeoESP system emerged as a versatile, modular, and robust technology suite that consists of the GeoESP pump and related components: the GeoESP intake, GeoESP box test container, GeoController® surface package, and GeoESP skid. These modules work with the Intelevate™ digital platform to help operators adapt to various geothermal environments, maximize geothermal water extraction, and minimize input power costs. From its inception, engineers designed the GeoESP pump to help overcome the limitations and safety issues associated with the bolted-bowl pumps commonly used in the water-lifting industry. The redesign includes additional housing for the bowls to prevent lateral movements from long tubing risers that could lead to metal fatigue, which results in dislodged bolts. The pump housings can withstand differential pressures up to 193 bar—far beyond the requirements of geothermal applications. Moreover, flanged connections with upward-facing bolts with a centralizer ring secure the pump stages, reducing the risk of loose bolts. Because engineers designed the GeoESP system as a modular solution, operators can use pre-defined configurations with five, seven, 11, or 14 pump stages to handle flow rates from 20 to 160 liters per second. The standard outer diameter of 9.5 inches grants the GeoESP system the adaptability to handle various well inflow conditions. It simplifies the adaptation process at the well site for a range of flow rates and lifting requirements. It also ensures compatibility with a single set of centralizers for all pump configurations. For customers with multiple wells, standardization also helps them reduce the amount of inventory to a single GeoESP system. Halliburton builds GeoESP system components with high-quality, heat-resistant (150-250?C, 303-482?F BHT) materials that resist scale, corrosion, and abrasion with additional new and innovative technologies to address the unique demands of geothermal applications. These modular components enhance safety and reduce power input costs, as well as improve efficiency at geothermal well sites: * **GeoESP intake:** deep set ESPs must handle high flow rates from small casing diameters, but small intake sizes can pose a challenge. In addition, traditional pump inlets often obstruct fluid movement, which may lead to cavitation and scale formation due to pressure drops. The GeoESP intake, an easy-to-change, interchangeable, modular pump intake, drew inspiration from cross-industry designs like medical technology. The system boasts a 500% larger inflow area than standard intakes, with pressure loss reductions by over 30% for flow rates of around 10 liters per second. It features a screened housing to protect against small-sized solids and debris. Optimized inflow geometry reduces pressure drop for increased energy savings and further mitigates the development of scale and casing erosion around the pump inlet. * **GeoESP box test container:** A simple, 2000 kVA plug-and-play surface solution for inflow performance tests helps operators save time and money. The GeoESP box test container can also be used as a final, long-term solution that could save well costs related to surface plant construction, project engineering, and time to operation. * **GeoController surface package:** Geothermal operations encompass power generation and direct heating. The operations demand versatile flow rates due to seasonal variations in heat demand. The GeoESP system now includes the GeoController surface package. This device fine-tunes the GeoESP motor settings to suit load condition fluctuations, a capability beyond the reach of conventional frequency drive controllers. Field trials demonstrated that the GeoController surface package can achieve up to 50 kW in power savings for a 1650HP motor at 40Hz, compared to the maximum speed of 60Hz. This translates to an estimated annual power cost reduction of €130,000. The GeoController surface package facilitates seamless communication between various systems, with efficient data processing, real-time sensor monitoring, and remote interventions for advanced GeoESP operations, protections, and optimized power consumption. * **GeoESP skid:** Designed to increase the safety and speed of ESP execution, the GeoESP skid safeguards GeoESP equipment amid storage, transportation, and well-site preparation. It resists bending and impact, and provides safer built-in design features. The GeoESP skid helps the ESP arrive at the well-site ready for assembly and decreases the personnel required to handle and lift. One person can prepare rig-up without a forklift or crane for additional assistance. The GeoESP skid simplifies long-term storage through its stackability, ability to enable oil flushing, and leakage control. The proof of the efficacy of designed artificial lift equipment – in particular, the GeoESP system – lies in how much operators save when they avoid preventable losses due to unsuitable pumps. For example, one German geothermal operator relied on two ESPs to extract water but transitioned to a single GeoESP system with a broader operational range. While the engineer evaluated the equipment for installation, the engineer identified unrepairable power quality issues in the low-voltage variable-speed drive (VSD) output, which would result in six months of downtime while they waited for new equipment. Not only would this downtime affect costs, but it would also potentially leave thousands of Germans without heat. However, the operator installed a GeoESP box test container, which provided a seamless surface solution amid the VSD replacement process. The GeoESP box test container can adapt to different grid voltages throughout Europe and support the geothermal plant while the team replaces the VSD. The GeoController surface package provided the operator with a quick, easy interface for field service and connected to the Intelevate digital platform, which allowed them to analyze real-time data from a mobile phone. This expedited deployment of the box test container averted a potential loss of over €1.5 million in downtime and associated costs. In another scenario, a geothermal operator experienced three ESP failures within 60 days due to scale accumulation, which led to seized systems and broken shafts. The financial impact of such failures could have escalated to €500,000, which included pull expenses, equipment replacement, and operational downtime. The introduction of a GeoESP intake and system monitoring via the Intelevate platform allowed for early detection of scale formation. The operator implemented suggested preventative measures, extended the run time, and enhanced the operation’s overall efficiency, which resulted in cost savings. As more governments and consumers look to geothermal as a cost-effective, reliable power source, the ability to keep costs down and continue operations will boost the industry. Artificial lift solutions tailored to geothermal applications, such as the GeoESP system, help operators unlock geothermal’s full potential, increase safety and efficiency, and reduce costs.

    "content": "Indonesia is intensifying efforts to develop geothermal power in Maluku, with PT PLN instructed to fast-track activities on the Tulehu and Wapsalit sites. Indonesia’s [Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources](https://www.esdm.go.id/en) (ESDM), Bahlil Lahadalia, has instructed state-owned electricity company PT PLN to expeditiously build a geothermal power plant in the Maluku region, citing the need for the region to not be completely dependent on diesel and coal. According to Bahlil, the 40-MW geothermal power development in Maluku has now been included in the draft of PT PLNs’ 2025-2034 Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL). There are two project sites being targeted – the 20-MW Wapsalit geothermal site in Buru Island, and the 2×10 MW Tulehu geothermal site in the Ambon Island. _“So when there are old generating machines, which are diesel, they are immediately replaced with Renewable Energy (EBT), as a form of the Government’s concern to provide EBT as an international consensus,”_ said Bahlil. Based on 2024 data, the total power generation capacity in the Maluku region has reached 409 MW. About 249 MW of this comes from diesel power plants, followed by gas-based power plants at 157 MW. The contribution of renewables, via solar and hydroelectric power plants, is minimal at only 3 MW. _“With the inclusion of the geothermal power plant (PLTP) project into the RUPTL of PT PLN, the Government wants to significantly boost the use of New and Renewable Energy in the Maluku region and reduce the dominance of fossil energy which has so far dominated the electricity system in the region,”_ added Bahlil. The Wapsalit prospect is currently in the exploration stage and has an expected COD by 2028. Tulehu, on the other hand, is a site that has had a long history of [surface surveys and exploration drilling,](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/exploration-started-on-first-20-mw-phase-of-tulehu-geothermal-project-by-pln-in-maluku-indonesia/) with results from the wells decidedly not meeting the expectations for the project.",

    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "10 Jun 2025",
    "content": "The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources of Indonesia is drafting a regulation to establish a framework for direct use applications of geothermal energy. Indonesia’s [Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources](https://www.esdm.go.id/en) (MEMR) through the [Directorate General of New, Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation](https://ebtke.esdm.go.id/) (EBTKE) has started working on a draft regulation for direct use applications of geothermal resources. The Guidelines for Geothermal Management for Direct Utilization aims to promote geothermal not only as a source for electricity generation, but as an enabler for tourism, agribusiness, and industry. This can help strengthen local economies, and encourage the growth of ecotourism and micro, small, and medium enterprises within the host communities of geothermal projects. However, such an industry still requires strong regulatory support to prosper. _“Direct utilization of geothermal energy is the new face of the clean energy sector that is oriented towards people’s welfare and environmental sustainability,”_ said Eniya Listiana Dewi, Director General of EBTKE. _“More than just a provider of clean energy, geothermal energy opens up opportunities for business and industrial innovation—from green hydrogen production, high-value mineral extraction, to geothermal-based ecotourism development.”_ Eniya further explained that the planned regulation aims to establish a process for direct utilization of geothermal energy. This process will include the issuance of operation feasibility, guidance and supervision, resource conservation, and regulation of geothermal energy prices for direct utilization. The MEMR has so far conducted a public consultation on the draft regulation to gather input from local government, geothermal associations, academics, business entities, and other relevant stakeholders. Direct use applications of geothermal energy in Indonesia currently remain at pilot project scale. A noteworthy example is [the coffee drying facility in Kamojang,](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/pioneering-geothermal-use-for-coffee-production-in-kamojang-indonesia/) which has helped create a more sustainable and efficient business ecosystem for local coffee entrepreneurs. _“This is in line with the Government’s efforts to promote a new paradigm, namely Sustainable Geothermal Development. An approach that emphasizes a balance between economic, social, and environmental benefits, and is in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),”_ further added Eniya.",

    "date": "12 Aug 2025",
    "content": "The British Geological Survey has published a freely available online platform that summarizes geothermal potential using different technologies across the UK. The [British Geological Survey](https://www.bgs.ac.uk/) has launched the **[UK Geothermal Platform](https://ukgeothermalplatform.org/)** , an online, interactive and freely available platform that provides information on geothermal potential in the UK, both for shallow and deep technology options. The map explorer is a user-friendly interface for visualising and examining spatial summary and data layers. There are summary layers for: * [shallow, vertical closed loops with ground-source heat pump](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/pension-fund-invests-in-geothermal-heat-pump-network-in-south-wales-uk/) * shallow, open loops with ground-source heat pump * deep, hot, sedimentary aquifers (hydrothermal) * deep, engineered geothermal systems in granites (petrothermal) The summary layers provide information on geothermal energy potential, including indications of thermal output, temperature and cost information based on the study [“UK geothermal energy review and cost estimations” (Arup, 2025).](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-geothermal-energy-review-and-cost-estimations) Such information is valuable for regulators, developers, and researchers looking into developing geothermal systems. For instance, the platform highlights that closed-loop systems can technically be deployed almost anywhere across Great Britain (local planning and regulatory constraints apply). Up to 55% of the population has the potential to extract up to 15000 kWh of thermal energy (the typical annual energy of a gas boiler), via a single, 150 m-deep, closed-loop system. Towns, cities and industrial sites can be assessed for the potential to retrofit geothermal technology and new development zones can be quickly assessed for strategic use of geothermal energy from the start of the development or planning cycle. For example, planned development for the Liverpool–Manchester–Leeds–Sheffield growth corridor can take advantage of multiple geothermal energy technologies. The openly available platform features a user-friendly map explorer and a data access page that also enables you to view more detailed geoscientific information from several organisations, including BGS, the Mining Remediation Authority, environmental agencies, the North Sea Transition Authority and the UK Onshore Geophysical Library. The first release of the UK Geothermal Platform has been funded by the UK Government’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) through the Net Zero Innovation Portfolio. It is delivered and maintained by BGS. _“For the first time, the UK Geothermal Platform makes a large volume of national-scale geothermal data and information available and digitally accessible,”_ commented Dr Alison Monaghan, head of geothermal at BGS. _“It supports a wide range of users in understanding at high level the potential for a range of geothermal energy options, supporting decarbonisation of heating and energy security.”_",

    "date": "14 Aug 2025",
    "content": "Tech company AirJoule has signed an agreement with the city of Hubbard, Texas to deploy their air-to-water technology using low-grade heat from geothermal. The technology of AirJoule uses a proprietary metal organic frameworks (MOF) coating to capture water from air. Unlike conventional systems, AirJoule eliminates the need for harmful refrigerants and works in both humid and arid environments. The company has partnered with the GE Vernova Advanced Research Center in Niskayuna, New York, which confirmed that the process can produce PFAS-free distilled water. _“This project highlights an important application of our AirJoule ® platform: the ability to unleash the power of water from air by using low-grade waste heat to produce high-value distilled water from the air at the point of use,”_ said Matt Jore, CEO of AirJoule Technologies. _“While this project uses geothermal heat, the same platform can use waste heat from manufacturing operations and energy production infrastructure—unlocking a distributed and sustainable water solution for industry.”_ _“The City of Hubbard is proud to serve as the host for this project,”_ added Mary Alderman, the Mayor of Hubbard, TX. _“Like many communities in Texas and across the country, we’re facing growing concerns about water quality, aging infrastructure, and contamination. What’s so compelling about AirJoule ® is that it produces pure, distilled, PFAS-free water right at the source. We believe it can be part of the long-term solution for communities and industries that need clean water without compromise.”_ With a growing number of communities and industries in Texas facing structural water quality constraints, it is an important early market for AirJoule®. By generating water from air using any readily available low-grade waste heat, the AirJoule® platform offers a scalable and energy-efficient alternative that mitigates strain on groundwater and surface water resources. Interest in developing geothermal in Texas is growing, with companies like [Sage Geosystems](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/sage-expands-geothermal-collaboration-with-u-s-department-of-defense/), [Bedrock Energy](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/bedrock-energy-completes-inaugural-geothermal-hvac-project-in-austin-texas/), and [Exceed Geo Energy](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/exceed-geoenergy-signs-110-mw-geothermal-ppa-with-presidio-texas/) all working on early stage projects. In 2023, [a collaborative study headed by Project Innerspace](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/collaborative-study-highlights-the-growing-momentum-for-geothermal-energy-in-texas/) indicated that Texas is a prime area for geothermal development, in huge part because of the state’s rich oil and gas expertise.",

    "content": "A Japanese company has crafted technology to concentrate real hot spring water, making it possible to export the genuine Japanese onsen experience. Tokyo-based [Le Furo](https://le-furo.com/en/) is aiming to export the “onsen” hot spring experience outside of Japan to the rest of the world. This is done through their “Craft Onsen” project and a line of products derived from natural hot spring waters and minerals. As CEO Noaki Mita describes it, the products can be likened to espresso in that they are the concentrated components of real hot spring waters. This is unlike many commercially available “onsen powders” that mimic the relaxing color and scent of hot springs but are made of synthetic ingredients. Le Furo’s technology uses the natural minerals of hot spring sources, using a special method to make them soluble in water. The “Craft Onsen” products come in small bottles that can be poured into water to create a hot spring experience that feels like the real thing. The concentration is about 10,000 times that of natural hot spring water. The company is now seeking to expand their operations in the Gulf region, with the Craft Onsen products an essential part of brining the hot spring experience abroad. _“Here in Japan, we have this culture of soaking ourselves in a good, long bath to attain better health — that’s the kind of story that I believe (other countries) will show great interest in,”_ said Mita. Hot springs are a central part of both culture and tourism in Japan, with hot spring destinations having been in operations for multiple generations. For this reason, it is an important consideration for geothermal power plant developers. Places like Okuhida Onsengo showcase the possibility that [geothermal power operations and hot spring businesses can exist alongside each other](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/okuhida-onsengo-japan-showcases-co-existence-of-hot-springs-and-geothermal-power/), and even be in a mutually beneficial relationship.",

    "author": "Alexander Richter",
    "date": "7 May 2025",
    "content": "Ormat Technologies has acquired the Blue Mountain geothermal project in Nevada, strengthening its U.S. asset base and future development pipeline. In a strategic move to strengthen its domestic geothermal portfolio, Ormat Technologies Inc. has acquired the Blue Mountain geothermal project located in Humboldt County, Nevada. The acquisition was disclosed as part of Ormat’s Q1 2025 financial results, released on May 7, 2025. Ormat acquired the plant for USD 88 million, subject to standard working capital adjustments, as disclosed. The deal adds another U.S.-based geothermal asset to Ormat’s expanding footprint and aligns with its goal of increasing both capacity and development potential across core geothermal markets. _“We continued to execute our growth plans and strengthened our geothermal portfolio with the acquisition of the Blue Mountain project,”_ said Doron Blachar, CEO of Ormat Technologies, in a statement accompanying the earnings release. The Blue Mountain geothermal project, [previously operated by Nevada Geothermal Power Inc.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/nevada-geothermal-powers-blue-mountain-faulkner-1-plant-an-overview/) and later Alta, has a long-standing presence in the region but has struggled to reach its initial production targets. Located in a geothermally active zone in northwestern Nevada, the project is now set to benefit from Ormat’s technical capabilities and operational expertise. The plant was initially developed and owned by [Nevada Geothermal Power Inc.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/nevada-geothermal-powers-blue-mountain-faulkner-1-plant-an-overview/) (NGP) from its commissioning in October 2009 until 2013. It then transferred to EIG Global Energy Partners from 2013 to 2015. AltaRock Energy, through its yieldco Baseload Clean Energy Partners, acquired it in May 2015 and likely held it until around 2018-2019, when Cyrq Energy took over, based on operational records from 2019. Finally, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners acquired Cyrq Energy in March 2021, making them the current owner as of May 2025. The project has struggled to reach its initial production targets of 49 MW. The now 20 MW facility, located in Humboldt County, was built using Ormat technology, features an existing 51 MW interconnection capacity and a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with NV Energy (NVE) that expires at the end of 2029. Following the acquisition, so the release, Ormat plans to upgrade the power plant, increasing its capacity by 3.5 MW. Additionally, subject to permit and PPA approval, Ormat intends to add a 13 MW solar facility to support the plant’s auxiliaries. The acquisition is anticipated to close towards the end of the second quarter.Located in a geothermally active zone in northwestern Nevada, the project is now set to benefit from Ormat’s technical capabilities and operational expertise. Blue Mountain is expected to be integrated into Ormat’s development pipeline, potentially revitalizing the project with new exploration, drilling, and engineering work. The company did not provide details on immediate development timelines but cited the acquisition as a “strategic addition” that supports long-term growth. Ormat currently operates over 1 GW of geothermal and renewable energy capacity worldwide, with Nevada serving as a key hub for its U.S. geothermal operations. Other major projects in the state include McGinness Hills, Steamboat, Don A. Campbell, and Tuscarora. The Blue Mountain acquisition reinforces Ormat’s commitment to leveraging Nevada’s vast geothermal resources and existing infrastructure to scale clean, firm energy solutions. It also aligns with the company’s broader strategy to expand geothermal capacity by 100–130 MW by the end of 2026, as reiterated in its Q1 2025 outlook. The acquisition highlights the increasing consolidation and revitalization of underutilized geothermal assets by experienced operators. Ormat’s involvement may signal a new chapter for Blue Mountain, potentially unlocking value through reservoir optimization and updated technology. It also reflects continued momentum for geothermal in the western U.S., where state-level decarbonization targets and federal incentives are driving interest in firm renewable power.",

    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "28 May 2025",
    "content": "A fertilizer developed by PGE and UGM from silica, a byproduct of geothermal power production in Indonesia, is improving crop quality of local farmers. While geothermal energy has long been known as a clean electricity source, it turns out that it can also produce by-products with great potential for other sectors—agriculture being one of them. Recognizing this opportunity, [PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy Tbk](https://www.pge.pertamina.com/) (PGE) (IDX: PGEO) collaborated with [Gadjah Mada University](https://geologi.ugm.ac.id/) (UGM) to process silica—a geothermal by-product—into [the Katrili booster](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/pertamina-and-ugm-develop-geothermal-nanosilica-fertilizer/), a local innovation that could become a beacon of hope for sustainable agriculture in Indonesia. _“PGE is committed to delivering real benefits to communities, especially those living around our operational areas. In Lahendong, where many residents depend on farming for their livelihoods, we saw an opportunity to optimize geothermal potential into something more impactful. This is what drove our collaboration with UGM in developing the use of silica, a geothermal by-product, into the Katrili booster,”_ said PGE Lahendong Area General Manager Novi Purwono. The partnership between PGE and UGM has been ongoing for years, even before PGE officially became a company and was still known as Pertamina Divis Geothermal (Pertamina Geothermal Division). The innovation behind the Katrili booster began unintentionally during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when a Geothermal Expert of the UGM Geological Engineering Department, Ir. Pri Utami, M.Sc., Ph.D., IPM, visited PGE’s Geothermal Working Area (WKP) and took samples of geothermal production outputs for laboratory testing._“After analyzing the samples, I found they contained a wealth of materials. Silica was the main one, but there were also many other minerals. Its properties resembled volcanic ash. That’s when I thought, why not turn it into fertilizer?”_ said Pri Utami. She later reached out to her colleague from the Faculty of Pharmacy UGM, Dr.rer.nat. Ronny Martien, a nanotechnology expert, to help transform the white silica powder into a plant-friendly booster. After in-depth research and successful development of the Katrili booster, UGM and PGE began engaging farmers using a participatory and voluntary approach. PGE also provided training and support for farmers. _“Katrili booster is new for most farmers because it works differently from the boosters, fertilizers, or pesticides they are used to. That’s why knowledge and skills transfer is crucial for proper and effective use. Like medicine, if used incorrectly, it won’t work as intended,”_ said Dr. Ngadisih, a soil and water conservation engineer from the Faculty of Agricultural Technology UGM. Beyond Lahendong, the Katrili booster has also been introduced through UGM students’ Community Service Programs (KKN) in several regions in Java, including Wonosobo and Magelang. In addition to silica, the Katrili booster contains chitosan derived from shrimp and crab shell waste—chosen for its abundance in Indonesia. Using this waste not only reduces trash but also offers added benefits to crops through its chitosan content. _“When combined with silica, chitosan coats the plant surface, making it more resistant to pests and better at retaining water. Meanwhile, silica strengthens the structure of plant cell walls,”_ said Pri Utami. Katrili booster is applied by mixing it with water and pouring it directly onto the soil. Dosages vary depending on soil characteristics and crop type. It has been used on various crops, such as Gustavi tomato varieties, batik peanuts, shallots, and rice. Two farmers from Tonsewer Village, Minahasa—Rommie and Danni—have personally experienced the benefits. They began using the booster in 2024 on their tomato crops._“In terms of quality, the crops treated with Katrili booster were clearly superior to those using only chemical fertilizers. The fruits were larger and more resilient. Ripening was more consistent, with a much lower risk of rotting. The plants also withstood extreme weather better, especially when combined with chemical fertilizers,”_ said Danni. Rommie and Danni expressed pride and gratitude for being able to use a booster developed from their homeland. The name Katrili is inspired by a traditional Minahasan dance that symbolizes gratitude and harmony. Rommie said, _“We’re very grateful for this PGE program. We hope it continues so that more farmers can benefit from it. After all, the output from our agricultural work helps many others.”_",

    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "23 May 2025",
    "content": "Drilling of the first exploration geothermal well in Tenerife, Canary Islands will begin by the coming fall, through a partnership of Icelandic and local organizations. Geothermal drilling will be carried out for the first in the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands beginning the coming fall. The project will be executed by Energía Geotérmica de Canarias (EGC), a company formed by Icelandic company [Reykjavík Geothermal](https://rg.is/), together with the energy company DISA, the largest company in the Canary Islands, and the government of Tenerife through the public companies Technological Institute and Renewable Energies ([Instituto Tecnológico y Energías Renovables](https://www.iter.es/) / ITER) and the Canary Islands Volcanological Institute ([Involcan)](https://involcan.org/involcan-2/). The formal establishment of the EGC took place with a signing ceremony in Santa Cruz, Tenerife held on the 23rd of May 2025. The boreholes will be drilled to depths of between 2500 to 3000 meters, with the objective of confirming the viability of using geothermal energy in the island as clean, stable, and local energy source. Geothermal exploration licenses were awarded to EGC and ITER following a tender in late 2024. Exploration drilling of several sites in western and southern Tenerife was then[ approved by the Government of the Canary Islands ](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/canary-islands-government-approves-geothermal-exploration-drilling-in-tenerife/)earlier this year. Notably, geothermal exploration licenses in La Palma [were also awarded to EGC at the same tender round.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-exploration-contracts-in-canary-islands-awarded-to-nine-entities/) Geothermal exploration takes place in the context of the island’s increasingly urgent need for sustainable and affordable energy. Today, over 80% of Tenerife’s electricity production comes from imported oil. Such an arrangement is both environmentally harmful and extremely expensive, and the Spanish state has to subsidize the energy costs for the island’s inhabitants and, indeed, for all of the Canary Islands. Since it is neither possible to harness hydroelectric power on the island nor is there room to build more large wind and solar power plants, which take up about ten times more land space than comparable geothermal power plants, the use of geothermal energy is gaining increasing importance in the future plans of the island’s authorities. Surface surveys carried out in 2024 showed promising indications of geothermal energy in the southern and western parts of the island. Final administrative authorization from the Canary Islands authorities is now awaited to begin drilling, but the drilling project has already been put out to tender. If the drilling proves successful, it is expected that the development of geothermal power plants could become an important addition to Tenerife’s energy supply, contributing to the energy exchange on the island and thus significantly reducing the use of imported oil. Reykjavík Geothermal is joining the project as both owner and technical leader. The company has [extensive experience](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/kaust-and-taqa-break-ground-on-geothermal-research-well-in-saudi-arabia/) in developing geothermal projects [around the world](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/mt-princeton-to-work-with-icelandic-partners-for-colorado-geothermal-project/) and is now using that expertise to support the first step in utilizing geothermal energy in Tenerife. _“This project is based on the experience, knowledge and belief of us Icelanders in geothermal energy as a sustainable energy source, and could completely change the situation for energy production in Tenerife. The trust that our partners in the project place in us is a great recognition of Icelandic ingenuity and expertise in the field of geothermal energy and an honor for us,”_ says Magnús Ásbjörnsson, CEO of Reykjavik Geothermal.",

This comprehensive, 48-page publication, developed under the OECS Geothermal Energy: Capacity Building for Utilisation, Investment and Local Development ([GEOBUILD](https://oecs.int/en/geobuild)) Programme, details the current status of geothermal projects across the region, from [Dominica’s advanced 10-MW power plant development](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/dominica-pm-provides-update-on-construction-of-laudat-geothermal-power-plant/) scheduled for completion in December 2025 to emerging projects in four other Member States: [Grenada](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/grenada-geothermal-project-receives-further-funding-support-from-cbd-and-uk-fcdo/), [Saint Kitts and Nevis](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/nevis-geothermal-project-going-into-bidding-process-for-drilling/), [Saint Lucia](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/world-bank-to-support-geothermal-exploration-at-saint-lucia-caribbean/), and [St Vincent and the Grenadines](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/st-vincents-grenadines-officials-reassure-support-of-geothermal-project/). The booklet also addresses key aspects of geothermal development, including environmental benefits, economic advantages, and various technological approaches to geothermal power generation. _“This publication marks a significant milestone in our region’s journey toward energy security and sustainability as we place on record the journey towards geothermal energy development from the Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) context,”_ said Judith Ephraim, Programme Director, Sustainable Energy, of the OECS Commission. _“Whilst many islands have good potential for geothermal energy, the unique nature of geothermal and the circumstances of SIDS makes the development of geothermal though a worthwhile undertaking, one which needs strong commitment, strategy and partnerships. It is therefore important to understand the steps taken so far to build on the knowledge base for geothermal ? development on islands.”_ The publication of “**Power Below The Surface”** comes at a crucial moment as the OECS embarks on a Decade of Action for Sustainable Energy Development. This comprehensive synopsis underscores the exceptional promise of geothermal energy in the Eastern Caribbean, where volcanic geology creates ideal conditions for this renewable resource. “**Power Below the Surface** ” is available in both print and digital formats, with the [ _electronic version_](http://bit.ly/powerbelowthesurfaceflipbook) accessible at [ _www.oecs.int/geobuild_](http://www.oecs.int/geobuild).",

    "content": "Quaise Energy hosted a public demonstration of their millimeter wave drilling technology as the company tests it against increasingly challenging scenarios. Just a few months after [achieving a milestone of having drilled through 100 meters of granite](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/quaise-energy-achieves-100-meters-of-drilling-using-millimeter-wave-technology/), Quaise Energy hosted the first of several planned public demonstrations of their boundary-pushing millimeter wave geothermal drilling technology. Some 56 invited public observers gathered in Marble Falls in Texas to see the drilling process in action. For [Quaise Energy](https://www.quaise.energy/), this represents the latest entry in a series of progressively more challenging demonstrations of their technology. As Justin Lamb, Head of Operations recounted, “ _Last fall we started by drilling four feet into a granite core inside our Houston lab. Then we moved right outside the lab to drill ten feet into another granite core._ ” In May of this year, [the company drilled 40 feet (~12.2 meters) into a granite core](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/quaise-energy-demo-showcases-clean-geothermal-drilling/) on a full-scale oil rig just outside of Houston owned by Nabors. At the recent public demonstration, the observers were able to see the drilling process in action, including the real-time drilling data. They are also able to see and touch the samples of the ablated granite, which were effectively turned into grey ash. Most importantly, they were able to see down the drilled hole through a live video camera – the deepest borehole drilling using millimeter waves so far. The company is hosting six more public demonstrations the Marble Falls quarry over the next three months. There were also other notable observations made during the demo. The drilling rate reached a rate of up to five meters per hour, which the team described as “extremely fast.” Henry Phan, Vice President of Engineering at Quaise, explained that today’s commercial operations average a drilling rate of a tenth of a meter per hour through granite. He also, however, pointed out that the hole diameter at Marble Falls was 4 inches, while the actual goal for production borehole diameter should be 8.5 inches. According to CEO Carlos Araque, it aims to break its own drilling record by drilling ten times as deep, to one kilometer. This could take place within the next few months. The Quaise team continues to do additional tests to optimize specific parts of the process. _“We’ll experiment with various parameters to, for example, control how straight the hole is and see if we can go even faster,”_ said Emilie Williams, Test Group Manager at Quaise.",

    "content": "India has published its National Policy on Geothermal Energy, setting the framework for funding, permitting, and government support for geothermal projects. The [Ministry of New and Renewable Energy](https://mnre.gov.in/en/) (MNRE) of India has published the country’s first National Policy on Geothermal Energy, setting an initial framework for the exploration and development of its geothermal resources. The complete text of the National Policy on Geothermal Energy can be accessed [via this link](https://cdnbbsr.s3waas.gov.in/s3716e1b8c6cd17b771da77391355749f3/uploads/2025/09/202509152136711668.pdf). The publication of the policy follows a period of extensive consultation with stakeholders, as well as [the establishment of a Task Force](https://mnre.gov.in/en/notice/constitution-of-task-force-to-harness-geothermal-energy-in-india/) in 2024 to review the draft of the policy. The task force was composed mostly of representatives from various research institutes around India, with a few industry players. The new geothermal policy sets a vision of geothermal energy being one of the major pillars of India’s renewable energy landscape, and thus contributing greatly to the nation’s 2070 Net Zero Goal. In more specific terms, the goals of the policy include: * Improvement of research capabilities on geothermal energy including in the areas of exploration, drilling, reservoir management, power generation, and direct use applications * Collaboration between local Ministries, research institutes, and international geothermal development bodies to incorporate global best practices in exploration, resource assessment, and technology adoption * Deployment of geothermal heating and cooling solutions for buildings, agriculture, and industries * Promotion of advanced geothermal exploration involving deep and multilateral drilling and repurposing of abandoned wells * Establishment of a public-private ecosystem for long-term geothermal development * Capacity building and knowledge sharing The Geological Survey of India has already identified 381 hot springs in the country with surface temperatures ranging from 35°C to 89°C. Most of the geothermal resources in India fall within the medium to low heat enthalpy zone, with resource temperatures of 100°C to 180°C. There are a few higher-temperature sites, particularly within the Himalayan regions. Thus, the GSI has identified 10 geothermal provinces as follows: * Himalayan Geothermal Province; * Naga-Lusai; * Andaman Nicobar Islands; * Son-Narmada Tapi (SONATA); * West Coast; * Cambay Graben; * Aravalli; * Mahanadi; * Godavari; * South India Cratonic. Moreover, the GSI has identified 16 geothermal energy sites, which includes the Puga Valley in Ladakh [where drilling is already ongoing](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-drilling-resumes-for-puga-valley-geothermal-project-ladakh-india/). To facilitate knowledge sharing, the Ministry shall create a geothermal resource data repository which will also include oil and gas industry data on abandoned and existing oil wells, mineral identification, and drilling expertise. The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) Data Repository may be made available for utilization by eligible operators or developers for geothermal prospective analysis. The scope of the policy includes a wide spectrum of geothermal applications, from power production to [ground source heat pump applications](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/leh-airport-set-to-have-indias-largest-geothermal-space-conditioning-system/), direct use, and the extraction of minerals and other byproducts. Currently, 100% foreign direct investment is allowed in India for renewables. There will be preference given to indigenous technologies to reduce dependency on importation and encourage local innovation. The MNRE shall also prioritize the conversion of existing abandoned oil and gas wells for geothermal utilization through collaboration with the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG), the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), and oil companies. Joint ventures are welcome, particularly those between geothermal developers and oil and gas and mineral companies. The government may explore different financing mechanisms such as government-funded exploration, funding from donor organizations, or long-term loans from private and public financial institutions. Fiscal mechanism can also be considered to support geothermal development, such as import tax exemptions, tax holidays on geothermal projects, or property tax exemptions. Project developers may approach state governments for the allocation of potential geothermal zones, for which the appropriate government may grant exploration permits. The Ministry may coordinate with the MoPNG in case of overlap with existing oil fields. State governments may also allocate possible geothermal sites for exploration for 3 years, with possible extension of 2 years (in case of seasonal challenges, such as in the Himalayas region). The sites can then be allocated for further development and exploitation for up to 30 years, with provisional extension. To support the timely implementation of these projects, the Ministry shall facilitate a streamlined single-window support system. States shall designate an agency to facilitate the granting of permits and monitor the implementation of geothermal projects. This agency will act as a single window for all mandatory and statutory clearances required for setting up a geothermal project.",

A new white paper published by [Orcan Energy](https://www.orcan-energy.com/en/) examines the global potential for geothermal energy applications, the prevailing challenges to its wider adoption, the role that modular ORC technology plays in addressing these challenges. **[Click here to download the white paper, “Unlocking geothermal power: how modular ORC technology maximizes clean energy.”](https://www.orcan-energy.com/en/geothermal-white-paper-unlocking-geothermal-power-how-modular-orc-technology-maximizes-clean-energy.html)** The use of Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology for power plants has significantly expanded the possibilities for geothermal power generation. In contrast to steam turbines, ORCs can exploit smaller heat sources and lower temperature levels. It operates as a closed-loop process, allowing for 100% reinjection of geothermal fluids. Temperature levels for ORC applications typically range from 100 to 180 °C. ORC systems can be used for 100% power generation, or in scenarios where heating and power generation are coupled. Possible fluctuations in heating demand, whether seasonal or in the short-term, highlight the flexibility of modular systems. The white paper presents several case studies on the value of modular ORC systems in addressing challenges in geothermal energy such as adapting to fluctuating heat demand or optimizing heat utilization. Since modules can operate independently, they can adjust to changing heat demand without a large penalty in efficiency. Modular ORC systems can also be useful for different geothermal development models, such as wellhead generation. This is an excellent way to convert standalone or exploration wells into profitable assets. **[RELATED: Frutura converts excess geothermal heat to power with Orcan Energy technology](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/frutura-converts-excess-geothermal-heat-to-power-with-orcan-energy-technology/)**",

    "content": "Building on its work with Sage Geosystems, ABB highlights how advanced technologies and industry partnerships can unlock geothermal’s full global potential. Following the February 2025 announcement of its partnership with [Sage Geosystems](https://www.sagegeosystems.com/) on geopressured geothermal systems, [ABB](https://new.abb.com/power-generation/segments/geothermal-power) has shared further insights on how such collaborations can support the global scale-up of geothermal energy. In commentary by Vijay Rengaraju, Global Industry Business Manager for Power Generation at ABB Energy Industries, the company emphasizes geothermal’s potential role in addressing rapidly growing electricity demand – particularly from data centers, AI, and digital infrastructure. Read the original article: [Sage and ABB partner on developing geopressured geothermal systems](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/sage-and-abb-partner-on-developing-geopressured-geothermal-systems/) **The case for geothermal in the energy transition** While geothermal has long played a niche role, accounting for less than 1% of global power generation, new technologies and rising energy needs are shifting the equation. According to the IEA, geothermal could meet up to 15% of global electricity demand growth by 2050 – equivalent to 800 GW of additional capacity. Geothermal energy offers: * Baseload and grid-stabilizing power * Minimal greenhouse gas emissions * Applications beyond electricity, such as district heating and industrial use ABB believes that scaling geothermal is not just possible, but essential – particularly as energy-hungry sectors seek reliable, low-carbon supply options. **Technology transfer and digitalization** ABB’s work with Sage Geosystems exemplifies the role of strategic partnerships in unlocking complex geothermal systems. The two companies are collaborating to deploy ABB’s automation, electrification, and digital tools at geothermal sites, including those using Sage’s geopressured geothermal and energy storage technologies. Geopressured systems, which extract both thermal energy and pressure-driven flow, offer a new pathway for geothermal development in sedimentary basins. ABB’s broader contribution lies in its ability to transfer knowledge from other sectors—such as oil and gas, power, and industry – into geothermal. This includes: * Subsurface analysis and project design * Industrial automation and instrumentation * AI, digital twins, and cloud-based operations These capabilities are especially important for emerging geothermal technologies like engineered (EGS) and advanced geothermal systems (AGS), which depend on precise modeling, controls, and efficiency optimization. **Meeting future power demand – sustainably** The ABB–Sage partnership is part of a wider push to ensure that data centers and digital infrastructure adopt low-carbon energy solutions. In 2024, Sage signed a deal to supply Meta with up to 150 MW of geothermal baseload power, with first power expected by 2027. As ABB notes, meeting future power needs sustainably will require: * Significant public and private investment * Favorable permitting and policy conditions * Integrated solutions across the energy value chain ABB sees its role not only as a supplier of equipment, but as a technology partner helping the geothermal industry scale more efficiently and cost-effectively. **A collaborative energy future** “The new energy future will not build itself,” says Rengaraju. “But with the right partnerships, the right technology innovation and stable policy frameworks, we can unlock geothermal energy’s full potential.” By combining ABB’s technical expertise with the entrepreneurial innovation of companies like Sage Geosystems, the geothermal sector may be well-positioned to grow from niche to mainstream in the decades ahead.",

The**“Monitoring vegetation-geothermal interactions from space and airborne platforms”** project will receive just over NZD 1 million from a new funding round by the New Zealand Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Technology. Massey University will be leading the project alongside partners Victoria University of Wellington and IIT Bombay, India. It is being led by Associate Professor Gabor Kereszturi from the School of Agriculture and Environment, who is also involved in Volcanic Risk Solutions, the university’s leading volcano research centre. The project focuses on combining thermal (e.g. surface temperature), hyperspectral imaging (the analysis of light reflected from the Earth’s surface), and radar remote sensing (scattering of microwave signals from the Earth’s surface) to assess vegetation around geothermal areas, such as those around Taupo, Rotorua, and Bay of Plenty in the North Island of New Zealand. Plants near geothermal fields are highly sensitive to geothermal activity, particularly heat and toxic metals, which can be observed via equipment orbiting Earth. _“We live in a rapidly changing world where remote sensing techniques offer accessible and innovative solutions for monitoring our environment and making more informed decisions. In this exciting collaboration with NASA-JPL, our project ambitiously aims to roll out a new non-invasive, space-based tool to map geothermal systems across New Zealand and assess their “health” through plant activity. Better integration of different satellite data can unlock the potential to monitor not only geothermal fields, but also volcanic systems and environmental pollution,”_ said Dr Kereszturi. The project will utilise sensors and satellites already orbiting Earth. ECOSTRESS and EMIT sensors are on board of the International Space Station, while Sentinel-1 is one of the flagship satellites of the European Space Agency. All of these provide frequent measurements from space and are available for researchers to access. The project will develop the computing and processing capabilities needed to analyse data for geothermal exploration and monitoring. New Zealand is the first country to apply this method for geothermal monitoring, and if proven, the technique could ultimately be used to monitor geothermal systems around the world, complementing existing geophysical and geochemical methods. This innovative way of assessing geothermal system health opens the door for wider applications, such as evaluating a region’s potential for heat or power generation, detecting contaminants, and monitoring primary agriculture or flooding impacts. A key benefit of this work is its integration of earth observation technologies with Indigenous scientific frameworks, ensuring geothermal monitoring is both technologically advanced and adds further value to the NASA Surface Biology and Geology mission, while also being deeply rooted in Matauranga Maori. This collaboration will enhance the NASA Surface Biology and Geology mission while [supporting Maori in their environmental stewardship.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/maori-should-be-driving-force-for-geothermal-in-nz/) _“Our expertise in volcanic and earth science is unmatched in New Zealand. It is one of Massey’s key research strengths and this project is future focussed and shows the application of great science and several possibilities for future applications,”_ commented College of Sciences Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Ray Geor. _“The fact that we are the first in the world to do this research, and collaborate with NASA to do so, is a great achievement for not only the remote sensing scientific field but the areas that we traditionally research such as agriculture and the primary industries. We will be able to apply it to our own geothermal areas and this is a testament to the quality of the research we do at Massey.”_",

    "content": "Drilling of the Banska PGP-4 well in Szaflary, Poland has ended at 6103 meters depth, short of the 7000-meter target, due to several drilling challenges. The drilling of a geothermal borehole in the town of Szalfary in the Malopolska Province in Poland, has been officially ended at a depth of exactly 6103.2 meters. Though short of the target 7-kilometer depth, it was nevertheless an impressive effort to set a new record for the deepest geothermal borehole for heating. For now, that record is still held by t[he 6.4-kilometer well in Otaniemi, Finland.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/final-phase-launched-of-drilling-the-worlds-deepest-geothermal-heat-wells-in-otaniemi-finland/) Drilling work for the Banska PGP-4 well started in April 2023. By the end of that year, it was reported that [the well had already reached the 5000-meter mark.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-drilling-in-szaflary-poland-hits-5-km-depth-mark/) By then, it had also intersected a large reservoir with temperature of 120 °C. Work had to be stopped at a depth of around 5900 meters because the drill had reached a very hard rock formation, resulting in a very slow rate of penetration. The walls of the well had also started collapsing, which had to be repaired. More so, the top drive failed and the main cable broke at a depth of 6096 meters. [Drilling was resumed in July 2024.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/drilling-resumes-on-7-km-geothermal-well-in-szaflary-poland/) With these challenges in consideration, it was decided that drilling will be terminated before the target depth had been reached. According to the initial assessment, the 120 °C resource had the greatest potential to be used for geothermal heating for the Szaflary commune and nearby areas, including the city of Nowy Targ. The well had also fulfilled its purpose as a research tool, providing subsurface information at previously unknown depths. Tests will still have to be done to determine the temperature, productivity, and the physicochemical properties of the waters from the well. This information will be the basis for creating a model for the use of thermal waters in the entire Podhale region. Preparatory work for the construction of a 5.5-kilometer heating main is already ongoing. The plan is for the geothermal heat to be distributed from the heating plant in Banska Nizna. The commune is also applying for funding for the implementation of the second stage of the project, which will involve building the connection of the geothermal network to the individual users. Geothermal research and drilling in Szaflary will contribute greatly to the building momentum for geothermal heating in Poland. The country will soon have 11 geothermal heating plants operational, the latest ones being in [Turek](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-heating-plant-in-turek-poland-to-be-operational-by-2026/) and [Konin](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-heating-plant-in-konin-poland-targets-operation-in-current-heating-season/).",

    "date": "22 Jul 2025",
    "content": "Quaise Energy has achieved a major milestone of drilling 100 meters using their millimeter wave drilling technology being developed for superhot geothermal. Prior to 2025, millimeter wave drilling had only been demonstrated in the laboratory, with MIT’s early system drilling a hole just a few centimeters deep. While 100 meters is only a fraction of the commercial depth needed for the company’s first power plants, the granite drilled during the field test is the same type of hard rock that blankets the basement layer of the Earth’s crust. The company plans to build on this achievement with an upcoming gyrotron using 10x more power, with a target to complete a pilot power plant in the Western U.S. as early as 2028. _“Our progress this year has exceeded all expectations,”_ said Carlos Araque, CEO and President of Quaise Energy. _“We’re drilling faster and deeper at this point than anyone believed possible, proving that millimeter wave technology is the only tool capable of reaching the superhot rock needed for next-generation geothermal power. We are opening up a path to a new energy frontier.”_ A few months ago, the company held[ the first demonstration of its drilling technology at a full-scale oil rig](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/quaise-energy-demo-showcases-clean-geothermal-drilling/) owned by Nabors, one of the world’s largest oil-and-gas drilling companies. The company started drilling through ten feet of a granite column but have scaled up significantly since then. Quaise’s millimeter wave drilling system, developed after more than a decade of research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), harnesses a powerful gyrotron to ablate rock for the first time without any downhole hardware. Unlike conventional drill bits, which struggle with hard, hot, rocks like granite and basalt, millimeter wave technology allows access to superhot rock—around 752 degrees Fahrenheit (400?)—typically found deep within the Earth’s subsurface.",

Drilling has started for a doublet that will supply the future geothermal heating network of the towns of Dugny and Le Bourget in the department of Seine-Saint-Denis in France. The drilling operations is expected to last from July to October 2025. Meanwhile, construction of the heating plant has been ongoing since October 2024. Currently, four boilers have already been installed, which will be used for backup and emergency purposes. The pumps to distribute the water across the work will soon be installed. The heating plant is expected to be completed by December 2025. The geothermal heating project is being undertaken by [Dugny-Le Bourget Green Energy](https://energie-verte-dugny-lebourget.fr/) (Energie verte de Dugny – Le Bourget / EVDB), a wholly owned subsidiary of [Groupe Coriance](https://groupe-coriance.fr/), as part of a Public Service Concession contract. The EUR 55 million project is being supported by the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) with EUR 18 million, the Ile-de-France region with EUR 2.5 million, and by the Greater Paris Metropolis with another EUR 2.5 million. When completed, the 20-kilometer network will supply more than 9000 housing equivalents, including the Le Bourget airport.

    "content": "Star Energy Group has partnered with Veolia, combining their strengths to deliver large-scale geothermal heating projects in the UK. British energy company [Star Energy Group](https://www.starenergygroupplc.com/) has announced a partnership with French infrastructure company [Veolia](https://www.veolia.com/en) to jointly develop large-scale geothermal heating projects in the UK. The joint work is projected to include hydrogeological and seismic studies, simulation, and directional drilling using proven technology that already been deployed globally. The two companies will focus on leveraging geothermal resources to decarbonize district heating schemes, hospitals, campuses, commercial buildings, and industrial facilities. With heating accounting for nearly a third of the UK’s total energy consumption and over 40% of its carbon emissions, Star Energy said geothermal systems offered a long-term, cost-effective, and grid-resilient alternative to other low-carbon heating technologies. As a result of the lower electrical power needs of geothermal systems, they offer a solution insulated from power pricing and, in places where alternative electrified solutions like electrical heating or high power heat pumps are more difficult to connect due to insufficient grid capacity, they provide a low carbon alternative. This is also an important step in the company’s diversification strategy, leveraging its subsurface expertise to expand into geothermal energy. Star Energy is already involved in [delivering geothermal heating solutions to Southampton](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/star-energy-and-bring-energy-to-collaborate-on-geothermal-heating-in-southampton-uk/) in partnership with district heating network operator Bring Energy. In 2024, the company [secured a €25 million facility](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/star-energy-closes-e25-million-credit-facility-to-support-geothermal-growth/) to fund its geothermal initiatives both in the UK and in Croatia. Star Energy is also delivering multiple geothermal projects to NHS facilities. _“Star Energy is playing a key role in the UK’s transition to sustainable and predictable heat provision, and geothermal has an important role to play in the UK’s energy transition by providing a home-grown, predictable, renewable heat option for businesses and households, contributing to the Government’s 2050 net-zero ambitions,”_ said Ross Glover, CEO of Star Energy. _“We look forward to working with the Veolia teams, and developing new projects using our unique expertise, gained over decades in the energy sector. Through partnerships such as this, we fully expect our geothermal business to grow significantly as it delivers to customer requirements to secure and decarbonise their energy supply.”_ For Veolia, the collaboration would support its global ‘GreenUp’ strategy to reduce emissions and combat climate change. Through local subsidiaries, Veolia is[ currently involved in a geothermal heating project in Lodz, Poland](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/innargi-and-veolia-group-partner-for-geothermal-heating-in-lodz-poland/) in partnership with Innargi. **“** _Veolia has a proven track record of delivering carbon savings through district heating, and our plan is to increase the number of district heating schemes in the UK – aligned with our global GreenUp strategy. So we particularly welcome this new partnership that will be able to deliver significant carbon savings in a sector where delivery can be complex,”_ added John Abraham, COO, Industrial, Water, and Energy UK, Ireland, and Nordics at Veolia. _“We know that geothermal energy is attractive, both from an economical and emissions perspective, when compared to other renewable and fossil fuel solutions. By working together we will be able to deliver the significant benefits of low carbon heat that is needed across a wide range of domestic, commercial and public sector applications.”_",

    "content": "Tohoku Electric and Mitsubishi have partnered with Quaise Energy to explore deep geothermal drilling technology for zero-carbon energy development in Japan. Tohoku Electric Power and Mitsubishi Corporation are partnering with U.S.-based Quaise Energy to explore the use of deep geothermal drilling technology in Japan, aiming to tap into ultra-deep geothermal resources as part of the country’s long-term decarbonization strategy. The collaboration is backed by Japan’s [New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization](https://www.nedo.go.jp/activities/ZZJP_100198.html) (NEDO) under a multi-phase innovation program aimed at expanding domestic geothermal development. The project will assess the feasibility of Quaise’s gyrotron-based drilling technology, which uses high-frequency millimeter-wave energy to vaporize rock, enabling access to geothermal heat at depths of up to 10 km. Japan, with its high geothermal potential and deep drilling challenges, is seen as a key market for this emerging technology. Tohoku Electric aims to apply Quaise’s method to reach high-temperature heat zones previously considered inaccessible with conventional drilling methods. Mitsubishi Corporation, which recently [invested in Quaise](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/quaise-energy-secures-21-million-funding-to-support-field-operations/), will support commercialization efforts in Japan. The collaboration seeks to validate the technology’s applicability to Japan’s complex geology and integrate it into future power generation or heat supply infrastructure. The initiative aligns with Japan’s goal to increase geothermal utilization and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, especially in industrial and remote regions.

    "content": "The city of Regina in Saskatchewan, Canada has broken ground on an indoor aquatics facility that will feature geothermal heating from 2000 meters depth. The city of Regina in Saskatchewan, Canada has officially broken ground on the construction of an indoor aquatics facility (IAF) that features, among other amenities, a deep geothermal heating system. The plan is to drill to a depth of 2000 meters, where thermal waters at 60 C are expected. When completed, the IAD will feature two Olympic-sized pools, a wave pool, waterslides, dry lang training spaces, outdoor play areas, and community areas. The project is expected to be completed in 2029. The total budget for the project is $313.6 million, $28.5 million of which will go towards the geothermal heating facility. _“The system is modelled to sustain itself with unlimited hot water for at least 70 years,”_ said Erik Nickel, Chief Operating Officer of [PTRC Sustainable Energy](https://ptrc.ca/). _“It builds on Saskatchewan’s oil and gas drilling expertise, now applied in an urban atmosphere.”_ Realizing the project has taken more than a decade, with the initial feasibility study completed back in 2010. Advocates for the project persevered through the years, arguing that the facility will allow the city to host national swimming events and will provide a site for children to practice aquatic sports. Geothermal development for direct use applications has been gaining growing attention in Saskatchewan. In 2022, the University of Regena in Estevan undertook [a study to evaluate the viability of integrating geothermal energy](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/research-work-for-geothermal-greenhouses-to-be-done-in-estevan-canada/) into a greenhouse complex. Before that, Moose Jaw committed to a study to evaluate geothermal as an energy source [for a planned agri-food industrial park](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/community-in-saskatchewan-canada-exploring-geothermal-for-agri-food-industrial-park/). Of course, Saskatchewan is also the site of the planned [30-MW geothermal power project](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/deep-provides-detailed-update-on-geothermal-project-in-saskatchewan-canada/) of [DEEP Earth Energy Production Corp.](https://deepcorp.ca/about/) (DEEP).",

Designated as a reinjection well, the well has three times more injectivity (~150 cubic meters per hour) than the first well and taps into a resource with temperature of up to 79.4 °C. Together with well GT-1, drilled back in 2019, the doublet provides the basis for the geothermal heating project. Construction of the geothermal heating plant adjacent to the well site is also nearing completion. City authorities are considering alternative uses of geothermal water, such as balneology and recreation in swimming pools. Moreover, Miroslaw Wypiór of utility company PGKiM stated that an application has been submitted the [National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management](https://www.gov.pl/web/nfosigw-en) (NFOSiGW) for the drilling of a third geothermal well.

The [Japan Energy and Metals National Corporation](https://www.jogmec.go.jp/index.html) (JOGMEC) and Indonesian state-owned geothermal developer and operator [PT Geo Dipa Energi](https://www.geodipa.co.id/) (GDE) have signed a collaboration agreement for the field demonstration of a “method for identifying acidic geothermal fluid reservoirs.” The demonstration and evaluation of the method will be done at the Geo Dipa’s [Patuha geothermal field](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/patuha-geothermal-power-plant-indonesia-celebrates-10-years-of-operations/) in West Java, Indonesia. This agreement follows up on a memorandum of understanding signed between the two companies in 2023 to build a collaborative relationship in the field of geothermal resource development in Indonesia. A critical foundation of the collaborative project is a study done by JOGMEC on the development of geological and geochemical survey methods for estimating acid fluid distribution areas in geothermal systems. The technical study (in Japanese) is available [via this link](https://geothermal.jogmec.go.jp/report/jogmec/file/240603.pdf). The study aims to develop a generalized method for accurately identifying areas where acidic geothermal fluids exist, allowing for selectively extracting neutral geothermal fluids. This may contribute to the long-term stable operations of geothermal power plants. Knowledge gained from this study can then be applied to geothermal resource surveys in Japan. The scope of work under the project will include geological and geochemical surveys, laboratory analysis and data analysis of rock and fluid samples, and updates on the method used for acid fluid potential prediction. The work is expected to be completed with the 2025 fiscal year, but an extension of the survey period and future surveys are also anticipated. This will be the first project led by JOGMEC under the “Overseas Geothermal Resource Survey” program, where JOGMEC conducts resource surveys and exploration in overseas countries with geologic environments similar to those in Japan. This program started in 2021. It is also part of the Japan-led Asia Zero Emissions Community (AZEC) initiative and the Asia Energy Transition Initiative (AETI). In February 2025, the Government of Japan published the Seventh Strategic Energy Plan which sets a target of 40-50% renewable energy in the power generation mix. A target of 1-2% for geothermal energy was set under this strategy, which is a significant increase from its current 0.3% contribution. The installed capacity for geothermal power generation in Japan[ remains just over 600 MWe](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/thinkgeoenergys-top-10-geothermal-countries-2024-power/) as of the end of 2024.",

During an interview with the Bloomberg Adria television channel, Ivana Meašic, the Director of Enna Geo, discussed the challenges that the company is dealing with in developing and investing on geothermal projects in Croatia. Meašic also provided a few updates on the status of their geothermal projects in Zagocha and Babina Greda. Enna Geo, a subsidiary of the [Energia Naturalis](https://www.enna.hr/en) (ENNA Group), is currently working on the 20-MW Zagocha Geothermal Power Plant, located in Cadavica near Slatina. [Drilling had started in the site in late 2024](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/drilling-starts-for-slatina-2-geothermal-project-in-croatia/). As Measic recounted, the company has already secured an energy permit and connection contract for the project, but is still awaiting the tender for the award of the market premium. The Croatian Energy Market Operator (Hrvatski operator tržišta energije d.o.o. / HROTE) is in charge of conducting tenders for renewable energy in Croatia. Measic stated that they have been waiting for a year and a half for announcement of the premium tender for geothermal quotas. _“I have already seen the fourth minister, each of them supported geothermal, but if we want to have a geothermal power plant connected to the system, HROTE must urgently announce a tender for the geothermal quota,”_ said Meašic. _“We are about to obtain a building permit, but we are stuck because we cannot start developing the project and ordering equipment because we are waiting for this state that swears by the development of geothermal energy, but in this specific case nothing is being done,”_ said Meašic about the same topic, during the event “Energy from the Deep 2025” organized by Energetika Marketing. Aside from the project in Zagocha, Enna Geo is also expecting to start the drilling of an exploratory well at the Babina Greda geothermal prospect by August 2025. The company had [acquired the exploration rights to the Babina Greda 2 site](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/enna-geo-acquires-babina-greda-geothermal-2-project-in-croatia/) in 2024, supplementing [the Babina Greda 1 license](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-player-takes-over-babina-greda-geothermal-project-croatia/) that the company has held since 2022.

    "content": "Research being done on two geothermal boreholes in the Schlattingen region of Thurgau, Switzerland has provided crucial insight on the geothermal resource. A geothermal research project in the Canton of Thurgau in Switzerland has been running for two years, and has provided some important information on the subsurface and the characteristics of the geothermal resource. Findings from the research will be crucial in helping identify other suitable locations for geothermal use, particularly in the area around Schlattingen. An important element in this geothermal research project is the existence of two deep boreholes that are currently providing heat to greenhouses in Schlattingen. [Since 2022](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/swiss-greenhouse-farmer-receives-long-term-concession-for-geothermal-project/), Grob Gemüse AG has been using these two geothermal boreholes. Water from these boreholes has a surface temperature of 64 °C, which then provides heating to greenhouses. The system helps save around half a million liters of heating oil per year. Moreover, the boreholes are drilled into the Muschelkalk at 1200 meters depth, a water-bearing clay and limestone formation that hosts the geothermal resource in the area. This provides an opportunity to gain insight on the resource. Therefore, the Canton of Thurgau submitted a research project to the [Swiss Federal Office of Energy](https://www.bfe.admin.ch/bfe/en/home.html) (SFOE) in 2022. _“The goal is to understand how this geothermal reservoir works and thus increase the chances of success for the future use of geothermal energy,”_ emphasized Philippe Müller, Head of the Energy Research and Cleantech Section at the SFOE. The SFOE and the Canton of Thurgau are sharing the costs. Grob Gemüse AG, for its part, is making the boreholes available for scientific purposes. The research work, led by the [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/index_eng.html), began in early 2023 with the collection of water samples. Comprehensive analyses show that the water from the two boreholes has different origins. Borehole 1 was drilled vertically, while borehole 2 was deviated, so that the catchments are located approximately one kilometer apart. The water from the vertical borehole comes from precipitation that fell during the last Ice Age in the Wutach Valley region of the southern Black Forest. This is where the water-bearing carbonate layer, located in Schlattingen at a depth of approximately 1,200 meters, rises to the surface. The precipitation was able to seep in at this point. Interestingly, a significant proportion of the water from the deviated borehole 2 comes from the crystalline basement, i.e. from rock layers that are even deeper. Dr. Christoph Wanner, scientific director of the project from the University of Bern, explained that this can be proven beyond doubt by, among other things, increased concentrations of helium and lithium. The chemical composition of the water from borehole 2 is similar to the thermal water in Schinznach, Baden, or Riehen. Because it originates from deeper layers, one would expect a higher temperature. However, the difference to the water temperature from borehole 1 is very slight. This suggests that the water must have cooled on its way to the extraction point. This means that the site of water ascent from the crystalline basement is far from the water intake of borehole 2, or the water is rising only slowly. Such water ascents from the basement occur along fault zones, i.e., in cracks and crevices. One such fault zone, the “Randen Fault,” is located near the boreholes. There, the rock layers have been shifted or displaced due to forces in the Earth’s interior. The closer a borehole is to fault-related water ascent zones, the higher the water temperature should be. _“Fault zones are therefore of particular interest for this type of geothermal energy use, so-called hydrothermal geothermal energy,”_ explained Dr. Christoph Wanner. The findings from the research project to date are being incorporated into two models. The first model simulates groundwater flows in the immediate vicinity of the two boreholes. The second model also considers fracture networks near fault zones to better understand the rise of groundwater from the crystalline basement. The models provide a clearer picture of the water-bearing rock layers for the area around Schlattingen, but are also valuable for the canton of Thurgau. The research project will be completed in autumn 2025. The new insights into the subsurface will facilitate decisions to identify other suitable locations for the use of geothermal energy, thus increasing the chances of success for future geothermal projects in the canton.",

    "content": "India’s new geothermal policy aims to test viability with pilots in Uttarakhand and Arunachal, drawing interest from Icelandic and Norwegian firms. India has released a new National Policy on Geothermal Energy aimed at testing the commercial viability of this renewable resource, with pilot projects expected in Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh, and the Gulf of Cambay. According to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), international companies from Iceland and Norway have already expressed interest and carried out early studies in potential sites. The Geological Survey of India has identified 381 hot springs nationwide, with surface temperatures ranging from 35°C to 89°C. Additional information can be found in this article of [Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/opinion/editorial/digging-deep-india-s-geothermal-policy-should-be-pursued-with-care-125092301406_1.html). **Potential and policy goals** India is estimated to hold 10.6 GW of geothermal potential, much of it in the Himalayan Geothermal Province, Gujarat’s Cambay Basin, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that India’s market could grow to 4.2 GW by 2035 and nearly 100 GW by 2045. The policy introduces financial support for research and pilot projects, including possible viability gap funding, and coordination across ministries and state governments. Repurposing abandoned oil and gas wells is also being considered as a pathway to accelerate development. **Global context** Globally, geothermal capacity remains under 17 GW, with the US, Indonesia, and the Philippines leading. Iceland and Norway have pioneered technologies that India hopes to adapt in its pilot efforts. “Geothermal can help provide electricity and heating in hard-to-reach areas such as Ladakh and the Andaman Islands, where energy costs are very high,” MNRE Secretary Santosh Kumar Sarangi said. **Early projects** So far, five projects have been sanctioned under MNRE, including one with IIT Madras and Vedanta to retrofit oil wells in Rajasthan. The new policy is expected to expand the pipeline and attract more international cooperation. For further coverage on India, see our [overview](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/?s=India).",

    "content": "Exploration of the Top 5 geothermal prospect sites in Taiwan have yielded promising results, with new exploration methods and technologies playing a key role. The Geological Survey and Mining Management Center (GSMC) under the [Ministry of Economic Affairs](https://www.moea.gov.tw/) of Taiwan has reported progress on the exploration of the top five high-potential areas for geothermal resources in the country. Multiple exploration technologies were deployed mostly to overcome Taiwan’s geological challenges and ensure high-quality data. Following this, the GSMC will be expanding the exploration campaign to 15 other promising sites. According to early studies, the top five areas account for about 80% of the total geothermal potential of Taiwan. These areas are as follows: * Datun Mountain, Taipei * Lanyang River, Yilan * Ruisui, Hualien * Hongye-Wulu, Taitung * Zhiben-Jinlun The MOEA had recently prioritized development of the Lanyang River geothermal area, citing its advantages both in terms of the quality of resources and the ease of accessibility and connectivity. The GSMC has provided some details on the initial results of the geothermal exploration campaign. A 245 °C resource has been detected at the igneous-sedimentary boundary in the Macao area of the Datun Mountain. A 175 °C upwelling channel has been found in the Ruisui area. Temperatures of 150 °C have been measured at the Haiduan and Yanping areas in Taitung. The results of the surveys will be made public on the Geothermal Exploration Information Platform, upholding the value of transparency and helping to spread awareness and support for geothermal. The Government of Taiwan has expressed strong support for geothermal development. For instance, the Executive Yuan Councilor Chen Jinde recently visited the drilling site of the CPC Corporationa’s [Yuanshan No. 1 deep geothermal well](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/drilling-starts-on-4-km-geothermal-well-in-yuanshan-yilan-county-taiwan/) in Yilan County, as well as[ Taipower’s Yilan Renze geothermal power plant](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/taipower-inaugurates-renze-geothermal-power-plant-in-yilan-county-taiwan/). The mountainous terrain of Taiwan pose significant challenges to geothermal exploration. For this reason, the GSMC has expanded their exploration methods from traditional ground-based techniques to airborne gravity and magnetic surveys. Recently, the Center[ introduced Canada’s MobileMT airborne magnetotelluric technology for the first time](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/taiwan-to-deploy-airborne-mt-technology-for-geothermal-exploration-in-yilan-county/), conducting surveys in the middle and upper reaches of the Lanyang River. This technology effectively analyzes the distribution and pathways of heat sources within one kilometer underground. The Center is also collaborating with industry, academia, and research to gradually delineate deep heat reservoir structures through geological surveys, physical exploration, and structural analysis. This “three-dimensional exploration” strategy, combining air and land exploration, improves exploration accuracy and lays the foundation for further geothermal assessment in Taiwan.",

Following the report of a[ new production well drilled at the Lighting Dock geothermal field](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/zanskar-reports-exceptional-results-of-new-geothermal-well-at-lightning-dock-nm/) in New Mexico, [Zanskar Geothermal & Minerals, Inc.](https://www.zanskar.com/) (Zanskar) has now announced they are now powering the entire 15-MW power plant with just the single production well. This is a laudable milestone for the company, as it comes less than a year after [their acquisition of the geothermal power facility](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/zanskar-acquires-lightning-dock-geothermal-power-plant-new-mexico/). Zanskar further provides details on their achievements in drilling the new production well, thereby validating the thesis that there are still conventional geothermal resources that are untapped and being overlooked. These included faster drilling using PDC bits, precision steering and oversized intermediate casing to allow the installation of a large-capacity line-shaft pump, deviated drilling, and stochastic resource modeling to plan for a wider range of possible reservoir conditions. The new production well drilled a target depth of ~8000 feet (~2438 m) using PDC drill bits, resulting in 130% faster drilling compared to average drilling time without PDC bits at the Lightning Dock geothermal field. The vertical section was drilled over the first 1800 feet (548 meters), ensuring that there was very little deviation from the vertical to ensure that a line-shaft pump can be installed and operated with minimal issues. The team was successful in doing so, recording a maximum of around 1 degree of deviation over the the whole vertical section. Drilling was then deviated over the course of 5000 feet (1524 m) to hit the reservoir target which was ~2000 feet (~609 m) away. This allowed the team to keep the wellhead close to the plant while still reaching the high-potential target zones, thus minimizing surface infrastructure. Lastly, the team installed a 14-inch line-shaft pump, the largest geothermal line-shaft pump on the market. The decision came about due to a measured productivity index of ~50 gallons per minute per psi (~45.7 L/s/bar) on the production well. Assuming a brine outlet temperature of 50 C, this makes the new production well the more productive than any geothermal well in Nevada, and the most productive pumped geothermal well in the USA.",

    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "25 Aug 2025",
    "content": "The current pricing mechanism for geothermal power plants in Türkiye needs to be improved to draw more investment, according to JED Chairman Ali Kindap. Domestic and foreign investors are ready to enter the Turkish geothermal sector, but the current pricing mechanism does not encourage an investment environment. This is according to a statement by Ali Kindap, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the [Geothermal Energy Association](https://www.jeotermalenerjidernegi.org.tr/) (JED) of Türkiye, who also appealed for a base price of at least 8 cents per kWh for geothermal power plant that fall outside the scope of the 10-year Renewable Energy Resources Support Mechanism (YEKDEM). Türkiye has been a very strong contributor to geothermal power development in the last decade or so, increasing its installed capacity by more than a hundredfold between 2010 and 2020. By the end of 2024, the country holds a steady position in the top 10 countries for geothermal power with an installed capacity of 1734 MWe. Despite the success of Türkiye and its position of importance in the global geothermal sector, geothermal power plants that have completed the 10-year YEKDEM period are “condemned to float alone in the ocean.” Once they are excluded from the incentive system, these power plants only sell their electricity for a gross price of 6.5 to 7 cents per kWh, essentially continuing production at a loss. _“As a sector, we recommend setting a floor price, not a ceiling, for geothermal power plants that continue to operate as base-load despite being excluded from the YEKDEM system, and setting this limit at no less than 8 cents. This way, investors can conduct cost accounting and generate resources for renewal and capacity-maximizing investments after exiting the incentive system. Given today’s suppressed prices and rising input costs far above official inflation, generating resources for these investments appears impossible,”_ said Kindap. Kindap noted that the disrupted pricing mechanism negatively impacts new investment decisions, noting that geothermal energy investors are undertaking much higher investment costs for resource exploration, discovery, extraction, and processing compared to other renewable energy sources, and that all of these costs are borne by the investor due to the exchange rate. JED Chairman Ali K?ndap also said that a 12.5 cent purchase guarantee is given for 15 years for the energy produced from nuclear power plants, which will become operational in the coming years and whose installed capacity is expected to reach 20,000 MW, due to their base load function. Ali Kindap added that ten years is a very short time in the life cycle of a geothermal power plant, and that there are power plants in the world that have been operating for more than a century. He emphasized that the closure of geothermal power plants, which have zero import dependency, will support the use of energy resources imported with foreign currency. Kindap, who explained that the most vital element for a geothermal investor is the “protection of the geothermal resource,” pointed out that the implementation of a floor price will pave the way for allocating more resources to investments that will sustainably protect geothermal resources The Chairman further stated that 163 MW of geothermal power plants, corresponding to 11 percent of the installed capacity, were removed from YEKDEM in 2024. Another 115 MW of installed capacity will go outside the scope of YEKDEM this year. Between 2016 to 2025, a total of 620 MW of installed capacity of 36% of the total installed capacity will be outside of the coverage of YEKDEM. _“We see that our power plants, which have been excluded from the YEKDEM program, are causing significant losses for investing companies. Domestic and foreign investors are ready to enter the sector. However, the current pricing mechanism does not encourage an investment climate,”_ said Kindap.",

    "content": "A joint research of German institutions is studying changes in rock properties in deep geothermal reservoirs from contact between hot rock and cold water. A new joint research project by institutes in Germany is investigating the impact of changes in deep geothermal reservoirs caused by contact between cold water and hot rock. Thermally induced changes in rock properties such as strength and permeability can have important implications on geothermal utilization, or even socially sensitive issues such as induced seismicity. The “Formation of fractures and changes in permeability in geothermal reservoirs caused by thermally induced stress changes” (TRIGGER) project was officially kicked off at the [Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz](https://www.uni-mainz.de/) (JGU), which is the institution leading the project. The Volcanic Seismology group of the JGU, as well as the Tectonics and Structural Geology, Geodynamics, and Metamorphic Processes groups are involved in the project. Other partners in the project include the Institute for Geothermal Resource Management at the Institute for Innovation, Transfer and Consulting gGmbH in Bingen, Ruhr University Bochum, and Microstructure and Pores GmbH in Aachen. The TRIGGER project is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWK). Of the approximately EUR 2 million in federal funding, about half will go to the JGU groups. They will contribute in particular to researching the microstructural and microchemical composition of the samples and analyzing their deformation, as well as numerically modeling fluid flow and fracture processes. _“We want to understand the influence of thermally induced cracking on rock properties such as permeability and strength, which in turn could influence the amount of extractable thermal water or seismicity – even though we usually don’t even notice these small earthquakes,”_ explains Prof. Dr. Miriam Christina Reiss of JGU, who is the joint coordinator of the TRIGGER project. Contact between cold water and significantly warmer rock can cause cracks to form and changes in the porosity or permeability of the rock, which can have implications for expected seismicity. These small-scale processes cause local changes in rock properties, which in turn affect large-scale reservoir behavior. The TRIGGER joint project aims to investigate exactly how these small-scale processes behave underground. _“We will examine samples from drill cores taken up to three kilometers deep in the laboratory. We will analyze the thermal, mechanical, structural, and chemical properties,”_ explains Reiss. To recreate and better understand the processes involved, the rock will be deformed, cold water will be introduced into heated rock samples, and sensors will be used to determine whether and how the material fractures. In addition, the laboratory experiments are simulated in computer models to gain a deeper understanding of the processes taking place across a wide range of rock properties and temperatures. _“In the laboratory, we can conduct investigations that aren’t possible in the field,” explains the geophysicist. “With this research, we want to better understand the processes on the one hand, but also explore possibilities for more efficient use on the other.”_ One goal of the joint project is therefore to determine the long-term effects of temperature changes of at least 100 degrees on fracture formation and the interactions between the injected fluid and the rock. The research is also intended to contribute to a more detailed analysis of the risk of induced seismicity – that is, human-caused earthquake activity. _“People are much more open to geothermal energy today than they used to be. We want to contribute to a better understanding of the processes and reduce the risks associated with using geothermal energy,”_ says Reiss. The geothermal power plant near [Insheim](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/german-webinar-gives-insight-into-the-operation-of-the-insheim-geothermal-power-plant-germany/) in the Vorderpfalz region has been in operation for over ten years and generates green electricity. Further geothermal projects for heat supply are being planned in Rhineland-Palatinate, for example in [Speyer](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-district-heating-explored-by-speyer-germany/) and [Wörth am Rhein](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/seismic-surveys-to-commence-for-geothermal-exploration-in-worth-germany/).",

    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "31 Jul 2025",
    "content": "The Czech Republic has published an action plan for the development of geothermal energy, specifically low-temperature geothermal for networked heating. The Government of the Czech Republic, through the Ministry of Energy, has published an action plan for the development of geothermal energy for heating applications, alongside other strategies for strengthening the country’s energy security and reducing dependence on fossil fuel imports. The Action Plan ([accessible via this link](https://mzp.gov.cz/system/files/2025-07/Akcni_plan_rozvoje_vyuziti_nizkopotencialniho_obnovitelneho_a_odpadniho_tepla.pdf)) focuses specifically on the development of low-potential renewable heat and waste heat. This covers geothermal heat, ambient heat (air and water), and low-temperature waste heat, with heat pumps as an essential complementary technology. To search for promising areas for the use of geothermal energy, the Czech Geological Survey, a state subsidized organization of the Ministry of the Environment, has maps of subsurface temperatures. Based on the current version of the document, “Development of the use of geothermal energy in the Czech Republic,” the potential of geothermal energy in the Czech Republic is sufficient for the gradual replacement of a significant part of primarily small and medium-sized sources (0.1-20 MW) in thermal energy supply systems. Also of interest to the Czech Geothermal Energy Commission is the use of water from flooded mine shafts to harness geothermal energy, as well as the storage of excess heat using borehole thermal energy storage (BTES). Currently, there are only four deep wells used for geothermal heat supply in the Czech Republic – in Decín, Ústí nad Labem, Mušov, and Pasohlávky. The Decín well supplies about 35% of the heat supply in the network to which it is connected, and is the only major operating source of geothermal energy for thermal supply networks in the country. The Mušovv and Pasohlávky wells suppy to nearby aquaparks and are not connected to any thermal energy network. In contrast, there are already around 30,000 small ground water heat pumps installed in the country, connected either to surface collectors or shallow well systems. Thus, the country has substantial expertise in this technology and public awareness of it is already at a high level. The Czech Geotechnical Society has estimated the technical potential of shallow geothermal energy in Czech Republic to be about 300 GWt, while deep geothermal energy is at the higher hundreds of MWt. However, the 350 usable boreholes for temperature measurement is considered insufficient for a more accurate estimation of geothermal potential. **Recommendations for future development** In general, comprehensive support for the development of low-potential renewable heat and waste heat is highly recommended, as high-potential heat (from biomass, biogas, etc.) currently predominates among renewable energy sources. The development of low-potential heat thus represents a largely untapped opportunity. Geothermal energy is considered as an option to transition thermal energy networks from current fossil fuel sources. This is more viable in smaller networks, considering the limitations of low-temperature geothermal resources. Many conflicts are being anticipated in the further growth of geothermal, particularly relating to topics of public interest (protection of water sources and medicinal resources, protection of karst areas, mining works or landslide risks, etc) and possible distrust of residents. These conflicts will need to be resolved through a transparent and evidence-based approach, similar to current efforts of the Ministry of the Environment for wind and photovoltaic projects. Reducing the risk of drilling appears is essential for the development of deep geothermal energy, for which practices abroad (e.g. France) and the use of a certain type of revolving funds or insurance to cover the risk of failure of the first well need to be explored. Furthermore, it is necessary to significantly increase the level of current knowledge of geothermal energy within the Czech Republic, including by increasing the network of exploratory wells.",

    "content": "China has announced the country's first big data and visualization platform that consolidates data on the country's geothermal springs and wells. The [China Coal Hydrology Bureau](https://eng.yidaiyilu.gov.cn/p/2071.html) and [Fuzhou University](https://en.fzu.edu.cn/) recently held a press conference in Ningde City, Fujian Province to announce the launch of a big data application platform that consolidates and provides visualization of the country’s geothermal resources data. The “One Map of China’s Geothermal Resources” is a first-of-its-kind project for China and provides a useful tool for geothermal development and utilization. The map has currently catalogues 2407 hot springs and 2057 geothermal wells across China. It also has information on 4252 large and medium-sized faults across the country, which can be targets for geothermal drilling. Clicking on each hot spring or well will display parameters such was water temperature and flowrate. The map divides geothermal resources in China into two types – tectonic geothermal belts and large geothermal basins. It also presents a pioneering grading standard for geothermal sites. Through big data algorithms, the platform can be used to predict geothermal resource reserves and well parameters. This scientific and systematic classification provides important technical guidance for the development of geothermal resources in China. To apply learnings from the China Geothermal Map, the China Coal Hydrology Bureau located and drilled a high-temperature geothermal well at a depth of 1740 meters in Tanyang Village in January 2025. The temperature at the bottom of the well was measured at 82°C and the surface water temperature was 52°C. Hot water from the well was supplied to the village’s capsule homestay facility. The agency has also built a geothermal heat demonstration project in the high-altitude area of Baoshan Village in Gansu Province. In the future, the China Coal Hydrology Bureau aims to continue promoting the integration of geothermal projects with initiatives on rural revitalizatoin and ecological protection. **[RELATED: Sinopec touts geothermal achievements in China at stakeholder event](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/sinopec-touts-geothermal-achievements-in-china-at-stakeholder-event/)**",

    "content": "Mining and geothermal energy share a mutually beneficial and historical relationship, and capitalizing on this convergence can help boost both industries. A recently published article written by Marit Brommer and Helen Robinson of the [International Geothermal Association](https://worldgeothermal.org/) (IGA) highlights the huge opportunity of the mining and geothermal energy industries to empower each other, both in terms of exploiting economic opportunities and developing complementary skills. **Click here to read the full article,[“Striking heat and metal: why mining and geothermal should forge a new alliance.”](https://www.seequent.com/striking-heat-and-metal-why-mining-and-geothermal-should-forge-a-new-alliance/)** The mining and geothermal energy industries have already had history of working together. The first geothermal power plant in Africa was built in the Katanga Province of the Democratic Republic Congo. Although modest in size at only 250 kW capacity, the binary plant provided power to the local tin mining operations using water from a nearby 91 °C hot spring. A more recent example is [the Lihir geothermal power plant in Papua New Guinea](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/gold-mining-in-png-when-geothermal-heat-is-a-challenge/), which has been supplying power to gold mining operations since 2003. Today, this project is considered a model in the use of geothermal energy for more sustainable mining activities. Another form of synergy between mining and geothermal can be found in the UK and the Netherlands, where water from flooded mine galleries are used to provide low-carbon heating to houses, schools, and businesses. A mine water heating scheme [has been operational in Gateshead since 2023](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/gateshead-uk-mine-water-geothermal-heating-scheme-hailed-a-success/), and [another in Wales](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/mine-water-heat-scheme-in-wales-uk-starts-operations/) just started operating a few months ago. Mining and geothermal share many core exploration methods such as geophysical data acquisition, surface mapping, geochemical sampling and 3D modeling. One such example is the geological modeling software developed by [Seequent](https://www.seequent.com/), which was initially created for mining. However, the subsurface modeling portfolio of Seequent has [played a critical role in shaping the geothermal industry globally](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/interview-how-seequent-remains-relevant-amidst-an-evolving-geothermal-industry/) for more than a decade now. The circularity of this relationship is immediately apparent in the high demand of the geothermal industry for specialty metals, whether in drilling, well construction, or surface infrastructure. Thus, there are several avenues in which the convergence of these two industries can be capitalized on. The article calls for the following concrete measures: * Integrated licensing for overlapping geothermal and mining tenures * Open data platforms for subsurface exploration and resource characterization * Co-investment strategies for joint geothermal-mining projects * Incentives for mine water geothermal planning in closure and reclamation stages",

    "content": "RENAG 2025 brought together stakeholders to promote geothermal in Colombia, highlighting technical advances, strategic opportunities, and pending regulations. For five days, from May 5 to 9, the headquarters of the **Colombian Geological Service (SGC)** hosted more than 130 national and international experts to celebrate the **VII National Geothermal Meeting (RENAG 2025)** , a key event in the technical, regulatory and strategic drive for geothermal development in Colombia. Organized by the [**Colombian Geothermal Association (AGEOCOL)**](https://www.ageocol.org/) since 2016, this event has established itself as the main meeting point for researchers, regulators, companies, and cooperation agencies, with the goal of strengthening alliances, exchanging knowledge, and advancing the sustainable use of this clean, constant, and local energy source. The 2025 edition of the event, held from **May 7 to 9** , focused on **technical advances, regulatory challenges, and strategic opportunities** to position geothermal energy as a pillar of the country’s energy transition. **Five key technical axes** were highlighted during the meeting : 1. **Geophysical and Geological Exploration** : Advances in techniques such as gravimetry, magnetometry, seismic tomography, and secondary data modeling were presented to map areas of geothermal potential in Colombia. 2. **Geochemical Analysis and Lithium Enrichment** : The chemical behavior of geothermal fluids and their potential use in obtaining byproducts such as lithium were discussed, integrating economic feasibility studies. 3. **Geothermal Well and System Optimization** : Innovations in drilling, cementing, and hot dry rock (EGS) systems technologies were addressed, focused on increasing the efficiency of geothermal developments. 4. **Co-production with Hydrocarbon Resources** : The use of abandoned oil and gas wells to generate geothermal energy was explored, including the incorporation of nanofluids and other hybrid solutions. 5. **Environmental and Socioeconomic Sustainability** : Emphasis was placed on the design of regulatory frameworks, social acceptance, and direct uses of geothermal energy such as food dehydration, aligned with a comprehensive vision of sustainability. The event was attended by experts from **the United States, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Ukraine, Israel, India, Brazil and Canada** , as well as representatives from universities (such as the University of Quebec, the National University of Colombia and the Industrial University of Santander), and companies and entities such as **Ecopetrol, ANH, Halliburton, Ormat, Baker Hughes, GaiaEnergy, Petroseismic, Seequent, among others** . During the opening, **Julio Fierro Morales** , general director of the SGC, stressed: > _“Colombia has 25 active volcanic hotspots, and we haven’t generated a single kilowatt from high-enthalpy geothermal energy. It’s time to change that. This energy is beneath our feet, ready to be harnessed.”_ For his part, **Jesús Bernardo Rueda Gutiérrez** , president of AGEOCOL, highlighted that the SGC continues to lead research in areas such as **Cerro Bravo, Cerro Machín, Paipa, Paramillo de Santa Rosa and Azufral** , and reiterated the importance of RENAG as a scientific breeding ground and a space for coordination between the State, academia and the productive sector. The technical agenda included **48 presentations** , **two strategic panels** , **three academic posters** , **two pre-event workshops** , and a **field trip to the[Paipa geothermal system](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/colombia-aims-for-first-geothermal-auction-of-seven-strategic-areas/)**, organized by the SGC Geothermal Research Group and Seequent. In addition, an **international workshop on geothermal regulation** was held , led by **Marit Brommer** , Executive Director of the **International Geothermal Association (IGA)** , who also extended the official invitation to the [**World Geothermal Congress (WGC) 2026**](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/world-geothermal-congress-2026-extends-abstract-submission-to-31-may-2025/) to be held in Calgary, Canada. One of the most discussed topics was the Ministry of Mines and Energy’s long-awaited regulations on the **allocation of geothermal areas, access permits, and power generation** , which generated great expectations for its impact on the execution of pilot projects in the short term. Key insights from RENAG 2025 include: * **More than 15 years of geothermal knowledge in Colombia** : research by the SGC and universities has characterized the country’s geothermal potential with multidisciplinary tools. * **RENAG as a consolidated space for technical and strategic dialogue** : it was ratified as a platform for multi-sector and intergenerational coordination, with the active participation of young researchers. * **Geoscience as a pillar of the energy transition** : the role of subsurface knowledge in national energy planning was highlighted. * **International and regional perspective** : global participation demonstrated Colombia’s growing recognition on the international geothermal agenda. * **The regulatory challenge as a turning point** : advancing a robust regulatory framework adapted to the Colombian context is key to attracting investment and implementing concrete projects. Finally, according to SGC estimates, **Colombia’s geothermal potential could cover up to 8% of the country’s electricity demand** , a figure that would increase with further studies and pilot projects. > _“We hope to be generating gigawatts from this decarbonized source in less than a decade,” concluded Julio Fierro._",

    "content": "Leveraging AI-backed solutions from oil and gas drilling, NOV helps geothermal operators drill their wells with reduced risk and enhanced efficiency. _Drilling remains one of the primary cost drivers of any geothermal development. This means that it also presents plenty of opportunities for improvement. In this article written by**Gary Hickin** of **[NOV](https://www.nov.com/)** , we take a close look at the successful deployment of the company’s AI-backed[ Drilling Beliefs and Analytics](https://www.nov.com/products/drilling-beliefs-and-analytics) platform for geothermal drilling operations in Europe. The case study examines the use of advanced data processing technologies for real-time feedback and proactive remediation of potential issues._ Geothermal well construction is gaining momentum in more locations, driven by the need for reliable energy sources that address global sustainability and carbon reduction targets. However, tapping into deeper, hotter geothermal energy resources presents several drilling challenges, including wellbore instability, differential sticking, and fluid losses. These challenges are compounded in remote locations where real-time oversight is limited, and traditional monitoring techniques cannot effectively detect risks early. A geothermal operator in Europe approached [NOV](https://www.nov.com/) to develop a proactive monitoring and mitigation solution that would enhance drilling efficiency, safety, and reliability. NOV proposed a solution backed by [artificial intelligence](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-ppas-gain-ground-with-data-center-demand/) (AI), which integrates data analytics and machine learning to continuously analyze high-frequency data, extract patterns, and report actionable insights more quickly and accurately than conventional analysis methods. NOV originally developed its AI-driven drilling solution for oil and gas operations. The solution utilizes real-time drilling data to build a probability index or belief system that assesses the likelihood of situations such as ballooning, pack-off, cuttings buildup, or bit whirl. The drilling team receives alerts to take the appropriate corrective actions that mitigate the issue and allow drilling to continue. Encouraged by the results of the AI system’s predictive capability on its legacy drilling data, the operator agreed to deploy NOV’s AI drilling solution in a two-well geothermal pilot study. Specifically, the solution would focus on detecting abnormal pressure losses that could indicate formation damage, fluid losses, or wellbore instability. NOV followed a structured methodology to adapt the AI solution for the geothermal pilot. The system was connected to existing drilling infrastructure on two geothermal drilling rigs, each equipped with a suite of sensors and electronic drilling recorder (EDR) systems. These systems provided high-resolution, real-time data on parameters including weight on bit, torque, rotary speed, standpipe pressure, and block position. Each rig also included an edge computing device integrated with the rig’s EDR data streams, which acquired and processed the real-time operational and contextual data (including information on the bottomhole assembly, casing, and fluids) that served as inputs for the AI models. The AI system employed a hybrid architecture specifically designed to address geothermal dysfunctions. The architecture included Bayesian networks that encode expert drilling knowledge to facilitate probabilistic reasoning. In addition, decision-tree algorithms draw knowledge from historical geothermal and analogous oil and gas wells to perform pattern recognition. These components enable the AI system to combine learned data behaviors with encoded expert knowledge, accurately predicting drilling conditions and detecting anomalies. The system used the output to create belief scores ranging from 0 to 1, which represent the probability of various dysfunctions. The operator visualizes these scores on custom dashboards and sets alerts that serve as a digital “tap on the shoulder.” The operator receives an earlier warning of a potential problem, allowing them to take the proper corrective actions to avoid non-productive time (NPT) or damage to drilling equipment or the wellbore. During deployment in the two-well pilot, the AI-driven solution collected and processed more than 70,000 real-time data points per hour, per rig. The solution consistently demonstrated its ability to detect and classify early signs of abnormal pressure losses, such as mud loss and differential sticking. The operator observed several additional operational benefits from the AI-driven solution, including: * Reduced alert latency, with the edge computing architecture alerting the operator of pressure abnormalities up to 45 minutes earlier than conventional monitoring systems. * Minimized NPT through earlier and more accurate corrective actions, preventing downhole incidents from escalating and requiring longer and more expensive remediation. * Earlier event prediction, thanks to the AI’s ability to quickly detect trends, identify root causes, and propose the right corrective actions. The successful adaptation of an oil and gas drilling data solution to geothermal drilling showcases AI’s versatility and potential in the energy sector. AI’s ability to learn and adapt to new operational contexts proved effective in monitoring and mitigating drilling challenges in the European geothermal pilot. By detecting abnormal pressure losses and offering actionable insights, the solution enhanced operational efficiency and safety while supporting the operator’s environmental efforts. Ultimately, this pilot program showcased AI’s potential to revolutionize geothermal energy exploration, providing a blueprint for future applications in the sector.

    "content": "A proposed bill in El Salvador seeks to establish a framework for prospecting and exploitation of geothermal sites that allows for private participation. The President of the Republic of El Salvador, through the Ministry of Economy, has promoted a new Geothermal Energy Bill which is now being introduced into the Legislative Assembly. The bill proposes the establishment of a legal framework for the prospecting, exploration, and exploitation of geothermal resources in the country that also allows for participation of private entities. According to the proposal, the [General Directorate of Hydroelectric and Mining Energy](https://www.dgehm.gob.sv/) (DGEHM) will act as the administrative authority responsible for enforcing compliance with the regulations, as well as processing permits, authorizations, and concessions. The agency will also identify areas with geothermal potential and put these out to tender to investors, who will then benefit from tax benefits for the first 10 years, as well as exemption from tariffs, income tax, and other duties. Under the proposal, a project is developed through three stages: * Prospecting – this requires only a permit, which lasts 12 months and can be extended * Exploration – this allows for the technical evaluation of the reservoir and the obligation to reinject geothermal fluids; exploration permits are granted for areas up to 50 square kilometers, and last 36 months which can then be extended once for 24 months * Exploitation – this allows for geothermal resource exploitation through concessions of up to 30 years, subject to approval by the Legislature The proposed regulation also includes provision on environmental and water resource protection, the creation of a Geothermal Registry, the requirement to submit financial and technical reports, and corresponding sanctions and fines for violations. If the law is approved, it will go into power six months after publication in the Official Gazette. El Salvador has played a key role as [the leader of the geothermal energy sector in Central America](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/el-salvador-reaffirms-regional-geothermal-leadership-at-11th-geolac/). The country operates two geothermal plants, both under state-owned LaGeo, with an installed capacity of 204 MWe. Just a few months ago, the Ahuachapan geothermal power station celebrated a major milestone with the[ 50th anniversary of its start of commercial operations](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/lageo-celebrates-50-years-of-ahuachapan-geothermal-power-station-in-el-salvador/).",

    "content": "Exploration studies for a proposed thermal spa using geothermal in Bad Vilbel, Germany will receive funding from the European Regional Development Fund. A project to evaluate geothermal resources for a planned thermal spa and swimming pool project in the town of Bad Vilbel in Hesse, Germany will eb receiving funding of EUR 551,200 from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Hesse’s Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy. Planned exploration activities for the “Bad Vilbel Thermal Spa” project will include the collection of seismic data and possibly exploration drilling. The city and district has commissioned the [Josef Wund Thermal Spa Group](https://www.wund.de/) and the [Therme Group](https://www.thermegroup.com/) for this project. Deep geothermal energy is already being successfully utilized for heat supply and spa operations at two of the Therme Group’s locations, Therme Erding and Therme Bukarest. As Minister of Economic Affairs and Energy Kaweh Mansoori explains, the project will create an attractive leisure facility while also improving the understanding of potential geothermal resources in the Wetterau region. _“If the geothermal data gives the green light, the thermal spa will have a sustainable heat supply – a real benefit for the climate and the region. This shows that the energy transition is not an abstract goal, but is being implemented locally. We are counting on renewable energies such as geothermal energy to make a significantly greater contribution to heat supply by 2030. The state government is supporting such projects because they show how climate protection and quality of life can go hand in hand,”_ the Minister further commented. The necessary subsurface information for geothermal energy in Bad Vilbel is not yet available. Subsurface exploration and the evaluation of the obtained seismic data will allow decisions to be made about further steps for the use of geothermal energy. _“If test drilling appears appropriate, we will examine whether the future Bad Vilbel thermal spa can be supplied with environmentally friendly heat from the subsurface year-round – an important step towards a sustainable, resource-efficient, and regionally anchored energy supply,”_ explained Frank Müller, project manager of THERME Bad Vilbel. _“The thermal spa in Bad Vilbel is one of the largest infrastructure projects in the district and a milestone for thermal spa construction throughout Germany. It will contribute to the long-term strengthening of Wetterau as a business and tourism location, especially in light of its profile as a health region with three spa towns,”_ added Jan Weckler, District Administrator of the Wetterau District. **[RELATED: Germany aims for 100 new geothermal projects by 2030](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/germany-aims-for-100-new-geothermal-projects-by-2030/)**",

    "date": "18 Aug 2025",
    "content": "The regulatory body of Hungary has declared that the thermal waters of Budapest will be under a central management to ensure long-term sustainable utilization. The [Supervisory Authority for Regulated Activities](https://sztfh.hu/) (SZTFH) of Hungary has declared that the entire geothermal thermal spring environment of Budapest will be a closed concession area, citing the resources as particularly sensitive and vulnerable. As a consequence of this, the geothermal exploration rights near Budapest that had previously been granted to [PannErgy](https://pannergy.com/) have been revoked. According to Regulation No. 7/2025 of the SZTFH, the research, extraction, and utilization of thermal water within the specified area will require unified, central management. Unfortunately, the target zone for planned geothermal development by PannErgy based on exploration rights also falls within this restricted area. A statement by PannErgy states that the company is now considering all the legal, professional, and business operations available to help decide on the fate of the potential geothermal project in Budapest. For their part, the SZTFH also sent a position paper to publication [VG](https://www.vg.hu/) explaining how they came to the decision. According to the position paper, the experts under SZTFH have been investigating the risk and opportunities relating to thermal water utilization in Budapest. A series of geophysical, geological, and hydrogeological studies were done to create a model that supports the work of water management authorities. However, the SZTFH emphasizes that the regulation will enter into force on 20 June 2025 but will not affect previously issues exploration permits, particularly those that were acquired before the regulation came into force. Rather, the exploration permit of PannErgy was withdrawn because the company had not carried out the exploration tasks specified in the permit at the time frame specified. The SZTFH goes on to state the agency continues to promote geothermal energy as a safe and sustainable renewable energy. The authority will continue to support the licensing processes, supervise legal operations, and work to ensure that geothermal energy becomes an important part of the energy supply of Hungary.",

[Project InnerSpace](https://www.projectinnerspace.org/), in collaboration with [New Mexico Tech](https://nmt.edu/) and the [New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources](https://nmt.edu/research/organizations/geoinfo.php), has published**“The Future of Geothermal in New Mexico”** report, highlighting the state’s potential to produce up to 163 GW of geothermal power. **[Click here to read the full “The Future of Geothermal in New Mexico” document.](https://projectinnerspace.org/resources/Future-of-Geothermal-in-New-Mexico.pdf)** New Mexico stands out as a state that combines favorable geology for geothermal, oil and gas expertise, and political will. Almost all of the western half of the state has enough subsurface heat potential for power generation. Because of its vast hydrothermal resources, New Mexico is one of just seven states in the United States that has an active geothermal plant—the Lightning Dock plant in Hidalgo County, which was[ recently repowered by Zanskar to full capacity.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/zanskar-repowers-lightning-dock-geothermal-facility-in-new-mexico-to-full-capacity/) As the second largest producer of oil and gas in the nation, New Mexico’s workforce is primed with the technical expertise and transferable skills that could easily be harnessed to build next generation geothermal infrastructure. Adopting a 5 GW goal would create 2,000 construction jobs, 750 indirect jobs, and 125 permanent operations and maintenance jobs. New Mexico has already adopted strong policies to govern its geothermal resources, including passing legislation to increase the money available for the Geothermal Projects Development Fund from $5 million to $15 million, and [authorizing the conversion of oil and gas wells](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/bill-on-repurposing-oil-and-gas-wells-to-geothermal-passed-in-new-mexico-us/) into energy storage or geothermal wells. The report identifies 15 additional policies that, if enacted, would spur the development of more geothermal resources by establishing additional legal and regulatory certainty for the geothermal industry, creating conditions to accelerate geothermal production, expanding incentives, encouraging the development of geothermal heating and cooling, and preparing the workforce for new geothermal jobs. _“New Mexico is already leading the nation in energy innovation, and we’re just getting started,”_ said New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. _“Geothermal is the next frontier, and Project InnerSpace’s report confirms we have the renewable resources and momentum to lead. We’re committed to working with industry, environmental, and tribal partners to bring this technology to scale and deliver long-term energy solutions for our communities.”_ _“New Mexico is on the cusp of a geothermal boom that would deliver economic benefits while ensuring a sufficient, affordable and abundant power supply amid growing demand,”_ added Jamie Beard, Executive Director of Project InnerSpace. _“With continued leadership on a few targeted policies, New Mexico could leverage its massive geothermal resources and lead the nation as a producer of geothermal power and heat.”_ Project InnerSpace had previously published “The Future of Geothermal” reports for two other US states, [Texas](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/collaborative-study-highlights-the-growing-momentum-for-geothermal-energy-in-texas/) and [Pennsylvania](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/project-innerspace-publishes-future-of-geothermal-in-pennsylvania-report/).

    "content": "The first geothermal exploration well in Augustine Island, Alaska is now being planned as part of a potential 200-MWe development by GeoAlaska. GeoAlaska has classified Mt. Augustine as a “blind” geothermal system. This means that it lacks surface manifestations but is structurally comparable to Cerro Pabellón (Chile) and the Kakkonda (Japan) fields. Updated modeling now estimates the site’s capacity at 204 MWe (P50), with a potential range between 167 and 243 MWe. Development costs are projected at approximately $2.5 million per installed MWe. The well is planned as a NE/SW deviated well to intersect both the shallow (200–350°C) and deeper (350–400°C) targets. According to Guy Oliver of Ignis Energy, “ _By targeting both zones in one wellbore, we minimize costs while maximizing information on thermal gradient, fracture presence, and fluid connectivity.”_ Despite the project’s remote location roughly 100 km southwest of Homer, Oliver notes that logistical risks are manageable. _“Augustine Island offers good access via shallow sandy beaches and sheltered landing sites. Once equipment is in place, we can drill year-round,”_ he said. The well site sits below the snow line and is advantageous from a risk potential of storm surge and/or tsunami events. Beyond its technical promise, Mt. Augustine could become a strategic asset for Alaska’s Railbelt grid, which supplies over 75% of the state’s population and currently depends on Cook Inlet natural gas. With supply expected to fall short by 2027, geothermal offers a unique opportunity to provide round-the-clock, carbon-free baseload power. _“Geothermal is the only renewable capable in the Region of delivering 24/7 baseload low carbon power,”_ said Oliver._“A project of this scale would be a key part of Alaska’s future energy mix. The highest and best use of the limited gas supply in the Cook Inlet region is to heat Alaska’s homes and commercial buildings.”_ The project was recently featured in the Talk of Alaska podcast by Alaska Public Media, featuring Gwen Holdmann (ACEP), John Eichelberger (Alaska DNR), and Anthony Pennino (GeoAlaska).

The Philippines’ Department of Energy (DOE) has issued Notices of Award (NOAs) under its third Green Energy Auction (GEA-3), allocating a total of 30.9 MW to geothermal energy projects—far below the anticipated 100 MW target. The awarded capacity comes from three bids, submitted by major developer Energy Development Corporation (EDC) and its subsidiary, Bac-Man Geothermal, Inc (BGI). The projects are expected to be implemented between 2025 and 2027. EDC has secured contracts for the Mindanao 3 binary geothermal power plant and the [Bago binary geothermal power plant](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/exergy-to-supply-5-6mw-binary-geothermal-system-to-edcs-bago-field-philippines/), with a combined capacity of 9.3 MW, and with rates ranging from PhP 5.1092 to 7.6441 (USD 0.091 to 0.14 per kWh). Meanwhile, BGI has been awarded contract for the 21.5-MW Tanawon geothermal power plant at a rate of PhP 7.6441 per kWh. GEA-3 was launched to support the country’s energy transition by securing new capacity from emerging renewable energy sources, including geothermal, hydropower, biomass, and impounded ocean energy. A total of 6,720.2 MW was awarded across all technologies. While the overall renewable procurement was successful, the underwhelming response in the geothermal category signals potential hurdles in project readiness or commercial conditions. The DOE had opened GEA-3 to geothermal projects for the first time, aiming to diversify the country’s renewable energy mix beyond solar and wind. The awarded geothermal projects are expected to contribute to the DOE’s Renewable Energy Roadmap, which seeks to increase the share of renewables to 35% by 2030 and 50% by 2040.",

The Geological Survey of North Rhine-Westphalia (GD NRW) will begin a deep geothermal research drilling project in Cologne-Dellbrück at the end of 2025. The project, part of the NRW Geothermal Master Plan, aims to investigate underground rock formations between 600 and 1,000 meters deep for potential district heating applications. The drilling will take place at the unused Thurner Kamp site, carefully chosen for its favorable geology, existing infrastructure, and minimal impact on surrounding areas. A city council resolution has also designated the site as a compensation area, further supporting its suitability. **Key details of the project:** * The drilling will target “mass limestone” layers known for their karst features, which may allow for water flow and geothermal heat extraction. * Core samples and detailed temperature data will be collected to assess the geothermal potential. * The site will be fully restored to its original condition after the project concludes in mid-2026. Dr. Ulrich Pahlke, Director of GD NRW, emphasized the importance of this exploration, stating, “With the drilling in Dellbrück, we are closing an important gap in geoscientific exploration of the Rhineland.” **Strict safety and environmental standards** All work will adhere to stringent mining, water, and nature conservation regulations. The project will include: * Technical protective measures for groundwater * Erection of 20-meter-high drilling rigs and 10-meter-high noise barriers * A noise traffic light system to ensure compliance with noise limits The measures are designed to avoid any disruption to local residents. **Part of a statewide geothermal push** This borehole is the only one planned for Cologne under the Geothermal Master Plan, which aims to meet up to 20% of NRW’s heat demand with geothermal energy by 2045. In Krefeld, similar drilling has already demonstrated significant potential for hydrothermal heat extraction, a promising sign for Cologne’s geothermal ambitions. The public will be kept informed through on-site information, the project website at [geowaerme.nrw](https://geowaerme.nrw.de/presse/geologischer-dienst-nrw-forschungsbohrung-koeln-20252026) and social media updates via @geowaermenrw. **About hydrothermal geothermal energy** This type of geothermal energy uses hot deep water brought to the surface to transfer heat to district heating networks. Once the heat is exchanged, the cooled water is returned underground, providing a climate-friendly and stable energy source year-round.",

    "content": "A new study presents the opportunities for geothermal heating growth in Beius, Romania, as the city seeks to achieve 100% geothermal heating. A study conducted by Icelandic partners presents the opportunities to expand geothermal heating in the city of Beius in Bihor County, Romania. The geothermal district heating system of Beius currently supplies 70% of its population, but the local governments seeks to expand this to 100% coverage. The project “Technical Development of the District Heating System” in Beius was conducted by the National Energy Authority of Iceland together with UAT Beius, with funding from Innovation Norway from the European Economic Area (EEA) and Norwegian grants. The results of the study was presented recently at meeting attended by the Mayor of Beius, representatives from the [Romanian Geoexchange Society](https://geoexchange.ro/), several geothermal specialists from Bihor County, as well as members of the local authority. Baldur Petursson from the Icelandic Environment and Energy Agency stated that there was potential for further development of geothermal in Beius to benefit from EEA subsidies. Further, Horia Ban of the Romanian Geoexchange Society presented complementary projects on heat recovery from spent geothermal brine, which can still be extracted and upgraded using heat pumps. This can be used for industrial and agricultural applications, such as greenhouses, wood drying, and fish farming. Another important conclusion of the study is that heat losses in the district heating system can be minimized by using specialized material, such as pre-insulated PE-Xa pipes. A geothermal well drilled to a depth of 2600 meters in 1996 tapped a high-flow reservoir with a temperature of 85 °C. This jumpstarted the use of geothermal for heating in Beius, supplying affordable and sustainable heat to apartment blocks, hospitals, nurseries, kindergartens, and other public institutions. A second well was drilled in 2004, and a third in 2010. Today, Beius is the city with the cheapest heating costs in Romania. While Western Romania already has extensive history in geothermal utilization, the capital of Bucharest has also undertaken studies to evaluate the feasibility of geothermal heating. In 2024,[ an agreement was signed between the local utility company ELCEN and the US Department of Energy](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-study-in-bucharest-romania-to-be-supported-by-us-doe/) to jointly study the potential for geothermal heating in Bucharest. Another similar agreement was signed later in 2024 for a similar study with Sage Geosystems, in partnership with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).",

    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "29 Aug 2025",
    "content": "A case study by Enedril showcases the value of both ingenuity and proper tool selection in successful fishing operations in geothermal wells. _When something goes wrong in geothermal operations, the corrective measures must be done in a way that causes no further damage to operational assets. In the case of well interventions, one of the top priorities is ensuring that the integrity of the well is not compromised. This is showcased in this case study by French drilling company**[Enedril](https://www.enedril.com/)** where a downhole pump had to be fished out of a well._ Geothermal energy is emerging as one of the most promising solutions for the energy transition. Yet, harnessing underground heat requires complex infrastructure and delicate maintenance operations. Among these, **fishing** —the retrieval of equipment stuck at the bottom of a well—is one of the most challenging maneuvers. A recent case illustrates the technical hurdles involved, as well as the sometimes unexpected solutions that ensure production continuity. During the retrieval of a submersible pump installed in a geothermal well, almost the entire piece of equipment became stuck at great depth. Initial hypotheses suggested that the pump was either lodged at the junction between the 13-3/8’’ and 9-5/8’’ casings, or blocked inside the 9-5/8’’ casing due to the presence of power and treatment cables. The challenge was twofold: precisely locating the pump and defining a fishing strategy that would not compromise the integrity of the well, which was essential for ongoing exploitation of the resource. Several scenarios were considered: the pump might have fallen to the bottom and come to rest in open hole, become stuck on a casing cut at 254 m, or been jammed by residual cables. These uncertainties made planning complex and required the anticipation of multiple technical strategies. Options ranged from recovering the pump body with a large-diameter overshot, to retrieving the central shaft with smaller tools, or fishing for the cables with a harpoon. As a last resort, milling of the casing or pump was considered—a heavy and risky solution. The first attempts proved unsuccessful. Neither the 8-3/8’’ overshots used externally nor the smaller tools targeting the pump shaft managed to free the equipment. The main difficulty lay in the depth of the intervention—over 2,000 meters—and the limited capacity of the rig, which prevented efficient maneuvering at that depth. Faced with these setbacks, the teams began considering milling, viewed as the last resort. In the end, the solution came from a much simpler approach. By using an overshot of only 3-7/8’’ fitted with a small 1-3/8’’ grapple, operators managed to hook onto the pump’s shaft, held in place by two circlips. Against all odds, the pump was successfully extracted the very next day. Beyond the technical anecdote, this operation highlights[ the strategic importance of maintenance in geothermal energy](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/hd-completes-milestone-turbine-maintenance-work-for-iceland-geothermal-power-plant/). Each successful intervention helps extend the life of installations, secure energy availability, and guarantee project profitability. In a context where renewable heat is expected to play a central role in decarbonization, mastering such operations is crucial. This case study also serves as a reminder that successful fishing relies as much on the ingenuity of the teams as on the tools at their disposal. Geothermal energy, often perceived as a silent and invisible resource, conceals behind each megawatt produced a wealth of specialized expertise. It is precisely this combination of technical robustness and operational pragmatism that makes geothermal energy an energy source for the future. Founded in 2013, Enedril specializes in directional drilling, fishing operations, and well interventions, including Workover and Plug & Abandonment (P&A). The company also designs and manufactures a wide range of downhole tools, offering tailored solutions for geothermal energy, oil and gas, mineral exploration, and underground storage projects. Its track record includes over 57,200 meters drilled, 32 wells completed, and more than 130 Fishing and P&A operations across 342 projects in France and abroad. Backed by ISO 9001 certification, Enedril maintains rigorous quality systems, standardized procedures, and a culture of continuous improvement.",

    "content": "Bill Gates visits Fervo Energy’s Cape Station in Utah, praising its enhanced geothermal technology as a key to clean, reliable energy. Bill Gates recently toured Fervo Energy’s Cape Station in Beaver County, Utah, recognizing it as a significant step forward in geothermal energy, as he pointed out in a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-visit-utah-see-future-geothermal-power-bill-gates-59j5c/?trackingId=dZ%2Bq0Mvx84VLGdc6awsfpw%3D%3D). The project aims to become the world’s largest enhanced geothermal system (EGS) power plant upon its expected commissioning in 2026. Fervo Energy employs horizontal drilling techniques, adapted from the oil and gas industry, to access geothermal heat more efficiently. This approach allows for the utilization of geothermal resources in areas previously considered unsuitable for traditional geothermal methods. “Geothermal power will have a big role to play in our clean energy future,” Gates stated, emphasizing the potential of Fervo’s technology to provide reliable and affordable clean energy. Cape Station is projected to deliver up to 400 MW of power, with initial production of 70 megawatts slated for 2026 and full capacity expected by 2028. The project has secured power purchase agreements to supply electricity to approximately 350,000 homes in Southern California. Fervo Energy’s innovative approach not only advances geothermal technology but also offers employment opportunities for workers transitioning from the oil and gas sector, leveraging their existing skills in a new context. We have reported previously on a [partnership between Fervo Energy and Italian ORC provider Turboden](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/fervo-energy-turboden-to-collaborate-on-cape-station-geothermal-project-utah/) on the supply of power plant technology for the Cape Station project.

    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "16 Sep 2025",
    "content": "After drilling and well testing, the Ahnsbeck project is positioned to be the showcase for deep geothermal in Lower Saxony, Germany. After[ drilling and extensive well testing](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/democell-project-validates-geothermal-potential-in-lower-saxony-germany/), the DemoCELL project in Ahsnbeck is now considered the most advanced and successful deep geothermal project in the State of Lower Saxony in Germany. Geothermal resources with a temperature of 113 °C at a depth of 2500 meters have been verified, and will soon be harnessed for district heating. _“Nowhere in Lower Saxony are we as advanced as we are here,”_ Carsten Mühlenmeier, President of the State Office for Mining, Energy and Geology (LBEG) said during a visit to the drilling rig near Ahnsbeck. The DemoCELL project is a collaboration between the [Georg-August University of Göttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/1.html) and [Baker Hughes](https://www.bakerhughes.com/). The study site is part of a geothermal exploration license area [awarded to Baker Hughes back in 2023](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/baker-hughes-granted-geothermal-exploration-permit-for-ahnsbeck-germany/) by the LBEG. As Dr. Oliver Höhne, project manager at Baker Hughes, explains, only 75 °C is expected at depths of 2500 meters under average conditions. Through the various tests and studies done by the experts at Baker Hughes on the study site, they had already expected that they were standing on a hot spot. Dr. Matthias Franz from the University of Göttingen further explains that the geothermal resources are hosted in a 40-meter-thick layer of the Rhät sandstone. The reservoir formation at this site was of exceptionally high quality, and it was unlikely that such conditions can be found just a few kilometers to the south. The same formation corresponds to that found in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, where the deep geothermal projects in Waren an der Müritz and Neustadt-Glewe have been successfully supplying geothermal energy 1984 and 1994, respectively. Holger Schwenke, Managing Director of [Stromversorgung Osthannover](https://www.svo.de/) Holding GmbH (SVO) assures that households in Celle will be supplied with heat from geothermal in the future. However, the surrounding towns of Ahnsbeck and Lachendorf will have to be connected to the source first. Waste heat from the paper mill can then be used to boost the heat supply to bridge the 12-kilometer distance to Celle. There is substantial heat demand in Celle, particularly in the medieval town center. Schwenke further explained that the company is now just waiting for funding approval from the Federal Ministry of Economics _“We have now issued 42 permits for geothermal exploration, 32 of them in Lower Saxony,”_ explains Mühlenmeier. Aside from Lower Saxony, the agency has also granted seven permits in Schleswig-Holsten, two in Bremen, and one in Hamburg. All these territories are also within the authority of the LBEG. The permits granted by LBEG grants companies the right to search for geothermal resources. However, the discovery risk remains a hurdle at this stage, especially if deep geothermal resources are being targeted. However, this is no longer the case in Ahnsbeck following the drilling and well testing phases. “There’s now almost unlimited energy available here,” explains Mühlenmeier. _“Ahnsbeck can become a showcase project.”_ In addition to its role as a mining authority, the LBEG is also the Lower Saxony Geothermal Service (NGD), which provides technically neutral and economically independent advice on near-surface and deep geothermal energy and creates and maintains geoscientific fundamentals",

    "content": "The city of Orléans, France is no longer pursuing plans for a pilot geothermal heating project over issues relating to land use and unexpectedly higher costs. Plans for a geothermal heating project serving the Nécotin school complex in Orléans, France have officially fallen through as announced by city officials. The project, first announced in March 2024, turned out more expensive than initially expected and ran into land use issues. The initial plan is for a pilot project to utilize geothermal to replace natural gas heating in the Nécotin school complex. The work was supposed to take place during the summer school holidays of 2025, with commissioning to follow by the fall. If the project proved successful, geothermal heating can then be deployed to other public institutions in the city. The reasons for no longer pursuing the project were announced during a city council meeting. Based on the feasibility study, the project was going to cost EUR 2 million. However, after bids had been submitted, it was discovered that the cost would exceed EUR 3 million. Moreover, 25 boreholes had to be drilled over a substantial area, which would introduce issues relating to land use. Sandrine Menivard, Deputy Mayor in charge of rehabilitation work, however explained the the project would have delivered on its CO2 emissions promise. According to the offers, the system would reduce CO2 emissions by up to 90% and deliver energy savings of 75% to 80%. _“We can only regret this rather significant difference between the preliminary study and the actual proposal. I therefore understand the desire not to extend it to other schools, but we could perhaps have pushed the exercise to the end, at least in this school,”_ said councilor Baptiste Chapuis, who had supported the project since its initial announcement.",

A groundbreaking event hosted by [Bedrock Energy](https://bedrockenergy.com/) and the town of Hayden, Colorado provided a rare, up-close look at the drilling technology that will pave the way for Colorado’s first municipal geothermal network. The event, **“Rocky Mountain Resilience: Colorado Geothermal in Action,”** was a milestone in celebrating the potential of geothermal development in Colorado using innovative technologies, thus strengthening the energy infrastructure and supporting rural economic growth. In attendance were U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, utility executives, state energy leaders, and local officials. Colorado Governor Jared Polis also visited the site prior. As part of the event, a live drilling demonstration showcased the active construction of geothermal heat exchangers to a thousand feet below ground, leveraging Bedrock Energy’s AI-driven subsurface modeling and intelligent drilling machinery. These “seeing-while-drilling” technologies “read” the earth inch-by-inch during a subsurface construction process, and the computationally-guided drilling controls achieve faster, deeper, less manually intensive, and more controlled installation of geothermal. In Colorado, Bedrock’s technologies have been reducing the space and time required for geothermal construction by over 50%. _“This project represents more than a new energy system — it’s an investment in Hayden’s future. By building a district-scale geothermal network for our new business park, we’re creating the infrastructure to attract employers, support local jobs, and give our community reliable, cost-effective heating and cooling for decades to come,”_ said Mathew Mendisco, Town Manager of Hayden. _“This drilling showcase gave energy and policy leaders a real, boots-on-the-ground example of geothermal deployment in action, and we demonstrated that advancements in geothermal technologies are ready to serve communities with concrete benefits today,”_ added Joselyn Lai, Co-Founder and CEO of Bedrock Energy. _“By combining AI subsurface technologies and precision drilling, Bedrock is bringing reliable, cost-effective, clean thermal energy to regions that historically have had limited affordable options. We’re grateful to the Town of Hayden, our partners, and the leaders who joined us for showing what’s possible when innovation meets local commitment.”_ “ _Our energy future is happening right now – right here in Hayden. This partnership between the Hayden community and Bedrock Energy is unleashing clean, reliable, and efficient geothermal technology for the community, driving good-paying jobs and lowering energy bills,_ ” further said Senator John Hickenlooper. The project is supported by the Colorado Energy Office’s Geothermal Program, the Colorado Office of Just Transition in the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, and the Colorado Department of Local Affairs.

The study is expected to provide evidence-based recommendations to ensure that any solution adopted is cost-effective, sustainable, and tailored to the unique needs of OECS Member States. A shared drilling rig will theoretically allow the Member States to share the cost of acquiring a rig across multiple projects, making drilling more affordable and improving the economic feasibility of geothermal projects. It will also allow for timelier and coordinated exploration and production drilling campaigns, reducing wait times and enabling projects Key challenges identified may include the logistical complexities of operating heavy equipment across multiple islands. However, mobilisation and demobilisation of rigs from outside the region are among the most expensive components of geothermal drilling in small island states. _“Working with Member States, regional partners, and international financiers, we will use the findings of this study to gain insights so we can advise member states on the feasibility of having a drill rig for use in drilling, expanding and maintaining geothermal energy production in the OECS. The findings will be presented to key stakeholders, especially the Council of Ministers: Energy in the OECS,”_ said Dr Ernie Stapleton, Project Manager at OECS GEOBUILD.

The geothermal lithium projects of [Vulcan Energy Resources](https://v-er.eu/de/) in Germany and [Eramet](https://www.eramet.com/en/) and [Électricité de Strasbourg](https://www.es.fr/) (ÉS) in France have been classified as “strategic projects” by the European Commission under the Critical Raw Materials Act. With this distinction, the two projects can benefit from streamlined and priority processing, thus facilitating administrative procedures and funding applications. The CRMA establishes clear targets for increasing domestic capacities within the strategic raw material supply chain, while improving access to funding, and ensuring adherence to the highest social and environmental standards. “Strategic projects” identified under the CRMA are those that are deemed to have the the potential to help increase European Union (EU) capacity to extract, process and recycle strategic raw materials and diversify EU supplies from third countries. _“Achieving Strategic Project status from the European Commission validates the importance of our integrated lithium and renewable energy project to European industry, and builds momentum for the delivery of Europe’s first fully domestic and sustainable lithium value chain,”_ said Cris Moreno, Managing Director and CEO of Vulcan Energy. _“The CRMA plays a pivotal role in driving change and highlighting the importance of sustainable raw material extraction in Europe. With access to Europe’s largest lithium resource, our Project is strategically positioned to support the CRMA benchmarks and diversify the EU’s lithium supply away from third countries.”_ The Alsace Géothermie Lithium (Ageli) of Eramet and ES aims to harness the geothermal waters of the Rhine Graben in Northern Alsace, France to produce decarbonated energy and the lithium needed for Europe’s future battery industry. To achieve this, Eramet has adapted its patented process for direct extraction of battery-grade lithium, one of the most responsible in the world, which is already operational on the Centenario site in Argentina.[ A pilot project had been inaugurated](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/eramet-and-es-launch-geothermal-lithium-pilot-in-rittershoffen-france/) at the Rittershoffen geothermal heat plant in 2023. _“We are delighted that the European Commission considers Ageli to be a “strategic project” capable of making a lasting contribution to the European Union’s security of supply. We hope that this label will act as a lever for the development of this ambitious project, and that it will result in political and financial support commensurate with the technological, economic and strategic challenges to overcome,”_ said Geoff Streeton, Vice President for Strategy, Innovation and Business Development of Eramet. _“The European Commission’s recognition marks an important step forward for the Ageli project. It encourages us in our ambition to develop, with our partner Eramet, one of the most responsible lithium production projects in the world, with a positive impact on the region. Our teams are committed to providing Alsace with our expertise in the development of high-temperature geothermal projects and our experience in operating two geothermal plants for almost 10 years,”_ added Marc Kugler, CEO of ES Group.

    "content": "Research drilling in Krefeld, Germany has been completed, with tests indicating that the geothermal reservoir is thicker and more productive than expected. The drilling and testing of a geothermal research well in the city of Krefeld in North Rhine-Westphalia Germany have now been almost completed, and early results are promising. The postulated limestone host of the geothermal resource was successfully drilled into, and was found to be much thicker than initially thought. After four weeks of drilling, the Kohlenkalk was reached at a depth of 380 meters. A pleasant surprise came when the well intersected the base of the Kohlenkalk at 944 meters, which is much deeper than the postulated depth of 725 meters. This means that the host rock is thicker than expected, thus also increasing the potential for geothermal utilization at the site. Subsequent hydraulic tests also confirmed that more water can be pumped from the borehole than initially expected. Nearly 667 meters of core samples were collected from the wellbore, and the analysis of these samples is still ongoing. As project leader Ingo Schäfer explains: _“They tell us a lot about the carbon limestone, its reservoir properties, and the geological processes that formed it. The new findings are applicable to the entire region—and this is precisely the information we need to professionally assess the potential for the safe and sustainable use of deep geothermal energy.”_ The drilling is part of the statewide exploration and drilling program “Geowärme – Wir erkunden NRW.” This program is being implemented as part of the [NRW Geothermal Master Plan](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/north-rhine-westphalia-germany-publishes-geothermal-energy-master-plan/), published in 2024 by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Industry, Climate Protection and Energy of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia. The goal of the program is to explore deep-lying heat deposits in North Rhine-Westphalia in order to cover around 20 percent of the heat demand with climate-friendly geothermal energy by 2045. According to the Geological Survey of North Rhine-Westphalia, the next deep research drilling is already planned for early 2026[ in Cologne-Dellbrück.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/cologne-sets-sights-on-deep-geothermal-potential/) Anyone wishing to explore and extract geothermal energy from depths of over 400 meters in Germany requires a corresponding mining permit. Exempt from this are drilling operations carried out as part of the state’s geoscientific survey, such as the one conducted by the GD NRW in Krefeld. The temporary research well does not meet the technical and legal requirements for a permanent production well. Therefore, the borehole will be backfilled according to regulations, and the drilling site will be completely dismantled. The parking lot will then be fully accessible again.",

To explore geothermal potential of this area TLS Geothermics has acquired a new lease in western Saxony for geothermal exploration (OstVogtland Warme project). TLS Geothermics has developed, inside its systemic exploration workflow, a dedicated geophysical process in order to quantify B-CFZ geothermal potential. This workflow is based on the joint inversion of gravity, passive seismic and magnetotelluric data (3 passive methods). Each method provides complementary information on density, resistivity and seismic velocity models in the crust. Combined, these methods can help to quantify pressure, temperature, lithology (mineralogy and porosity) as well as fluid composition, with the ultimate goal of efficiently quantifying the geothermal potential and target the first exploration wells. Agathe Hantraye has an Engineering Degree and a Master’s degree in Geophysics from the School and Observatory of Earth Sciences (EOST) in Strasbourg, France. Following a stint as an intern student in TLS Geothermics, she is now working as a Geophysical Engineer and is responsible for seismic survey design, preparation data acquisition missions, and data analysis. Nicolas Dall’asta has a Master’s Degree n Geology and Earth Dynamic from the University of Strasbourg and a PhD in Earth Science from the University of Pau and Pays de l’Adours. He is currently an Exploration Geologist for TLS Geothermics and is responsible for geothermal projects in Martinique and Germany.

    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "15 Apr 2025",
    "content": "Developing a geothermal power project has been a transformative process for St. Kitts and Nevis, setting it on a path to being a fully sustainable island state. _As part of the buildup to[this year’s Global Sustainable Islands Summit 2025](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-in-focus-at-global-islands-summit-2025-25-30-may-2025-st-kitts-and-nevis/), James Ellsmoor, CEO of Island Innovation, did an interview with Hon. Konris Maynard of the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis. The insights from that conversation have been published below._ The Caribbean twin-island Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis is embarking on an ambitious journey that could transform it into the Western Hemisphere’s first fully sustainable independent nation. During a recent conversation with Hon. Konris Maynard, Minister of Public Infrastructure, Energy, Utilities, and ICT, I gained valuable insights into how this small nation is tackling large energy challenges through innovative approaches to geothermal development. For Small Island Developing States (SIDS), energy isn’t just about keeping the lights on—it’s the foundation upon which all economic development rests. Minister Konris Maynard emphasised how the current high energy costs are significantly impacting the Federation’s economy, with the government currently subsidising residential electricity costs through the Fuel Variation Charge to shield consumers from the full burden of escalating global fuel prices. This subsidy, while necessary in the short term, represents a substantial fiscal challenge apparent across many SIDS that diverts resources from other critical development areas. The economic implications extend beyond household budgets, as high energy costs also deter energy-intensive industries from establishing operations in the Federation, limiting economic diversification and employment opportunities. The government’s push toward renewable energy, particularly geothermal, represents a strategic shift away from this previous model toward one that promises both economic and environmental benefits. Saint Kitts & Nevis possesses distinct advantages for geothermal development that make it particularly promising. As Minister Maynard explained, _“The heat amount is much closer to the surface than in other areas of the world, so you don’t have to drill as deep to get to it.”_ This geological advantage significantly reduces exploration and development costs. The journey toward harnessing this resource has been complex, involving multiple administrations and financial institutions. The current breakthrough came through [a financing structure from the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) called a “contingently recoverable grant facility,”](https://www.caribank.org/sites/default/files/publication-resources/Partnering%20Renewable%20Energy.pdf) providing $17 million USD—$16 million for drilling and $1 million for technical support. The innovative risk-sharing mechanism converts to a concessionary loan if drilling succeeds or a grant if it fails, thereby reducing the financial risk for the Federation. However, this funding alone wasn’t sufficient to attract top-tier drilling companies to the project. Minister Maynard noted that the $16 million would only fund approximately three wells, making it challenging to entice global drilling experts to mobilise for such a limited scope. The solution came through [additional financing of $20 million from the Saudi Fund for Development](https://www.loopnews.com/content/st-kitts-and-nevis-secures-us20m-loan-for-geothermal-development/), bringing the total available funding to $36 million—[enough to drill five wells](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/nevis-geothermal-project-going-into-bidding-process-for-drilling/) (three production wells and two reinjection wells). Perhaps equally important was resolving the long-standing political challenge between the federal government and the Nevis Island Administration (NIA). The current administration took a decisive step by passing a resolution in the National Assembly declaring geothermal resources on Nevis a federal asset that will receive federal support. This political alignment between the two administrations sends a clear signal to international partners about the Federation’s united commitment to the SKNICE – St. Kitts and Nevis Islands Climate Enhancement Project, for the benefit of all citizens of St. Kitts and Nevis. One of the most transformative aspects of the geothermal development plan is the potential to create a unified electrical grid connecting St. Kitts and Nevis. Minister Maynard highlighted how this interconnection would allow industries on either island to benefit from renewable energy resources developed on either island, creating a more resilient and flexible energy ecosystem. _“With geothermal, it justifies interconnecting the two islands. St. Kitts and Nevis then becomes one electrical grid, so any industry developed on St. Kitts or Nevis will be able to share any renewable energy resource on either island,”_ explained Minister Maynard. This approach maximises the utility of renewable resources across the Federation and creates a more attractive environment for industries that require reliable, affordable electricity. The unified grid represents a physical manifestation of the political collaboration now taking place between the federal government and the Nevis Island Administration. Perhaps the most ambitious aspect of St. Kitts and Nevis’ energy vision is the potential to move beyond self-sufficiency to become a net energy exporter to neighboring islands. With initial estimates suggesting the geothermal wells could produce between 5-10 megawatts each—potentially yielding 15-30 megawatts—the Federation could generate more electricity than it currently needs. Minister Maynard envisions two potential avenues for this surplus energy. First, direct electricity export through undersea cables to nearby islands. Having personally visited Mallorca and witnessed its 250km undersea interconnection with Spain, the Minister noted that Antigua is just 60km away and St. Martin approximately 50km—making such connections technically feasible. Second, using surplus energy for what energy experts call “Power-to-X” applications—converting electricity into other valuable products like hydrogen or ammonia. This approach could create new industries and export opportunities beyond simply selling electricity. _“With this vast resource of geothermal, it opens up industries but also justifies interconnecting with other islands,_ ” said Minister Maynard. _“Right here in the Caribbean, we can be a beacon of energy that interconnects with these islands.”_ As St. Kitts and Nevis prepares to host the [**Global Sustainable Islands Summit 2025**](https://islandinnovation.co/events/global-sustainable-islands-summit/) and the [**Geothermal Energy Forum**](https://islandinnovation.co/events/global-sustainable-islands-summit/geothermal-energy-forum/) , Minister Maynard extended an invitation to renewable energy stakeholders worldwide to participate in these events. _“This is an opportunity to be part of history,”_ he emphasised. _“We are on a path to make St. Kitts and Nevis the first fully sustainable island state in the Western hemisphere and perhaps even the world.”_ The Minister’s closing observation captures the essence of what makes this small nation’s approach to energy so compelling: ** **_“St. Kitts and Nevis is small enough to make big changes.”_ The Federation is demonstrating how opposing political parties can align behind a shared vision of sustainability, and how a nation with limited resources can leverage strategic partnerships to undertake transformative energy projects. **For those interested in renewable energy development, particularly in island contexts, the upcoming**[**Global Sustainable Islands Summit in May 2025**](https://islandinnovation.co/events/global-sustainable-islands-summit/)**presents a unique opportunity to witness this ambitious vision taking shape and to explore partnership opportunities in what promises to be a showcase for sustainable island development.** For more insights from the interview with Hon.

The [Coriance Group](https://groupe-coriance.fr/) has now officially inaugurated the second geothermal heating plant the city of Champigny-sur-Marne in the Île-de-France region of France. Although the plant had already started operations in 2024, it has now opened its doors to the public with exhibitions showcasing the plant equipment and how heat is produced from the groundwater. Since 2016, the Coriance Group had been operating the first geothermal plant and heat network in Champigny-sur-Marne. The original heating network served the Mordacs and Bois l’Abbé districts, in the east of the city. Plans for further expansion of the geothermal heating coverage were [first reported in 2018](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-heating-project-at-champigny-france-plans-2nd-well-and-network-extension/), with Coriance being [awarded the project](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/second-geothermal-district-heating-system-to-be-built-in-champigny-sur-marne/) by the Campinois Public Geothermal Establishment (L’Établissement Public Campinois de Géothermie / EPCG) in 2019. The second heating network was designed to give the residents and districts of the city access to geothermal heating. The work to expand the district heating network began in 2022, creating 9.2 kilometers of new network in the city. Drilling of a doublet started in February 2023, targeting the Dogger Formation at 1800 meters depth. This took around four months. Construction of the new heating plant commenced after drilling and lasted for about a year. By September 2024, the second geothermal heating network started supplying the heating needs of 5,000 homes, saving 9500 tonnes of CO2 each year, equivalent to the emissions of 7900 cars. Elsewhere in the Greater Paris region, the Coriance Group has also started drilling work to [expand geothermal heating in the commune of Alfortville](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/drilling-of-new-geothermal-doublet-in-alfortville-france-officially-starts/), as well as for a new geothermal heating facility[ in the town of Garges-lès-Gonesse](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-drilling-starts-in-garges-les-gonesse-france/).",

In this interview, Ajit provides fantastic insights into how the company is enabling the growth of EGS through transformative technologies, drawing from its rich history in both geothermal and oil and gas. Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) seek to overcome the geographical limitations of conventional geothermal systems by engineering reservoirs in hot, impermeable rock, using stimulation techniques to create artificial flow paths. Baker Hughes considers EGS as a huge opportunity to scale geothermal and accelerate its growth, targeting sites that would not have been considered for conventional systems. _“In the U.S., for example, EGS allows us to move beyond traditional hotspots on the West Coast into much broader territories across the western U.S., where there is high heat but no existing reservoirs,”_ Menon noted. _“This opens up significant new ground for geothermal deployment.”_ With the location flexibility of EGS, it becomes an attractive prospect for any industry or use case that needs constant clean energy. This has drawn interest from organization such as the US Department of Defense, as well as data centers. It is also worth considering for islands or remote areas that need to import energy, or have limited land available for solar and wind. An important technical benefit of EGS is its reduced development risk. EGS allows developers to start with a known geological setting and build the reservoir artificially, leveraging temperature gradients and rock type without entirely relying on the existence of complex hydrothermal reservoirs. This makes it a more attractive option for new investors and developers seeking more predictable outcomes. Baker Hughes has taken a technology-agnostic stance on geothermal development, building a broad portfolio that addresses the entire geothermal value chain: from subsurface imaging and drilling technologies to artificial lift and surface power generation equipment. According to Menon, EGS represents a major step change in the geothermal sector’s ability to scale, both geographically and in terms of project size. EGS as a concept has been around for decades. Even in the 1970s, there have been early efforts for research in EGS, then-known as “hot dry rock.” However, the commercial viability of EGS is now being redefined by technologies and methodologies derived from the shale gas revolution. The oil and gas sector’s advancements in high-temperature drilling, horizontal wells, and large-scale stimulation are now being repurposed for geothermal applications. Baker Hughes draws extensively from its experience in unconventional oil and gas, applying learnings to key EGS pilot programs, including the U.S. Department of Energy’s [FORGE project in Utah](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/utah-forge-extended-circulation-test-confirms-egs-connectivity-and-heat-extraction/) and other commercial developments. The company’s contributions have included specialized drill bits and bottom-hole assemblies that broke performance records in hard rock conditions. _“Much of what we’re doing today in EGS builds on what we learned in shale,”_ said Menon _. “FORGE has been critical in validating those approaches for geothermal. We’ve moved from theoretical models to field-proven applications.”_ An important part of Baker Hughes’ EGS approach is the characterization of the subsurface fracture network. Poor understanding of fluid pathways was a key contributor to past EGS projects that did not meet their goals. To address this, the company applies advanced modeling tools to develop heat-flow-enabled reservoir simulations, which integrate both static geological inputs and dynamic stimulation models. These are used to optimize well locations and trajectories, plan stimulation programs, and predict long-term reservoir performance. Beyond the drilling and reservoir stimulation, the challenge of scaling EGS is also about engineering efficient, repeatable, and integrated systems. Baker Hughes approaches this with a focus on systems integration and performance optimization across every stage of geothermal development. The company’s Subsurface-to-Surface (S2S) workflow is a digitally integrated solution that connects subsurface models, microseismic monitoring, well designs, artificial lift configurations, surface power generation systems, and digital workflows. _“It’s not just the focus on individual technologies. As you scale, you will have to work with complex systems. We are talking about so many different variables that you can modify to make the system more efficient and optimized,”_ said Menon. _“Our S2S workflow actually connects all these processes and then digitizes them. This allows us to explore a lot of different scenarios.”_ On the drilling side, EGS presents one of the toughest environments: horizontal wells in hot, hard formations such as granite. These conditions produce extreme vibration and thermal stress, which can reduce tool life and performance. Baker Hughes applies a systems approach to this challenge, designing tools rated for high temperatures, implementing technologies to reduce vibration, and using fluids to reduce the temperatures at which the tools are exposed to. Putting all these technologies together is a key in scaling EGS, especially as EGS projects go to hotter environments and drill longer laterals. With EGS presenting a huge opportunity to scale, technology companies like Baker Hughes are also incentivized to develop new technologies for such environments. For example, the deep drilling tools developed for the IDDP-2 project in Iceland, though not widely commercialized at the time, now provide a technological foundation for EGS projects demanding even hotter and deeper wells. Beyond EGS, Baker Hughes continues to support a wide range of geothermal projects, from [conventional hydrothermal systems](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/democell-project-validates-geothermal-potential-in-lower-saxony-germany/) to [experimental single-well concepts](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/baker-hughes-reports-progress-on-wells2watts-geothermal-research-consortium/). The company’s experience in directional drilling, high-temperature completion tools, and surface facilities engineering enables it to support hybrid developments and novel geothermal configurations. Menon highlighted that many of the technologies developed for conventional geothermal have crossover applications to EGS. Baker Hughes has the largest installed base of geothermal Electric Submersible Pumps (ESPs) globally, and have worked extensively improve this technology. The work that the company has done on designing high-temperature, high-flow ESPs and improving the reliability of these systems, by mitigating scale formation for instance, can benefit both EGS and conventional geothermal systems. _“It all goes back to the whole S2S paradigm,”_ Menon said. _“Operators will want to take into account all the parameters of running an EGS project. This includes understanding the characteristics of the geothermal fluid and how it behaves after it has exited the wellbore. Good design of surface facilities is just as important in ensuring an efficient project.”_ In parallel with technological advancements, the geothermal sector is witnessing a significant shift in public and institutional awareness. A decade ago, geothermal was rarely mentioned in energy policy discussions. Today, EGS features prominently in conversations around energy security, baseload renewables, and decarbonization. “ _The fact that people outside the industry now ask about geothermal and EGS is a big change,”_ said Menon._“We’re seeing coverage in the media, government programs, and investor interest all rise sharply.”_ Menon also noted that the broader energy demand landscape is favorable to geothermal. With rising global electricity demand, all power generation sources are under pressure to expand. Unlike nuclear or other renewables, geothermal is very scalable in the near-term using existing oilfield infrastructure and a trained workforce. Baker Hughes is playing a pivotal role in enabling the next generation of geothermal energy through technologies that help scale EGS projects, as well other geothermal plays. By drawing from decades of experience in both geothermal and oil and gas, and by investing in purpose-built solutions, including fracture modeling, drilling technology, ESP systems, and integrated workflows, the company is helping transform EGS into a commercially viable and globally scalable energy solution.

The**[European Geothermal PhD Days](https://egpd2025.com/en/)** returned to Szeged, Hungary this year, after hosting it for the first time back in 2013. Bringing together researchers working on geothermal energy, this year’s event gave a platform to the leading researchers of tomorrow amidst the backdrop of [one of the most significant geothermal hotspots in Europe](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/szeged-hungary-increases-geothermal-district-heating-capacity/). The 16th edition of the European Geothermal PhD Days was held on April 2025 and was organized by the [University of Szeged](https://u-szeged.hu/english) in Hungary. Aside from bringing together a large number of participants from European universities to share their work, participants also visited Szeged’s district heating provider and an active drilling operation, where a well for the city’s nine-site geothermal system was being completed. The event was made possible through the support of the National Research, Development and Innovation Office’s Mecenatúra grant program, as well as contributions from organizations active in the field of geothermal energy. _“All participants are currently studying at European universities, but we also had students from Canada, Indonesia, and Kenya – countries where geothermal energy is widely utilized, including for electricity production,”_ said Dr. János Szanyi, the chair of the organizing committee for the 16th European Geothermal PhD Days. _“More importantly, these PhD students will become the leading researchers of tomorrow, and the conference offers a valuable opportunity for them to connect before moving on to careers in industry or advanced academic research. In fact, one of this year’s speakers first attended the event years ago as a student. Early connections like these often grow into long-term collaborations that help shape the field._ _The geothermal sector itself is a prime example of how even the largest countries in Europe – including Italy, Germany, and France – depend on close cooperation between research and industry to achieve lasting progress.”_ In Hungary, the University of Szeged stands out as a leading center for geothermal energy research. Its international reputation is further strengthened by Dr. János Szanyi’s role as coordinator of the Panel of Experts on Geothermal Energy within the European Federation of Geologists – one of the main reasons Szeged was chosen as the host city for this year’s event. Hungary itself plays a prominent role in the geothermal sector, a fact reflected in the strong presence of Hungarian experts within the field’s most influential international organizations. Among them is Professor László Rybach from the University of Zurich, who has been active in geothermal research since 1975 and previously served as president of the International Geothermal Association. Speaking at the conference, he emphasized how much the field has evolved over the past decades – and how it continues to offer significant opportunities for research and innovation. Dr. Miklós Antics, president of the [European Geothermal Energy Council](https://www.egec.org/) (EGEC), is another Hungarian expert who holds an influential position in a key international organization. At the conference, Dr. Antics explained, _“The EGEC is involved in several European programs, primarily to share knowledge with its members and to promote the use of geothermal energy at the European level. Research is essential to geothermal development – only through research can we reach the point where geothermal energy is produced economically.”_",

In a landmark move for industrial decarbonization, [Essity](https://www.essity.com/) and supplier Toscotec have completed the rebuild of a tissue machine at the Kawerau plant in New Zealand, enabling it to run entirely on geothermal steam. Essity is a global producer of paper/ tissue based health and hygiene products operating a plant at Kawerau. A tissue machine is a sophisticated piece of equipment that converts pulp into tissue paper. By following a series of intricate processes, including pulping, refining, sheet formation, drying, and finishing, the machine produces high-quality tissue products. The project involved retrofitting the existing PM5 tissue machine with Toscotec’s TT SYD Steel Yankee Dryer and an upgraded drying section. The machine is now fully powered by steam from a nearby geothermal power plant, eliminating the use of natural gas for this part of the process. This marks one of the first full conversions of a tissue machine to renewable geothermal steam. It represents a major step in Essity’s sustainability strategy, supporting its goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 35% by 2030 compared to 2016 levels. The Kawerau site, located in New Zealand’s Bay of Plenty region, is situated near a major geothermal field. The use of geothermal steam provides reliable, zero-emission energy for the drying process—traditionally one of the most energy-intensive steps in tissue production. Toscotec, a leading Italian supplier of tissue machinery, oversaw the engineering and installation work. The successful conversion demonstrates the potential for geothermal heat to decarbonize industrial operations beyond power generation.

    "content": "Geothermal Radar has launched an interactive global thermal model for identifying geothermal potential, with free, premium, and enterprise options. Early-stage startup [Geothermal Radar](https://www.geothermalradar.com/) has launched an exclusive global thermal model that enables users to exploit geothermal gradients across areas of interest. The global model pinpoints existing geothermal project locations to reveal further geothermal potential globally. Geothermal Radar is part of the EIC Rose Rock platform. Geothermal Radar features over 40 geospatial models to guide the presented geothermal maps and gradients. It supports engineered “closed loop” geothermal (CLG), engineered “open loop” (EGS), natural hydrothermal systems (NHS) and superhot rock (SHR) geothermal projects with temperatures starting at 374 degrees Celsius. The platform empowers governments to build national geothermal strategies, providing a reliable standard for awarding new geothermal licensing rounds. It also offers a single platform that energy companies, geothermal developers, and industrial partners can use to decarbonize facilities and buildings including data centers and oil and gas production facilities as well as LNG, ammonia, hydrogen, coal, steel, cement and carbon capture operations. It’s the only platform that supports the exploration of economic decarbonization on a global scale. Users can leverage the thermal meta-model aggregating information from all integrated isotherm models and data, and use Geothermal Radar’s global lithostatic pressure module to further rank locations. Geothermal Radar’s global thermal and pressure model connects to a techno-economic engine that allows users to assess and compare [engineered open loop](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/fervo-secures-206m-for-cape-station-development/) (FERVO-style) and [closed loop](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/eavor-targets-geothermal-power-production-at-gerestried-site-by-1h-2025/) (EAVOR-style) projects over the lifetime of a proposed project. _“The next energy revolution isn’t in the air or on the water; it’s underfoot.

    "title": "Grid stress and utility shifts: is geothermal ready?",
    "author": "Alexander Richter",
    "date": "20 Jun 2025",
    "content": "Data center electricity demand is reshaping U.S. power markets. Could geothermal provide clean, firm capacity as utilities face rising stress? The structure of the U.S. power sector is going through a fundamental shift. The rapid growth of AI-driven data centers is leading to a surge in electricity demand—demand that is now starting to outpace grid capacity and is putting pressure on traditional utility business models. It is therefore not surprising to see an increasing number of articles and studies addressing this development. According to the latest [_Horizons_ report by Wood Mackenzie](https://www.woodmac.com/horizons/us-data-centre-power-demand-challenges-electricity-market-model/?__FormGuid=737fa606-1f5f-4489-aec9-6b139fc288f7&__FormLanguage=en&__FormSubmissionId=ffb45f83-3213-4ceb-9e3f-4be6544cf75b), more than 130 GW of proposed data center capacity has now entered the development pipeline. This is more than double the capacity reported just one year ago. What is particularly noteworthy—based on Wood Mackenzie’s analysis—is that this growth is not limited to established tech hubs. It is now also expanding to other parts of the country, including Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Ohio. These are regions where local power systems are often less prepared for this scale of new load. For utilities, keeping pace with this trend is becoming increasingly difficult. They are caught between multiple pressures: ensuring grid reliability, avoiding stranded investments, and dealing with regulatory uncertainty. In regulated markets, some utilities are starting to respond with new large-load tariffs and faster generation planning. But in deregulated areas, where market prices are expected to drive investment, forward price signals are currently not sufficient to trigger new capacity. As a result, the gap between what data centers are planning and what the grid can provide continues to widen—raising concerns around system stability, financial risk, and who will ultimately pay for the necessary infrastructure. In this context, geothermal energy – particularly next-generation solutions like enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) – is receiving new attention as a possible clean and firm power source. A [March 2025 study by the Rhodium Group](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/could-geothermal-meet-rising-data-center-electricity-demand/), which we covered earlier this year, suggests that geothermal could supply a significant share of future electricity demand from data centers. In a scenario where these facilities continue to cluster around traditional infrastructure hubs, geothermal could meet up to 64% of the new load by the early 2030s. If data centers were to locate closer to strong geothermal resources, this figure could rise to 100%, with significantly lower electricity costs compared to grid-connected supply. Geothermal is especially well-suited for this type of application due to several key characteristics: high capacity factors, constant availability, and the possibility to operate behind the meter. This last point is important – especially as delays in grid interconnection and regional congestion are becoming more frequent. Being able to bypass the grid and deliver electricity directly to data center operations presents a clear strategic advantage. At the same time, geothermal plants have a relatively small land footprint, which is attractive for developers seeking reliable and space-efficient solutions. However, there are still barriers to overcome. Permitting processes – particularly on federal land – remain long and complex. How recent changes by the new U.S. administration will indeed on a broader scale help speed up those processes will have to be seen, yet [recent news are proimising](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/ormat-geothermal-projects-to-be-covered-by-us-emergency-permitting-procedures/) in that direction. In many states, [legal clarity around subsurface heat](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/who-owns-geothermal-heat-a-version-from-a-geologists-perspective/) rights is still lacking. And while investment into geothermal drilling and development is increasing, the supply chain and workforce are only beginning to scale. Furthermore, the independent power producer (IPP) model that most geothermal developers follow may face regulatory and contractual challenges, especially when entering procurement systems designed with other technologies in mind. A further question that often comes up in discussions is whether data center companies will actually invest in power generation directly – or if they will remain purely electricity buyers. In the past, most preferred to rely on utility partnerships and renewable energy credits. But this could be changing. Companies such as [Google are engaging beyond power purchase agreements](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/fervo-and-google-geothermal-power-facility-starts-grid-supply/), but how and if [they are actively investing in clean energy supply](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/google-cloud-partners-with-slb-project-innerspace-for-geothermal-resource-identification/), including geothermal will have to be seen. In select cases, there are early signals that hyperscale developers may enter into direct contracts with IPPs, especially if the projects can deliver firm, hourly-matched clean power that aligns with corporate climate targets. This could open new opportunities for geothermal developers – particularly those able to offer behind-the-meter or co-located solutions. It would, however, also require new forms of collaboration and risk-sharing between project developers, investors, and corporate buyers – something that will not happen automatically, but needs to be designed and built. As Wood Mackenzie points out, this is not only a matter of energy supply – it is a question of how the electricity market is structured. If utilities and competitive power markets are not able to deliver at the speed and scale that is now required, other models will have to emerge. Geothermal may not have been developed with AI infrastructure in mind, but its characteristics make it a compelling option for addressing the combined challenges of reliability, emissions, and load concentration. Whether the sector can take on this role will depend on more than technology – it will require faster permitting, clearer regulation, willingness to partner with new types of buyers, and a much more ambitious approach to scaling deployment in the years ahead. **Sources:**[Wood Mackenzie Horizons White Paper – June 2025](https://www.woodmac.com), [Rhodium Group Report – March 2025](https://rhg.com/research/geothermal-data-centers/) Tags SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE * Follow Think GeoEnergy * [About Us](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/about/) * [Terms & Condition](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/about/terms-conditions/) * [Privacy Policy](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/about/privacy-policy/) * [Advertisement](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/advertisement/) * [Our Advertisers](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/our-advertisers/) * [Support](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/support-us/) * [ENGLISH](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/) * [EN ESPAÑOL](http://www.piensageotermia.com/) * [IN TURKISH](http://www.jeotermalhaberler.com/) All rights reserved. © ThinkGeoEnergy ehf. 2025 We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The upcoming [Praxisforum Geothermie.Bayern](https://www.praxisforum-geothermie.bayern/), October 22-24, 2025 will close with a field visit to two major projects that underscore the growing role of deep geothermal energy in Bavaria. MTU Aero Engines’ geothermal system The first stop of the “GeoTHOUR” on 24 October will be the newly built geothermal facility of MTU Aero Engines AG in northern Munich. The DAX-40 company is the first of its kind in Germany to implement a deep geothermal project. Once fully operational, the plant is expected to replace up to 80% of the site’s natural gas demand for heating. The facility will shift from test operation to regular use later this year, serving as a model for industrial decarbonisation. Grünwald aiming for 100% geothermal heat The second highlight is the new drilling site of Erdwärme Grünwald GmbH in the south of Munich district. Building on its existing plant, the municipal utility aims to cover the entire heat demand of Grünwald’s 11,000 residents with renewable geothermal energy. If successful, the town will become the first municipality in Germany with a 100% geothermal heat supply. About the event The Praxisforum Geothermie.Bayern, held 22–24 October 2025, brings together professionals, policymakers, and industry players. The program includes workshops, a conference day on challenges and developments, and concludes with the “GeoTHOUR” site visits.

A central highlight was the visit to the **Larderello geothermal area** , widely recognized as the cradle of geothermal electricity generation. The visit was hosted by the Province of Livorno and Enel Green Power, which operates the geothermal plants in the region. Participants from Portugal, Finland, Latvia, Czech Republic, Romania, Spain, Hungary, Belgium, North Macedonia, and Italy explored key geothermal installations across Pomarance, Castelnuovo Val di Cecina, and Monterotondo Marittimo. **Exploring Italy’s geothermal heartland** The study tour included technical briefings by Enel Green Power’s geothermal team, site visits to the **Valle Secolo geothermal power plant** ((Continental) Europe’s largest at 120 MW), and a walk through the **Geothermal Museum in Larderello**. Attendees experienced the dramatic geothermal landscape firsthand, including natural steam manifestations and the “**urlo della Terra** ” (Earth’s roar) from a demonstrative well. Beyond power generation, the group explored direct-use applications of geothermal heat, such as: * **District heating systems** for nearly 10,000 residents in 9 municipalities * **Geothermal-powered agribusiness** , including the [Vapori di Birra](https://www.vaporidibirra.com/en/) brewery and [Podere Paterno](https://passionetoscana.com/collections/podere-paterno?srsltid=AfmBOoqQ3s4wzW3vAxSFllXQ8hdkK2IZboL6Ndx2CnZHYeSdmLeEwhkE) cheese farm * **Sustainable drying of biomass** , showcasing circular economy principles **A platform for knowledge exchange** The Promoter initiative aims to foster interregional cooperation on climate-related policies. The visit to Tuscany served as a hands-on platform for exchanging good practices in renewable energy integration, mobility planning, and energy communities. Discussions also covered the development of **renewable energy communities** , electric mobility infrastructure, and information systems like BonTime, which supports sustainable transport planning. **Legacy of geothermal innovation** Tuscany’s geothermal fields, operated by Enel Green Power, include 34 geothermal power plants with **37 production units**. These generate nearly **6 TWh annually** , meeting over **30% of the region’s electricity needs** and accounting for **70% of renewable energy in Tuscany**. The area also attracts 60,000 visitors per year, underlining its role in energy education and tourism. Geothermal power in Tuscany dates back to 1904, when Prince Ginori Conti first lit five lightbulbs using geothermal steam. The region’s legacy continues to inspire innovation, positioning it as a model for sustainable energy and regional development. A final workshop on June 10 will review lessons learned and support the implementation of over 20 best practices gathered across previous study visits, including those in Portugal, Romania, and the Baltics.",

A feature article published by Iceland’s [GRO International Centre for Capacity Development, Sustainability, and Societal Change](https://www.grocentre.is/gro) highlights Kunzes Dolma, an alumna of the GRO Geothermal Training Programme (GRO GTP) and the first women to be trained in the geothermal profession in India. Since her return, Kunzes has been promoting the use of geothermal in the Ladakh region, but has advocated for gender equality and the participation of women in decision-making in Ladakh. Kunzes attended the GRÓ Geothermal Training Programme in Iceland in 2017, where she specialized in geothermal utilization. _“At that time not much was done in India to utilize the low temp fields that we have and so I took the opportunity to learn,”_ Kunzes explains. _“I saw the impact that geothermal development had made to Iceland which otherwise used to be a poor country a few decades back. And so, I was motivated to do the same back in my country, the fact that most of the geothermal sites in India are in remote areas, made me think more of promoting this energy for not only infrastructure development, but also for the community. Geothermal is my passion now,”_ Kunzes further reflect. Upon her return to Ladakh, she started a greenhouse project using geothermal heat to grow vegetables in winter time. She also started raising funds to provide geothermal space heating for the Puga residential school. Her early work led to the decision of the India Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) to undertake the development of geothermal in Puga, where [a 1-MW development is currently being eyed.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-drilling-resumes-for-puga-valley-geothermal-project-ladakh-india/) Her time in Iceland also inspired Kunzes to advocate for gender equality and the welfare of women, particularly those who are experiencing domestic violence. _“Many women are forced to live in the house where they are assaulted, due to the absence of a women shelter where they would otherwise live safely and fight for justice,”_ she stated. With this experience, she has played a part in the plans to put up the first women’s shelter in Ladakh, as well as a cradle centre, where children can be left safely when their mothers are unable to care for them. Kunzes is also acting as India’s Ambassador for [Women in Geothermal](https://womeningeothermal.org/) (WING), a global organization aimed at promoting the professional development and advancement of women in the geothermal industry. Her efforts to promote gender equality in decision-making at state level have bore fruit. The Ministry of Home Affairs announced that there will be a 33% reservation for women in the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development of Leh and Kargil. _“This will come into implementation soon and this is history for Ladakh,”_ says Kunzes. **[Read the whole feature article via this link.](https://www.grocentre.is/gro/media/news/category/1/kunzes-dolma-gro-gtp-alumna-a-pioneer-in-advancing-geothermal-energy-and-gender-equality)**",

    "title": "Germany publishes new draft for proposed Geothermal Energy Acceleration Act",
    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "23 Jul 2025",
    "content": "Germany has published a new draft for a proposed Geothermal Energy Acceleration Act which expands upon measures to facilitate exploration and approvals. The [Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy](https://www.bundeswirtschaftsministerium.de/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html) (BMWE) of Germany has published a new draft bill for the Geothermal Energy Acceleration Act (GeoBG) which will be the country’s first-ever geothermal energy law. The Ministry opened a public comment period on the draft, drawing responses from various associated organizations. With the deadline for comments now over, the organizations have released official statements reflecting their stance on the draft law. Compared to the draft of the previous coalition government, [then called the GeoWG](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/experts-in-germany-express-support-for-geothermal-acceleration-act/), the new GeoBG draft includes provisions to facilitate seismic measurements along paved roads, allowing for more measurements per year. The draft also proposes faster approval procedures through fixed deadlines and digital processes, and a legal clarification of the overriding public interest of geothermal. The [German Geothermal Association](https://www.geothermie.de/) (BVG) expressed their support for the draft law, praising it in many respects while also providing inputs for how it can be improved. Specifically, the current draft does not provide for any simplifications in the review of project sites with regard to their suitability for a nuclear repository. Until now, even for small facilities such as those in single-family homes, drilling at depths of 100 meters or more requires an assessment of whether a repository is feasible at that location. _“That doesn’t make sense, because repositories are only technically feasible at depths of 300 or even 400 meters. Therefore, we continue to consider shifting this limit important and hope for improvements in this area in the further legislative process,”_ said Gregor Dilger, Managing Director of BVG. _“With this draft, the federal government recognizes the urgency of expanding renewable technologies for the heat transition. In particular, the proposed classification of infrastructure projects as projects of overriding public interest is a key step toward closing existing legal loopholes,”_ said Dr. Simone Peter, the President of the [German Renewable Energy Association](https://www.bee-ev.de/) (BEE). _“This will significantly shorten lengthy approval procedures and accelerate expansion. This sends a positive message not only to industry, project developers, and municipalities, but also to all consumers.”_ The [German Association of the Energy and Water Industries](https://www.bdew.de/) (BDEW) considers the draft law as a sound basis for the expansion of geothermal as climate-neutral heat supply, citing many of its positive aspects. However, the association calls for widening the scope of application and definitions in the draft to include all relevant types of systems, such as smaller heating and storage systems. The BVG further calls for measures to ensure equal treatment with other forms of energy, such as wind energy, and thus the full implementation of EU directives. Among other things, the preferential building regulations in open areas and the provision of public spaces through the Geothermal Energy Acceleration Act are to be addressed. Likewise, the German Geothermal Association is calling for the designation of acceleration areas for all forms of geothermal energy to ensure the full implementation of the Renewable Energy Directive – similar to wind energy. _“Geothermal energy can make a key contribution to climate protection, long-term stable energy prices, and security of supply. Geothermal energy is available everywhere and at any time. No fuels need to be imported for its use, nor do their supply routes need to be secured. And technologically, we in Germany have all the expertise in-house,”_ concluded Dilger.",

Slovakia’s Ministry of Environment has approved support for a geothermal-based heating project in Ve?ká Lomnica, marking another step toward cleaner and more efficient energy use in the country. The project, backed with more than EUR 746,000 from the Environmental Fund, will enable Lomnická Teplárenská to modernize its heating system and expand the use of geothermal heat from an existing well for both electricity and heat production. **Boosting efficiency and cutting emissions** According to Deputy Prime Minister and Environment Minister Tomás Taraba, Slovakia has the right conditions for wider geothermal use. “We are ready to support every realistic, high-quality and meaningful project that will enable the production of energy from this renewable source in the future,” he said. The new system will supply heat to a golf course, family homes, and apartment buildings in Ve?ká Lomnica. Once completed, it is expected to double the efficiency of heat distribution from 235 MWhs annually to more than 505 MWh. The project should also cut carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 145 tons per year. Implementation is planned within eight months to ensure no disruption during the peak heating season. The ministry has so far supported 27 projects across Slovakia through its hybrid modernization call, with a total funding volume of EUR 149 million. A new call for proposals is expected soon, giving municipalities further opportunity to apply for support.

    "content": "LIAG has published a traffic light map showing the potential for installation of probes for near-surface geothermal energy covering the entire Germany. The [Leibniz Institute for Applied Geophysics](https://www.leibniz-liag.de/index.html) (LIAG) has published a new version of a traffic light map that highlights the potential for near-surface geothermal in Germany. The map is now freely available in the GeotIS geothermal information system. **[Click here to access the geothermal map in GeotIS.](https://www.geotis.de/geotisapp/geotis.php)** The interactive map was developed as part of the [WärmeGut](http://www.waermegut.de/) research project led by the LIAG Institute for Applied Geophysics (LIAG) in Hanover, the Georg August University of Göttingen (UGOE), and geoENERGIE Konzept GmbH from Freiberg, in collaboration with all 16 state geological surveys. The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWE) is funding the project. [A previous version of the map](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/liag-publishes-traffic-light-map-for-geothermal-probes-in-germany/) was announced in early 2024, covering only the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern region. _“Together with our project partners and the state geological surveys, we have succeeded in developing a digital map that meets the individual requirements of each federal state while also providing an easily understandable standardization of the complex data situation,_ ” explains project leader Prof. Dr. Inga Moeck. _“This is a historic milestone for geothermal research.”_ The traffic light map provides straightforward guidance on whether the installation of geothermal probes is possible or not in any locality. Green marks regions where geothermal probes can be used without restrictions, yellow indicates restricted usage, and red indicates areas that are not suitable for use. Clicking on a specific map area opens a window with further information and links to the relevant authority in the respective federal state for contact and detailed information. The researchers are hoping that the clarity offered by the interactive map will help communities, cities, and municipalities in deciding to develop geothermal as a suitable and secure heat source for the future. Geothermal remains an overlooked form of renewable energy, which is unfortunate given its benefits over wind and solar. _“Without geothermal energy, the heat transition cannot succeed,”_ says Moeck. _“We expect this map to draw attention to geothermal energy as a measure in municipal heat planning and to provide a decisive boost to both the energy transition and scientific geothermal research.”_ Moeck’s research team is working on additional maps for shallow geothermal technologies, such as collector and well systems. The traffic light maps form the basis for interactive potential maps that can be used to calculate the usable thermal energy for a specific location. This will significantly support municipal heat planning and bring Germany one step closer to climate-neutral heat supply.",

Early studies on producing green hydrogen at the Ulubelu site [were first announced in 2021.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/pge-to-evaluate-green-hydrogen-production-at-ulubelu-geothermal-site/) The pilot plant will serve as a center for technology learning, testing of commercial feasibility, and further studies on demand and product quality. The facility will integrate Anion Exchange Membrane (AEM) electrolyzer technology, making it a global pioneer in the use of this technology for green hydrogen production. Yuliot Tanjung, Deputy Minsiter of Energy and Mineral Resource (ESDM), commended PGEO for carrying out a business transformation that now includes both geothermal power and green hydrogen. Renewable energies will eventually disrupt fossil fuel production, which is the core business of parent company PT Pertamina (Persero). With green hydrogen production, the state-owned energy company now has two complementary renewable energies in their portfolio. Simon Aloysius Mantiri, President Director of PT Peramina (Persero) added that the groundbreaking of the green hydrogen pilot plant is in line with the goal of the Pertamina group to be world-class clean energy company. With this intiative, the company aims to provie that geothermal-based green hydrogen technology can be implemented effectively. The project also lays the foundation for hydrogen regulations, standards, and business models in Indonesia that can be replicated in other regions. In early 2024, PT PLN [started operations on a green hydrogen production facility at the Kamojang geothermal power plant](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/kamojang-geothermal-power-plant-in-indonesia-starts-green-hydrogen-production/), making it the first geothermal-based green hydrogen produced in Southeast Asia.",

    "content": "Exploration drilling for geothermal energy in Magglingen in Switzerland is expected to start by the end of 2027 following the results of a seismic survey. Exploratory drilling for the Magglingen geothermal project in Switzerland is planned to start by the end of 2027. The goal for the well would be provide information to evaluate whether the deep water be used for a geothermal plant at the Federal Office of Sport’s (FOSP) National Sports Center in Magglingen. If exploration drilling is successful, the well can likely begin supplying heat to the Magglingen National Sports Center of the [Federal Office of Sport](https://www.baspo.admin.ch/de) (FOSP) by 2029. In 2023, the Federal Office for Climate Protection (BBL)[ conducted an underground survey in the region around Magglingen](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/seismic-campaign-for-geothermal-prospecting-to-start-in-magglingen-switzerland/). The aim of the extensive investigations was to obtain the most precise possible geological map of Magglingen’s subsurface and to gain insights into potential warm deep water sources for geothermal heat generation. The analysis of the collected data suggests several potential deep water reservoirs. From this initial image of the subsurface, the course and location of geological layers and faults can be derived. Due to the complex subsurface beneath Magglingen, an area of uncertainty remains in the interpretation of this data and the resulting model. Further measures and investigations are intended to further reduce the uncertainty and the associated risk of failure in any drilling operation. Exploratory drilling is necessary for many geothermal projects because the exact location of the deep water is uncertain and key parameters such as water temperature, water volume, and flow rate are unknown. These factors are crucial for the economic use of the deep water. The planned exploratory drilling at a depth of approximately 1,500 to 2,300 meters will reduce existing uncertainties and project risks. At the same time, it will provide important insights into the subsurface. The implementation of the exploratory drilling and the drilling for deep water utilization requires funding approval from the Federal Parliament. The Federal Office for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FOBL) will compile the costs of the drilling by the end of 2025 and will likely present them to Parliament as part of the 2026 Real Estate Dispatch. In addition to funding approval from Parliament, drilling permits from the cantonal authorities are also required for the drilling for deep water utilization. These investigations are part of many other measures being taken by the Federal Office of Public Safety (BBL) to reduce environmental impacts at the Federal Office of Public Safety (FOSP) site. For example, a district heating network for most of the FOSPO buildings in Magglingen was completed last year, powered by wood pellets from a temporary energy center. In addition, the appropriate infrastructure at the Magglingen National Sports Center is being continuously equipped with photovoltaic systems.",

    "content": "GreenFire Energy has launched a demonstration project in The Geysers, California that shows geothermal energy production from existing near-idle wells. Early test results, using an existing geothermal well are extremely positive, providing a potential foundation for what’s possible using next-gen geothermal technology in steam dominated reservoirs. The demonstration project’s early performance marks a meaningful leap in geothermal recovery efficiency, highlighting GreenFire Energy’s ability to boost output in mature fields like The Geysers. The system, installed in a low-output well nearing idle status, is now fully operational. Initial results show sustained flow rates between 300-350 gpm (19-22 L/s) with higher-than-expected output temperatures at 310 F (154 °C) in a stable closed-loop system. GreenFire Energy enhances heat recovery by leveraging natural convection and optimizing saturation pressure within the reservoir, while maintaining a closed-loop flow in the liquid phase to bring heat to the surface. This approach enables efficient energy transfer, potentially unlocking more power from existing well infrastructure in places like The Geysers and other geothermal fields while still preserving water mass in the reservoir. Two seven-day production tests have already been completed, step-change testing is complete in both forward- and reverse-flow configurations, and an industry-standard duration steady-state test is nearly complete. These series of high-flow tests are designed to validate performance across multiple operating conditions and applicability in other low-output wells showing the scalability in geothermal fields. This [California Energy Commission-funded demonstration project](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/greenfire-energy-awarded-funding-for-demonstration-project-at-the-geysers/) is expected to be completed in June. By matching technology to geology and combining patented systems with field-optimized practices, the project demonstrates a proven path to accelerate geothermal development using next-gen solutions. _“This is a breakthrough—not just for our team, but for the future of geothermal,_ ” said Rob Klenner**,** President of GreenFire Energy. _“_ _The ability to demonstrate a successful test at The Geysers is one of the biggest impacts the industry needs right now to scale new geothermal energy to the grid.

Established in 2015, the FAST- 41 designation, granted under Title 41 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, ensures a transparent federal permitting process committed to supporting large-scale infrastructure projects of national importance. FAST-41 covered projects are entitled to comprehensive permitting timetables and transparent, collaborative management of those timetables on the Federal Permitting Dashboard. The FAST-41 program highlights infrastructure vital to U.S. resilience, providing direct agency coordination, enforceable permitting timelines, and transparent oversight. This designation reflects the federal government’s commitment to restoring industrial capability, securing critical inputs, and accelerating high-impact clean energy development. This designation also elevates Hell’s Kitchen as a recognized strategic asset to the United States and signals strong backing from the White House and the National Energy Dominance Council. _“FAST-41 Coverage signifies a critical federal recognition of the Hell’s Kitchen Project,”_ said Rod Colwell, CEO of Controlled Thermal Resources. _“To qualify, projects must meet rigorous criteria, and we are honored to be recognized as a priority development by the Trump Administration.”_ Located southeast of the Salton Sea Geothermal Field in Imperial Valley, CA, the Hell’s Kitchen Critical Minerals and Power Project aims to provide the first in a series of American minerals extraction and conversion production facilities powered by geothermal energy. If permitted, this project will supply a number of critical minerals that meet market grade requirements. The proposed power plant will convert geothermal brine into steam to generate electrical energy. Both the steam and the electrical energy will be used in the extraction of lithium and other minerals from that same geothermal brine for onsite conversion into battery-grade lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate for use in the battery industry. Hell’s Kitchen will deliver two essential pillars of national security: domestically sourced critical minerals for defense and domestic manufacturing, and reliable 24/7 renewable baseload power to support the growing demands of hyperscale data centers and AI infrastructure. _“I’m pleased to welcome the Hell’s Kitchen Critical Minerals and Power Project to FAST-41 coverage,”_ said Emily Domenech, Permitting Council Executive Director. _“This innovative combined mining and processing effort is exactly the kind of next generation project the Permitting Council should enable. I look forward to working with industry and federal partners to unlock our country’s vast energy and mineral resources and reduce our reliance on China.”_ The project’s designation triggers a statutorily mandated process, including 21 days for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to invite cooperating agencies and a 60-day window to develop a Coordinated Project Plan and permitting timetable. Located in Imperial County, California – America’s second-largest producer of geothermal energy – the Hell’s Kitchen project will initially generate 50 WM of geothermal power and 25,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide monohydrate. Additional stages are expected to produce up to 500 MW of renewable power and 175,000 metric tons of lithium annually. [The groundbreaking ceremony](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/ctr-breaks-ground-on-geothermal-and-lithium-facility-in-california/) for the project was held in early 2024. _“CTR’s capacity to deliver essential resources needed to power America’s future cannot be overstated,”_ Rod Colwell added. _“We have an extraordinary resource and the proven technology to commence construction at scale. We applaud the federal government’s decisive and efficient actions to accelerate development, encourage private investment, and create thousands of good-paying American jobs.”_",

With the approval of Governor Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota, [Senate Bill 2360](https://legiscan.com/ND/bill/SB2360/2025) has been passed, mandating the conduct of a feasibility study on developing geothermal energy in the state. Part of this study will be an evaluation on the use of nonproductive oil and gas wells to generate geothermal energy through the use of a complementary energy extraction method. The bipartisan bill was sponsored by Senators Claire Cory (R-Grand Forks), Kathy Hogan (D-Fargo), and Dale Patten (R-Watford City). The bill states that the feasibility study shall include an evaluation of: * The state’s geology and the feasibility of resource exploration and production of geothermal energy in the state; * Support opportunities for startup geothermal companies, including fostering innovation and promoting economic growth within the state’s energy sector; * The application of geothermal energy to nonproductive oil and gas wells to extend the life of the well through the use of a complementary energy extraction method; * Other opportunities to advance geothermal energy opportunities in the state. The findings and recommendations of the study, including any proposed legislation required to implement the recommendations, shall be presented at the 70th legislative assembly. Speaking at the North Dakota Senate Energy and Natural Resource Committee Hearing for SB 2360 last February, Jessica Eagle-Bluestone of [Geothermal Rising](https://geothermal.org/) provided testimony on how North Dakota can benefit from geothermal energy development: _“North Dakota has long been an energy leader.

    "content": "New Zealand is progressing with supercritical geothermal research, with the site of the first exploratory well expected to be finalized later this year. The Government of New Zealand is on the process of identify potential drilling sites as part of their research efforts on supercritical geothermal energy, according to an update given by Regional Development Minister Shane Jones and Science, Innovation, and Technology Minister Shane Reti. The location of the first well is expected to be finalized later this year. _“We need to drill an exploratory deep well to prove the commercial viability of supercritical geothermal energy. We are about a year from starting to drill but we are getting closer to locating potential geothermal fields in the Taupo Volcanic Zone,”_ said Mr Jones. _“With the search for potential exploratory well sites being narrowed down, we need to develop and prove the drilling and engineering systems for extracting the energy. Supercritical geothermal wells require casing materials that can withstand both high temperatures and potentially corrosive supercritical fluids,”_ added Dr Reti. _“I’m issuing a challenge to the New Zealand science and research community – academics, scientists and industry – help us find the solution. A lot of innovative research is happening across the country in pockets that could lead to the solution we need. It will be through these experts and sectors coming together and working collaboratively that we will crack this.”_ Last year, the New Zealand Government announced tha[t it will be allocating up to $60 million](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-zealand-to-invest-60-million-on-supercritical-geothermal-research/) from the Regional Infrastructure Fund to explore the potential of supercritical geothermal technology (SCGT). From this fund, $5 million will be drawn down for the work on the detailed designs and costs of drilling of the first exploratory well. The [Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/) (MBIE) and [GNS Science](https://www.gns.cri.nz/) are leading the initiative. The MBIE has thus far set up a Supercritical Geothermal Governance Group to oversee, advise, and support the successful delivery of the project. The project partners had previously engaged with iwi on the project, ensuring a holistic and inclusive strategy that incorporates Maori expertise and economic development.

    "date": "15 Apr 2025",
    "content": "Geothermal PPAs are rising fast as data centers and corporations seek 24/7 clean power. Discover how this shift drives new geothermal energy growth globally. Is the geothermal energy sector entering a new phase of growth? Driven by a surge in electricity demand and the need for reliable, round-the-clock renewable power there are indications that indeed this is the case. While solar and wind have long led the way in green energy procurement, a rising wave of geothermal power purchase agreements (PPAs) is positioning geothermal as a critical player in the global energy transition. **Why geothermal PPAs are growing** For years, corporate and utility PPAs favored solar and wind due to falling costs and rapid deployment. But now, geothermal’s unique value—24/7 stable, clean electricity—is capturing attention. It’s particularly well-suited for organizations that can’t afford power interruptions, such as data centers. In the United States alone, more than a dozen new geothermal PPAs have been signed since 2019. Tech leaders like Google and Meta are leading this trend, signing large-scale deals to ensure constant clean energy for their operations. **Data Centers: a major driver of demand** Data centers are expanding rapidly, fueled by AI, cloud computing, and digital infrastructure. By 2030, they could consume 9% of all U.S. electricity. Unlike intermittent renewables, geothermal can meet these high, always-on energy needs, as also recently pointed to in a research report by Rhodium Group by * Just in, [Fervo Energy signing 31 MW PPA with Shell Energy](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250415938962/en/Fervo-Energy-Announces-31-MW-Power-Purchase-Agreement-With-Shell-Energy) (with now a fully contracted 500 MW of Fervo’s Cape Station in Utah). * [Google signed a 10-MW PPA with Baseload Capital](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/google-baseload-capital-ink-geothermal-ppa-in-taiwan/) in Taiwan (including an equity deal). * [Google signed a 115 MW PPA](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/google-to-increase-geothermal-power-supply-to-data-centers-via-nevada-utility/) with Fervo Energy in Nevada, delivering geothermal power via NV Energy by 2026. * [Meta is partnering with Sage Geosystems](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/meta-signs-150-mw-geothermal-power-purchase-agreement-with-sage-geosystems/) for up to 150 MW of geothermal power by 2027. * Analysts suggest [geothermal could serve 64% of new data center power demand](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/could-geothermal-meet-rising-data-center-electricity-demand/) through 2030 in the U.S. **Global Growth in Geothermal PPAs** Beyond the U.S., geothermal PPAs are gaining momentum globally, supported by local policy and rising corporate commitments to net-zero targets. **U.S.** Just in today, [Fervor signed a 31 MW PPA with Shell Energy](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/fervo-signs-31-mw-geothermal-ppa-with-shell-energy/) for its Cape Station geothermal project upping the totally contracted amount to 500 MW of this groundbreaking large-EGS project. **Taiwan** As we reported today, [Google signed a 10 MW PPA with Baseload Capital](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/google-baseload-capital-ink-geothermal-ppa-in-taiwan/) and made an equity investment to help unlock up to 60 GW of geothermal potential. **Japan** **Philippines** **Policy support remains key** Policy incentives continue to shape the geothermal PPA landscape, creating more attractive conditions for investment and development. **Country Policy Tool Impact** * U.S. Renewable Portfolio Standards Boosts geothermal PPAs, e.g., [California’s 60% goal](https://www.energy.ca.gov/about/core-responsibility-fact-sheets/developing-renewable-energy) * Turkey [YEKDEM Feed-in Tariff](https://futureenergygo.com/turkeys-feed-in-tariff-for-renewable-energy-sources-support-and-yekdem-2022-outlook/) drove capacity from 100 MW (2010) to over 1 GW * [Philippines Geothermal Service Contracts](https://doe.gov.ph/renewable-energy/geothermal-service-contract-gsc-applications-31-december-2023) Supports consistent PPA growth for local utilities **Why geothermal is gaining value** Geothermal energy is standing out in today’s energy mix because it uniquely meets the need for baseload, emissions-free power—something solar and wind can’t deliver alone. Key advantages of geothermal in PPAs sound like the usual rant on why geothermal is a great choice with things like corporate sustainability alignment, reducing CO? at scale and policy compatibility with RPS, FITs, and green tariffs, practical implications for data centers are likely more driving, such as 24/7 power for high-demand users like data centers, and grid stability, complementing variable renewables. **What’s next for geothermal energy?** The convergence of data center growth, corporate clean energy goals, and supportive policy frameworks is fueling a shift. **Geothermal PPAs are no longer niche – they are strategic.** With major untapped potential in markets like Taiwan, Japan, East Africa, and Latin America, and with innovations like enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) on the horizon, geothermal energy is poised to scale. **Conclusion: the geothermal opportunity** Geothermal PPAs are emerging as a key tool to deliver the stable, clean power the world needs. From big tech to rural utilities, organizations are recognizing geothermal’s unmatched reliability and value. As the world moves toward net-zero, geothermal is not just part of the transition – it’s powering it.

    "content": "Colombia's ANLA has released a statement clarifying that gradient well drilling for geothermal exploration is not subject to environmental licensing. The [National Environmental Licensing Authority](https://www.anla.gov.co/) (Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales / ANLA) of Colombia has released a concept note stating that thermal gradient wells, as part of geothermal energy activities, will not considered subject to environmental licensing. The note defines thermal gradient wells as thin shallow boreholes, with depths ranging from 50 to several hundred meters, intended to measure at depth and assess the potential of the geothermal resource in the area of interest during exploration. Since these are drilled for the purpose of geological and geophysical observation, they are not subject to environmental licensing and do not require a prior approval from the ANLA. This procedure can be carried out as a preliminary step or in parallel with a project’s environmental assessment process, without prejudice to any permits for the use and exploitation of natural resources that may be processed before regional environmental authorities, if applicable. However, the letter emphasizes that other geothermal exploration activities that directly affect the reservoir and may generate significant environmental impacts are still subject to environmental licensing. In these cases, ANLA will assist the owners in complying with regulations on environmental management and the evaluation and monitoring of impacts on aquifers and groundwater systems. ANLA also mentioned that the agency is cooperating the Government of Iceland to strengthen the knowledge, institutions, and regulations in the development of geothermal energy in Colombia with the goal of adopting international standards and best practices. Earlier this year, the Government of Colombia[ announced a list of seven geothermal sites with high geothermal potential](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/colombia-aims-for-first-geothermal-auction-of-seven-strategic-areas/) that will be made available through a tender.",

    "date": "7 May 2025",
    "content": "A new sports park has been completed in Budapest, Hungary that highlights a pioneering energy system with geothermal-based heating at its core. The use of geothermal for heating and hot water supply has become a highlight of the newly built MTK Budapest Sports Park in the middle of the former industrial area on Kerepesi Street in Budapest. The geothermal heating system complements the nearly 1000 solar panels that provide 500 kW of electricity to the facility, combining for a pioneering energy system focused on sustainability and reliability. Work on the MTK Sports Park started in 2023 and has been headed by [Bayer Construct Zrt](https://bayerconstruct.hu/en/). The complex was built on almost 100,000 square meters of land and includes a multifunctional hall, indoor garage, and outdoor courts. Geothermal heat is supplied by a deviated production well drilled to 1300 meters depth. Heat from the water is recovered, then the water goes back to the subsurface via a reinjection well. On the surface, both wells are located right next to each other. By using directional drilling, the wells are spaced at a distance of almost 1000 meters in the subsurface. The geothermal heating scheme of the MTK Sports Park represents the first geothermal supply agreement signed by the [ Regulated Activities Supervisory Authority](https://sztfh.hu/) (SZTFH), under the new legislation that stipulates that thermal water extracted for geothermal utilization must be injected back into the geological medium. This legislation [came into force in March 2023.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/hungary-amends-laws-to-create-geothermal-framework/) The project was also an important milestone for the construction company Bayer Construct, as it is their first project to use a geothermal-based heating system. Thus, it serves as their introduction of a new geothermal business. The geothermal heat and hot water supply at MTK Sports Park was officially commissioned on 1 March 2205, in the presence of Energy Minister Csaba Lantos. At the ceremony, the Minister emphasized that Hungary is particularly blessed with abundant geothermal resources thanks to the excellent conditions in the Carpathian Basin.",

    "content": "The \"DeepHeat\" project which aims to characterize superhot geothermal resources in New Zealand has received further $10.69 million from the Endeavor Fund. The “DeepHeat” research programme, which seeks to investigate superhot geothermal resources in New Zealand, will receive $10.69 million from the 2025 Endeavor Fund. The project is one of 19 programmes that were selected for the funding, which seeks to support science-based projects to strengthen the economy and deliver benefits to New Zealanders. The **“DeepHeat”** programme is led by [Earth Sciences New Zealand](https://earthsciences.nz/) (formerly GNS Science & National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research) with a team that brings together experts from Victoria University Wellington and the University of Auckland. The programme will work alongside a wider network of scientists, engineers, AI experts, and M?ori advisors, as well as international partners from the USA, Switzerland, Japan, and Iceland. The research seeks to investigate how superhot fluids move at depth, specifically within the Central Taupo Volcanic Zone. Tapping into these superhot reservoirs can potentially unlock around 30,000 GWh of continuous renewable power each year. Realising this potential requires new knowledge at the frontier of science and engineering. Thus, part of the objectives of the programme are developing AI-driven reservoir models, conducting fracture network experiments, and assessing wellbore performance. The programme also aims to advance stimulation and well-integration technologies, evaluate energy and economic scenarios, establish environmental monitoring frameworks, and co-design Maori-led business models to ensure long-term sustainable benefits. “ _As New Zealand’s electricity demand continues to grow, so will our dependence on new energy sources. Geothermal fields aren’t impacted by the weather like other renewable energy sources such as hydro, solar, and wind, representing an important opportunity for our energy security,”_ said Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Dr Shane Reti. _“This programme is part of more than $183 million in funding we’re investing in projects that have the potential to shape New Zealand’s future – from space technologies to healthcare, artificial intelligence, and clean energy.”_ _“ These outputs are parallel to [the](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-zealand-to-invest-60-million-on-supercritical-geothermal-research/)[ government’s $60 million drilling programme](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-zealand-to-invest-60-million-on-supercritical-geothermal-research/) and the renaissance of geothermal exploration in New Zealand. They strengthen our chance to achieve a fast global development of superhot geothermal, setting New Zealand as the ideal international_ _test bed location,”_ added Co-Lead Scientist Isabelle Chambefort.",

    "content": "The city of Oradea in Romania has officially inaugurated its first geothermal heating plant in Nufarul, contributing 15% of the city's heating needs. The Municipality of Oradea in Romania has officially inaugurated their first geothermal heating plant located in the Nufarul I neighborhood. The system supplies heat for approximately 6000 apartments. With the facility online, geothermal now supplies 15% of the thermal energy produced in Oradea. Plans for a geothermal heating plant in Oradea were first discussed back in 2018, with an investment of EUR 19 million estimated for the project. A [geothermal exploration license was then granted to the city](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/city-of-oradea-in-romania-granted-exploration-license-for-geothermal-development/) in 2019, and [the tender for the design and execution of the project](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/tender-launch-for-geothermal-heat-project-in-oradea-romania/) was announced in 2021. The geothermal heating plant has an installed capacity of 18 MWth. The geothermal system operates based on two extraction and two reinjection wells, each drilled to a depth of approximately 2800 meters. The heat is distributed along the urban thermal network and is supplied through over 270 mini thermal points installed at the level of each block in the neighborhood. The inauguration ceremony was held at the new geothermal station led by Mayor Florin Birta and the Minister of Investments and European Projects, Marcel Bolos. The mayor pointed out that the local authorities aim to attract new European funds with the goal of increasing geothermal’s contribution to the heating supply to over 30% in the coming years. Minister Marcel Bolos also highlighted how the project demonstrates how European funds can be used effectively not only to enhance energy efficiency, but also to provide quality public services and real comfort for citizens. He lauded the efficient collaboration between the local authorities, the local operator [Termoficare Oradea SA](https://termoficareoradea.ro/), and the team from the Internationally Funded Projects Management Department. Mayor Florin Birta stated that the geothermal heating project is part of a more extensive strategy to modernize the heating system in Oradea. More investments are being made on network efficiency, the expansion of renewable sources, and the digitalization of public services. The municipality ultimately aims to attain an ambitious objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2030.",

    "title": "Groundlink Energy’s vision for sustainable geothermal growth in Vanuatu",
    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "7 Jul 2025",
    "content": "Groundlink Energy is building on industry experience, existing geologic data, and harmonious community relationships to pave the way for geothermal in Vanuatu. Geothermal is considered a game-changing opportunity for small islands, offering energy self-sufficiency and potential for economic growth. Such opportunities have already been explored in the Caribbean islands, and early efforts are underway in the small island groups of the Canary Islands, Greece, and Indonesia. Founded by four individuals with collective experience in geothermal development, drilling, environmental science, and finance, Australia-based Groundlink Energy aims to put together a portfolio of geothermal projects across the Pacific region. For the team, Vanuatu stood out because of the quality of the potential resource and the impact that the project could have on the local community and economy. _“We prioritized Vanuatu because we are confident in the potential resource,”_ explained Mr Horneman._“We are also confident that we can make a positive impact to the people and the economy of Vanuatu through the reduction of power costs, reduction of emissions, and reducing the dependence on diesel as the primary source of energy.”_ A signal of strong support from the government is also a major reason for the developer to pursue a project site in Vanuatu. When Prime Minister Jotham Napat came into office, he prioritized geothermal as part of the government’s 100-day plan. Ministers Rick Tchamako Mahe and Ralph Regenvanu, along with their respective departments, have also shown strong support for the initiative. With Vanuatu part of the joint bid between South Pacific Nations and Australia to jointly host COP31 in late 2026, the project has the potential to showcase regional climate leadership on a global stage. _“It’s a very fertile and supportive environment in which to develop a geothermal project.”_ added Mr Horneman. This is not the first time that geothermal development has been attempted specifically in the Takara site in North Efate. Another Australian company has shown interest in the project since 2009 but ultimately abandoned the project in 2016, citing various challenges including lack of electrical infrastructure connected to the project. Today, the project benefits from a new and supportive regulatory regime and developments in the domestic market. However, one of the most important changes is supporting infrastructure is now in place. The power transmission network now extends to the project site, and the power lines pass all the way across the granted permit area. This means that there is no longer a large investment needed to get the power to the market. _“We applaud all of the previous development efforts. They have completed some high-quality work, and their previous progress has helped to de-risk the project for us,”_ further added Mr Horneman. Based on past geoscientific work, the inferred geothermal resource has a capacity of 83 MW at P50 probability. A geothermal resource with temperatures of between 150 to 190 °C is expected at 500 meters depth. There is also a potential 300 °C resource at around 1500 meters depth. This will, of course, have to be validated by exploration drilling. _“There is far more generation capacity potential from this project than what there is current domestic demand, and that capacity could be in the hundreds and hundreds of MWh capacity,”_ said Mr Horneman. The company sees the potential excess power generation capacity as an opportunity for developing the project beyond the current domestic demand. This means that the project can help bring in new industries, such as data centres, to boost economic activity in Vanuatu. There are also nearby mining deposits that can be harnessed with mining operations powered by geothermal. Other industries requiring low-cost, low-emission electricity may also be attracted to the island. _“We have early stage offtake discussions underway, and an existing MOU in place with one particular outfit for power supply in the vicinity of 10 MW. Our plans to connect the project directly with fibre optic cables opens up almost limitless potential to host data centers that have strong demand for power and cooling.__We have further opportunities to explore such as carbon credits, processing local limestone for cement, green hydrogen production to displace diesel on nearby islands, and more.__“_ Mr Horneman added. The company has also committed to targeting a high percentage of local content for their project. This means providing direct employment to the locals, and engaging with as many domestic contractors and suppliers as possible. **The value of community engagement** A crucial element of implementing large-scale infrastructure projects in remote communities and small islands is securing the support of the local community. In the case of Efate, previous efforts on geothermal development have paved the way for community engagement at the Takara site. _“These previous efforts have raised the awareness in Vanuatu of the opportunity and potential of geothermal power,”_ explained Mr Horneman. Still, the company has been hard at work in communicating with the local communities, and providing a platform for them to voice their questions and concerns. In May 2025, Groundlink Energy [secured consent for the project](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/takara-vanuatu-geothermal-project-secures-community-consent/) from the local communities following a public consultation event. _“It was great to see the welcoming culture. We were pleased to share our plans and, at that meeting, the endorsement was provided to Groundlink to proceed with its exploration program. We have a really warm relationship with the local communities now, and we want to maintain those good relationships to keep them informed and supportive of our activities,”_ said Mr Horneman. _“For me, [community engagement] is a real priority, not only for being a good developer, but it’s a personal passion to create a strong ongoing connection with local communities and relationships built on trust.”_ Groundlink Energy is targeting an exploration drilling program, possibly with slim hole and core hole wells, next year. Before this, the team will revalidate the geological information with new surveys and update a geological model. Pre-submission for updated environmental approvals are currently underway. Discussions on power offtake and community engagement will continue to progress during this time. Currently, the priority for the company is raise capital and form joint ventures with other investors and players to accelerate the development program. The company is accepting expressions of interest from investors and other industry representatives to co-develop the project. Groundlink Energy is also looking into a number of prospective permit sites in neighboring countries, and will seek to secure those once enough momentum has built in Vanuatu.

    "content": "Vulcan Energy has announced the resumption of heating supply from the Landau geothermal heating plant in Germany to local utility EnergieSüdwest. Vulcan Energy has officially resumed district heating supply from the Landau geothermal heating plant to [EnergieSüdwest](https://energie-suedwest.de/) (ESW), the utility company of the city of Landau (Landau in der Pfalz) in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Initially, Vulcan will supply a maximum heat output of 2 megawatts (MW), depending on demand. This is equivalent to about 320 households. Landau’s mayor Dr. Dominik Geißler, mayor Lukas Hartmann, ESW board member Dr. Thomas Waßmuth, and Dr. Horst Kreuter, founder and general representative of Vulcan Energie Ressourcen GmbH, gave the official launch at an on-site meeting at the heating plant. The geothermal energy will be fed directly into the neighboring ESW heating plant, from where ESW will distribute it to the Landau South district heating network. The heat output from the geothermal source will be gradually expanded with the goal of making the Landau South district heating network almost entirely climate-neutral by the 2026-2027 heating season. Until now, the Landau South district heating network has been supplied mainly by gas-fired boilers and two combined heat and power plant operated by ESW. There are also plans to integrate the inner-city district heating network in the future. _“It’s fantastic that, thanks to[ the takeover and renovation of the geothermal power plant by Vulcan Energy](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/vulcan-to-streamline-geothermal-lithium-operations-in-germany-with-acquisition/), district heating from climate-friendly geothermal energy can finally be supplied to Landau households again. With the start of heat supply, we are taking an important step towards climate-neutral heat supply in Landau,”_ said Dr. Dominik Geißler, Mayor of Landau. _“Municipal heat planning is showing us the way forward – and deep geothermal energy is a key component. The fact that we can now supply the first households in the south of Landau with geothermal heat is a strong signal for our energy future.”_ _“The resumption of geothermal heat supply is also a significant milestone for EnergieSüdwest AG. We can now use our existing networks in Landau-Süd, as well as in the area of ??the former slaughterhouse, as originally planned, to supply our customers with geothermal district heating. In the medium term, we will be able to supply our existing networks 100 percent with this energy based on the power plant on Eutzinger Straße and even expand it,”_ added Dr. Thomas Waßmuth, CEO of EnergieSüdwest AG. The Landau geothermal power plant started operations in 2007 and was the first geothermal power plant in Rhineland-Palatinate. At the time, the power plant was owned by Pfalzwerke and Landau-based energy supplier Energie Sudwest. Problems in the Landau geothermal power plant manifested early on. Earthquakes were reported in the region, resulting in damage to houses. Eventually, the power plant had to throttle its output and no longer operated economically. By 2013, the Daldrup company took over the Landau power plant. By 2014, seismicity was also felt in the grounds of the power plant and damaged train tracks. The State Office for Geology and Mining then decided that the power plant had to be shut down temporarily as a precaution. Subsequent studies revealed that geothermal fluids from one of the two wells contaminated the groundwater in the area. The Daldrup company repaired the borehole damage before the State Office gave the go-ahead for final recommissioning. In 2019, there was another change in ownership as Daldrup[ company sold both the Landau and Taufkirchen power plants](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/daldrup-sohne-ag-concludes-complete-sale-of-taufkirchen-and-landau-geothermal-plants/) to IKAV Invest S.ar.l., Luxembourg. Vulcan has plans to further expand the geothermal infrastructure in the Landau region with five additional drilling sites and a total of up to 24 new wells planned to be drilled. Heat from these wells will then be fed into the district heating network. These plans are essential to the HEAT4LANDAU project, which is supported by [a funding commitment of up to EUR 100 million](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/vulcan-secures-federal-funding-for-geothermal-heating-project-in-landau-germany/) from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection. In addition to the heat transfer from the Landau geothermal heating plant to ESW, the thermal water is now also being piped to the neighboring [lithium extraction optimization plant (LEOP),](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/german-chancellor-visits-vulcans-landau-geothermal-and-lithium-extraction-facility/) where Vulcan extracts sustainable lithium for battery production. In this way, the company combines sustainable energy generation with the creation of regional added value. _“With the resumption of geothermal heat supply to ESW, Vulcan is setting another milestone for a sustainable heat supply for Landau. Vulcan’s integrated project demonstrates how the efficient use of renewable resources both strengthens the local heat supply and supports the European battery industry through the extraction of green lithium,”_ said Dr. Horst Kreuter, founder and general representative of Vulcan Energie Ressourcen GmbH.",

Preparatory work is at the final stages for exploration drilling at the Bonjol geothermal prospect located in the Pasaman Regency in West Sumatra, Indonesia. The developer, PT Medco Geothermal Sumatera (MGSu), is targeting the start of drilling by July 2025. The Bonjol geothermal prospect, with an estimated reserve size of 60 MW, was [assigned to PT Medco Energi](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/pt-medco-energi-started-initial-survey-for-bonjol-geothermal-prospect-west-sumatra/) in the second half of 2019. Due to the global pandemic, early exploration work at the site did not start until November 2023. The company started a field data collection campaign in 2023, followed by land acquisition and public engagement work in 2024. By the end of 2024, construction of the road to the drilling site had began. The construction of the well site was completed in March, including a processing According to Site Manager of PT Medco Geothermal Sumatera (MGSu) Sigit Widiatmoko, drilling will be done in two locations – Bonjol 1 in Kampung Tampang, and Bonjol 3 in Sungai Limau. The geothermal fluids are expected to have a temperature of about 150 °C, thus classifying the resource as medium-enthalpy. “Mas Sigit,” however, cautioned that the process will take time, and the power plant is expected to be operational by 2032. The Pasaman Regency expressed support for the project, welcoming the exploration activity as an opportunity to drive regional progress. According to Regent Sabar AS, Pasaman and West Sumatra have often been considered unattractive for investment. However, the presence of PT Medco Geothermal can erase this stigma, providing more regional income and creating jobs for the locals. On this topic, Sigit assured that the project would prioritize local workers while PT Medco Geothermal provides the specialized experts. Local government officials have called on the public to support the project, as it could also transform Bonjol into a tourist destination. If so, the transportation, agriculture, culinary, and creative economy sectors can also benefit from the development. The Head of the Investment and One-Stop Integrated Services Agency (DPMPTSP) of Pasaman Regency, Yusnimar, also expressed support for the other geothermal PSPE areas in the region, which includes the Cubadak (Dua Koto district) and Panti (Panti district) areas.

    "content": "Exceed Geo Energy has signed a 110-MW geothermal PPA with Presidio, Texas, providing stable power and commercial development opportunities for the region. The [Presidio Municipal Development District](https://presidiotx.us/?page_id=47) (PMDD) of Presidio County, Texas and [Exceed Geo Energy](https://exceedgeoenergy.com/) have signed a 110-MW geothermal power purchase agreement, in what is described as a transformative development opportunity for the region. The agreement was formalized during the inaugural “Presidio Vision 2035” student competition. The PPA is exceptionally beneficial for Presidio as it will deliver substantially greater electricity capacity than current local demand. This means that the future power infrastructure will be vital in attracting major industrial development to the strategic border location. The stability that geothermal offers is particularly significant for Presidio, which currently sits at the end of the line on the ERCOT grid and has experienced prolonged outages. The geothermal facility could also potentially serve as a blackstart resource capable of helping restore power to the broader Texas grid during major outages. _“This 110-megawatt commitment represents far more than meeting our current energy needs,”_ said John T. Kennedy, PMDD Executive Director. _“We’re creating the foundation for transformative economic growth: the kind of reliable, clean power that can support data centers, refrigerated logistics, expanded manufacturing, and value-added processing facilities that take advantage of our unique position in the North American trade corridor.”_ The agreement builds on[ last year’s resource assessment funded by PMDD](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/presidio-county-texas-shows-promise-for-geothermal-development/) and conducted by the University of Texas Bureau of Economic Geology, which provided crucial technical validation for the region’s geothermal potential. This comprehensive approach positions Presidio to become the first active geothermal project of this scale and type. Tim Tarver, CEO of Exceed Geo Energy, brings decades of experience in the energy industry. _“Growing up in a town even smaller than Presidio, I understand both the challenges and the incredible potential that exists in communities like this,”_ Tarver said. He went on to explain that the project represents more than energy development, focusing instead on building real economic opportunity that allows people to thrive in their home communities. Exceed Geo Energy is also working on [a 5-MW geothermal pilot project in Austin, Texas](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/austin-texas-to-pilot-5-mw-geothermal-power-project/) in partnership with local utility Austin Energy. The power purchase agreement will establish comprehensive terms for energy delivery, with commercial operations expected to begin by late 2026. The initial phase will bring 9.9 MW online, followed by expansion to the full 110-megawatt capacity. PMDD Board President Alonso Hernandez noted that the timing of the agreement framework during the student competition perfectly captured the community’s commitment to both honoring its future generations and building the infrastructure necessary for long-term prosperity. The geothermal development represents strategic planning that recognizes Presidio’s unique advantages: a critical position in international trade flows, proximity to major metropolitan markets, and access to world-class geothermal resources. The 110-MW capacity provides the kind of industrial-scale power generation that can transform regional economics by supporting data centers, manufacturing plants, and agricultural processing facilities simultaneously.",

The EUR 92 million project is being developed by Alexander Kottulinsky (Kotax Farm & Forestry) together with the Supernova Group. The first construction phase will cover 10 hectares and will be completed by early 2027, with further 8-hectare expansion targeted by 2028. The heat required for the project will come from a depth of 2900 meters, which will be executed by [RED Drilling.](https://www.red-drilling-services.at/) All associated projects have been approved by federal and state authorities Plans for a mega-greenhouse in the eastern Styria region were started around three years ago by the Mayor Wolfgang Dolesch of Neudau, who quickly convinced Mayor Gregor Löffler of Burgau to work together. The geothermal potential in the region is shared between the two municipalities, thus making cooperation between the two mayors critical. The project is expected to create up to 250 news jobs, provide a sustainable food source, and potentially allow for geothermal heat supply to the cities. _“This project shows what is possible when municipalities, businesses, and agriculture pull together. It is a_ great _opportunity for our region – both ecologically and economically,”_ said the two mayors in a joint statement. After an intensive search for an operator, Frutura was chosen via its parent company DOL Group Gmb. Frutura has extensive expertise in the operation of geothermal-heated greenhouses, primarily in their project in Bad Blumau which has been operating since 2016. In 2024, Frutura installed an ORC module from Orcan Energy [to convert excess heat in the Blumau facility to electricity](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/frutura-converts-excess-geothermal-heat-to-power-with-orcan-energy-technology/).",

Construction of the surface facility for a geothermal heating project in Monster in the province of South Holland in the Netherlands is in full swing. If everything goes according to plan, the testing of the system will start at the end of 2025 and 23 greenhouse horticulture businesses will soon be supplied with geothermal heating. The [Aardwarmte Polanen](https://www.aardwarmtepolanen.nl/) project, first launched in 2022, envisions a geothermal heating network supplying several horticulture facilities in the village of Monster. The heat will come from two geothermal wells each drilled to a depth of 2300 meters back in 2023. Testing of the doublet indicated that water at 85 °C can be extracted from the resource at a sufficient flowrate to support the project. Installation and construction of the surface equipment for the Aardwarmte Polanen project will proceed for the next several months. After the summer, work will start on the building that will house the filters, pumps, and heat exchangers. As part of Warmtesysteem Westland, [a larger regional heat network](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/successful-rollout-of-westland-geothermal-heat-system-netherlands/), the Aardwarmte Polanen project will be part of a system that allows for different heat clusters to trade heat from geothermal sources. This makes it possible to temporarily take more or less heat, such as during a crop change. In this way, heat supply and heat demand can be coordinated 24/7.",

    "content": "After 25 years of successful operations, geothermal heating in Unterschleißheim, Germany is set to expand based on growing demand and steady community support. On the 25th year of operations of the geothermal heating plant in Unterschleißheim, Germany, the city is considering the drilling of a second production well to further expand the coverage of the geothermal heating service. Operating since 2003, the geothermal heating plant of [Geothermie Unterschleißheim AG](https://www.unterschleissheim.de/gtu-geothermie-unterschleissheim-ag.html) (GTU) made Unterschleißheim the first municipality in the Munich district to use geothermal water for heating. The company [achieved profitability in 2014](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/german-heating-project-profitable-14-years-ahead-of-plans/), well ahead of forecasts set at 2028. In the past decades, the geothermal heating system proved to be a reliable and climate-friendly pillar of energy supply in the city. The deep geothermal plant in Unterschleißheim derives its heat energy from thermal waters at a depth of 1961 meters. The temperature of the thermal water is at around 80°C. The municipal company operates a more than 22-kilometer long district heating network which currently supplies more than 4000 apartments, 351 buildings, and several businesses. This accounts for about 70% of the city’s heat supply. To date, the city has invested EUR 36.5 million on the geothermal heating system. Expansion plans are now underway, driven by a growing demand for geothermal heating. Two years ago, more than 1000 households expressed interest in being connected to the network. This means that a further EUR 30 million will be invested in expanding the network by 2028, about 40% of which will come from federal funding. There are also plans to deploy a large-scale heat pump by 2027, as well as to drilling a second production well. _“Based on our experience, we assume that we will have the additional 20 MW under contract in five to seven years,”_ said Thomas Stockerl, Chairman of GTU. Community support for geothermal is strong, despite the fact that the price per kW for geothermal is slightly higher than that of gas. Stockerl explains that homeowners still get savings when factoring in the costs of maintenance and system renewable. The Chairman is also convinced that geothermal energy will become more affordable in the medium to long term as gas and oil prices become more expensive. _“By 2045, GTU should be completely greenhouse gas neutral – with hydrogen or biogas as backup,”_ concluded Mayor Christoph Böck._“We want to supply 50 percent of the buildings, including commercial ones.”_",

    "content": "A new ÍSOR report highlights Iceland’s unique geothermal conditions, presented this week in connection with a government meeting on renewable energy. Iceland GeoSurvey (ÍSOR) has published an [updated assessment of the country’s geothermal resources](https://www.stjornarradid.is/library/02-Rit--skyrslur-og-skrar/URN/Jar%c3%b0varmamat%20-%20sk%c3%bdrsla%20%c3%8dsor%2023092025.pdf), reaffirming Iceland’s exceptional conditions for geothermal utilization. The updated study provides new data and analysis on resource potential across the country, offering valuable input for both policy and project development. According to ÍSOR, Iceland’s geothermal characteristics remain globally unique, with extensive opportunities for electricity generation, heating, and industrial use. The report was presented this week in connection with a government meeting focused on renewable energy and the role of geothermal in Iceland’s future energy mix. Officials emphasized that the updated resource mapping will serve as a foundation for strategic planning and sustainable development. “These results highlight once again how geothermal energy is not just part of Iceland’s past, but a key pillar for its future,” ÍSOR noted in the release. **Summary of the 2025 Iceland Geothermal Assessment** **Scope:** First comprehensive update since 1985, incorporating extensive new data on geothermal heat flow, borehole productivity, and regional heat distribution. **Findings:** * Iceland’s geothermal endowment is larger and more precisely mapped than before, with significant high- and low-temperature fields identified across 14 regions. * The natural heat flow within volcanic zones is far higher than in older crustal areas, with measured heat flow values up to 500 mW/m². * The combined exploitable thermal energy of geothermal systems is estimated at 4,100 kg/s of mass flow and 635 MWth of thermal power from known fields. * High-temperature fields (e.g. Hengill, Krafla, Reykjanes) could provide between 1,860-6,520 MWe over a 50-year utilization horizon. **Advances since 1985:** * Much improved mapping of temperature gradients and heat flow across the country. * Better understanding of sustainable yield, with frameworks for long-term utilization. * Integration of data on natural hot springs, low-temperature fields, and district heating operations. **Policy relevance:** The report underlines geothermal as Iceland’s strategic advantage for power, heating, and industrial use, providing a strong base for future energy planning and climate policy. With increasing international attention on energy security and decarbonization, the updated assessment underlines Iceland’s leadership in geothermal research and application.

    "content": "The island of Pantelleria may become a leader in geothermal development in Sicily, highlighting new opportunities for sustainable energy and local growth. The Italian island of Pantelleria is emerging as a key location for the development of geothermal energy in Sicily, with experts pointing to its unique geological conditions as ideal for low-impact and sustainable energy production. Located between Sicily and Tunisia, the island is of volcanic origin and has long been recognized for its geothermal activity. A recent initiative led by the [University of Catania](https://www.dfa.unict.it/), in collaboration with the Italian National Research Council (CNR) and the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV), is exploring the possibility of harnessing this potential to support local decarbonization and energy independence. _“Pantelleria offers a rare opportunity to develop geothermal energy with minimal environmental impact, and in a way that benefits both the island and the broader Sicilian region,”_ said Prof. Flavio Cannata, geophysicist at the University of Catania. With support from the [Italian Ministry of Environment and Energy Security](https://www.mase.gov.it/) (MASE) and regional authorities, the project aims to create a model of small-scale geothermal energy production that can be replicated in other parts of Sicily and beyond. Pantelleria’s geothermal system is considered ideal for a “binary cycle” plant, which does not release emissions into the atmosphere and has a low surface footprint—making it especially suitable for areas with natural and cultural value. The ongoing research includes geophysical surveys, well monitoring, and environmental assessments to better understand the island’s geothermal reservoir. The results are promising and point toward a sustainable, long-term resource capable of supplying clean, baseload energy to the local grid. **Why Pantelleria matters for geothermal in Italy** Italy has long been a leader in geothermal energy, with the Larderello region in Tuscany being the world’s first site of geothermal electricity production. However, there is now growing interest in expanding geothermal development across southern Italy and the islands, where volcanic activity presents significant untapped potential. Pantelleria may become the “southern front” of Italy’s geothermal renaissance—contributing to decarbonization goals, reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels, and offering a resilient solution to energy supply in island environments. **For the geothermal sector** Pantelleria is a prime example of how academic institutions, public agencies, and local communities can collaborate to unlock geothermal potential in a responsible and innovative way. The island’s initiative sets a precedent for sustainable energy development in sensitive regions, opening doors for future investments and public-private partnerships across the Mediterranean. We previously reported on efforts to explore the [geothermal potential of Sicily](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/?s=Sicily).",

The [Geological Survey of North Rhine-Westphalia](https://www.gd.nrw.de/gd_wir.htm) (Geologischer Dienst NRW / GD NRW) has announced a tender for drilling services for a geothermal research borehole to be drilled in the Dellbrück district in eastern Cologne, Germany. The deadline for applications for this tender will be on 16 September 2025. The objective of the borehole is to core the entire sequence of the Devonian Massenkalk down to the underlying silicilastic Middle Devonian. Based on data by GD NRW, this sequence is expected at a depth of 700 meters. Drilling is thus planned to a maximum depth of 1000 meters. The well can be terminated prematurely if the base of the Massenkalk can be intercepted at shallower depths. According to the tender documents, the construction of the drilling site is scheduled for Q4 of 2025, while the actually drilling operations are to begin by 1Q 2026. Geothermal research drilling in Cologne, [as already announced earlier this year](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/cologne-sets-sights-on-deep-geothermal-potential/), is part of the [NRW Geothermal Master Plan](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/north-rhine-westphalia-germany-publishes-geothermal-energy-master-plan/).

By the 11th of August 2025, seismic surveys will begin to create a detailed map of the subsurface in the city of Lódz in Poland. This will be in aid of characterizing the potential geothermal resource in the area which is being developed for a district heating project. Vibro-trucks will be traveling along designated routes to send vibrations into the earth for 20 seconds. Vibrations will then be picked up by geophones placed in advance along the routes. Operations will be done mainly in the evening and night hours. The survey will take approximately 4 weeks and cover approximately 186 kilometers. Research on the potential of geothermal energy in Lódz is being done by a cooperation between Danish geothermal developer [Innargi](https://innargi.com/) with local company [Veolia Energia Lódz.](https://www.energiadlalodzi.pl/) The letter of intent to launch a joint geothermal exploration campaign [was signed between the two parties in late 2024](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/innargi-and-veolia-group-partner-for-geothermal-heating-in-lodz-poland/). The geothermal project is part of Veolia’s long-term strategy to decarbonize the Lódz district heating system, including through the development of renewable energy sources. Veolia and Innargi estimate that geothermal energy could provide up to 200 MW of installed capacity, covering about 15% of the current thermal capacity of the Lódz district heating system. However, such development will depend on several factors, including the need to meet legal and procedural requirements for this type of investment.",

    "content": "A new report by Project InnerSpace and Future Ventures shows that geothermal can power data centers at costs competitive to combined-cycle natural gas plants. A new report published by [Project InnerSpace](https://www.projectinnerspace.org/) and [Future Ventures](https://future.ventures/) presents that geothermal can provide power for data centers at a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) competitive with a combined-cycle natural gas based on a theoretical 1-GWe geothermal energy project in the Western United States. The analysis presents a pathway to reducing the LCOE of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) to approximately USD 50/MWh within the next 10 to 15 years through investment, policy support, technology transfer from oil and gas, and ongoing advancements in technology, [Click here to access the full report,**“From Core to Code: Powering the AI Revolution with Geothermal Energy.”**](https://projectinnerspace.org/resources/Powering-the-AI-Revolution.pdf) The report complements[ a previous paper published by the Rhodium Group](https://rhg.com/research/geothermal-data-center-electricity-demand/) which states that geothermal[ can economically provide up to 64% of the US data center energy needs](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/could-geothermal-meet-rising-data-center-electricity-demand/). At $50/MWh, a theoretical 1-GW geothermal energy project can undercut nearly all combined-cycle natural gas plants. However, the estimate is based on the application of investment tax credits (ITCs). Without such benefit, the LCOE of the geothermal project will increase to $119/MWh. This is still significantly better than Lazard’s current estimates for nuclear power, which is at $140/MWh. The report acknowledges that the continuance of ITCs remains uncertain based on potential policy changes in the United States. The authors argue that if the government chose to invest $10 billion (half of annual US oil and gas subsidies), then the subsequent unsubsidized LCOE for EGS would fall below the media of combine-cycle natural gas within 10 years. Thus, ensuring that tax credits remain intact for geothermal is critical in ensuring the growth of next-generation geothermal.",

    "content": "With the aspiration to become the largest geothermal power producer in the world, the Indonesian Government is taking measures to facilitate geothermal growth. The Government of Indonesia is making progress towards creating a policy environment that promotes the growth of the country’s installed geothermal power capacity. This was a key part of the message of Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) Bahlil Lahadalia at the opening of the [Indonesia International Geothermal Convention and Exhibition](https://iigce.com/) (IIGCE) held in Jakarta on 17-19 September 2025. _“We know that geothermal energy is a renewable energy source, and Indonesia has quite large reserves, the largest in the world. And of this, we can only manage approximately 10 percent. This means there is still 90% of this potential,”_ said the Minister. Indonesia currently has an installed geothermal power generation capacity of 2,744 MWe, placing [it securely at second rank worldwide](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/thinkgeoenergys-top-10-geothermal-countries-2024-power/). However, this is only about 10% of the geothermal potential of the country, which is estimated to be about 23,742 MWe. Given this large untapped potential, Bahlil called for an immediate auction of Geothermal Working Areas (WKP). Starting this year, WKP auctions will be conducted through the [Geothermal Energy Information System (GENESIS) platform,](https://genesis.ebtke.esdm.go.id/gdr/) a digital platform for geothermal management. This is part of the efforts of the ESDM to simplify permitting and regulations with the aim of [reducing the permit processing time from 18 months to only 5 days](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/indonesia-aims-to-shorten-geothermal-permit-process-to-just-five-days/). _“One thing investors dislike is complicated regulations. The more complicated the regulations, the less they appeal to investors. Therefore, our program over the past year has been to cut various regulatory hurdles that hinder the acceleration of the geothermal sector. We’ve cut them all,”_ commented Bahlil. The Indonesian Government has also committed to the building of 48,000 circuit kilometers of transmission network to help promote the new and renewable energy. This is part of the 2025-2034 Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL). Several agreements were also signed at the IIGCE 2025 covering commercial cooperation between business entities, capacity building, technology development, and financing commitments with a capacity of 265 MW and a total investment of USD 1.5 billion (IDR 25 trillion).",

    "content": "After an exploration drilling campaign, further seismic surveys are being considered for geothermal research in the Utrecht province in the Netherlands. Various exploratory drilling efforts have already been undertaken in and around the Amersfoort region in the province of Utrecth in the Netherlands to characterize its subsurface and potential geothermal resources. By the end of the year, the national [SCAN](https://scanaardwarmte.nl/) program will decide if further seismic surveys will be necessary to advance the research. This follows on exploratory drilling previously done in [De Bilt](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-research-drilling-begins-in-de-bilt-netherlands/), Ede, and [Ouder-Amstel](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/permit-granted-for-geothermal-exploratory-drilling-in-amsterdam-netherlands/), as well as previous seismic surveys. To actually extract geothermal energy, more information about the deep subsurface is needed. This includes, among other things, the depth of the existing strata and the presence of faults. The target area of the seismic survey is the region northeast of the province of Utrecht, as shown below. The first step of this supplementary research is to further map the subsurface and align it with the above-ground heat demand. Some of the necessary data for this is already available. Currently, studies are still ongoing into both the subsurface suitability and the heat demand. The research results are expected by the end of 2025. It will then be determined whether the seismic survey will take place, and if so, where exactly. SCAN aims to complete the accompanying plan by the end of 2025. If the seismic survey will push through, it will likely happen in 2026. The exact timing cannot be indicated yet, as the availability of the contractor and the breeding season of animals in the region need to be considered. f seismic surveying proves feasible, it will be further coordinated with municipalities and water boards. Local residents will receive additional information prior to the survey.",

Subsequently, all the formal steps required for the company’s formation were initiated, which were recently completed with the entry in the commercial register. SWM currently holds a 60% stake in the company, while Germering holds a 25% stake and Puchheim a 15% stake. Plans for a joint company were [already indicated earlier this year](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/german-cities-puchheim-and-germering-to-collaborate-on-geothermal-heating/). As previously pointed out, both the cities of Germering and Puchheim have attempted to develop geothermal projects in the past but were met with either financial or social acceptance of hurdles. In the context of the new joint company, SWM provides 20 years of experience in operating six geothermal plants in the wider Munich area. A further advantage is that the costs of constructing and operating the plant can be shared. _“As project partners, we all have the same interest: securing renewable heat for our cities,”_ explains Norbert Seidl, Mayor of Puchheim. _“Munich municipal utility company will contribute its extensive geothermal experience from the past 20 years. With its projects in the Munich area, it has proven that geothermal energy is an essential building block for a secure and stable heat supply. Thanks to this partnership, we look forward to the project with confidence.”_ There is plenty of work to be done, with the three parties working together on applying for funding, commissioning a feasibility and study, and identifying the most suitable site for drilling. An initial information event for all residents is planned for the fall. Based on the current schedule, the geothermal plant will not be commissioned until 2033 at the earliest.",

    "content": "The Steingerði air purification plant has been officially opened, reducing CO2 and H2S emissions from the Hellisheidi geothermal power plant in Iceland. The Hellisheidi geothermal power plant of [ON Power](https://www.on.is/) in Iceland is now operating at a nearly carbon-neutral manner with the inauguration of the Steingerði air purification plant, which captures almost all carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide emissions. The design and construction of Steingerður is part of the Silfurberg project, an innovation project funded by the European Union’s Innovation Fund. The Silfurberg project, led by [Carbfix](https://www.carbfix.com/) and [Orka náttúrunnar](https://www.on.is/) (a subsidiary of Orkuveitarn), aims to demonstrate the capture and permanent storage of carbon dioxide in rock on a larger scale than previously possible. The project is receiving €3.87 million from the[ EU Innovation Fund](https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/eu-funding-climate-action/innovation-fund_en), which will enable Carbfix to scale up its technology. With Steingerður, it will be able to capture around 30,000 tonnes of CO2 annually, which will then be safely and permanently converted into rock using [the Carbfix technology.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/video-introduction-to-carbfix-capturing-and-storing-co2-to-stone/) The air purification plant was officially inaugurated in the presence of Jóhann Páll Jóhannsson, Minister of the Environment, Energy and Climate. The Minister said on the occasion that the Silfurberg project is a great example of what can be achieved when science, industry and government work together. _“This is a big day for climate technology in Iceland. Carbon capture and sequestration is among the urgent actions that need to be taken to combat climate change. This has been repeatedly recognized by the international scientific community, including the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Important steps have been taken by Icelandic entrepreneurs in this regard and it is imperative that the activities rest on clear rules for the future,”_ said Jóhann Páll. The Silfurberg project alone is expected to deliver 10% of Iceland’s 2030 climate commitments within the energy and industrial sectors not covered by the EU Emissions Trading System. The project fits well with Iceland’s target of a 55% reduction in emissions by 2030 and highlights the growing role of geothermal energy in the global energy mix. _“ON’s goal has always been to produce hot water and electricity responsibly. Steingerður is a major milestone on that journey and we are proud that Hellisheidi Power Plant will become one of the first geothermal power plants in the world to become nearly carbon neutral,”_ said Árni Hrannar Haraldsson, Managing Director of Orka náttúrunn. _“Silfurberg marks an important step in the increased use of Carbfix’s proven technology in connection with domestic energy production, while laying the foundation for more projects based on a common European regulatory framework. The opening of Silfurberg follows the opening of other projects in the field of carbon management in our neighboring countries in recent days and is a testament to the progressiveness of Icelandic and European industry towards real success on a broad basis,”_ added Edda Sif Pind Aradóttir, CEO of Carbfix. **[RELATED: Ngawha becomes New Zealand’s first zero-carbon geothermal power station](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/ngawha-becomes-new-zealands-first-zero-carbon-geothermal-power-station/)**",

    "content": "The Government of Grenada has announced plans to drill two geothermal exploration wells by 2026 with the long-term goal of developing a 15-MW power plant. The Government of Grenada is resolute in moving forward with a planned geothermal energy development project, with exploration drilling now planned for 2026. The goal would be to drill two exploratory wells with on at Plaisance, St. John and another at Tricolar, St. Patrick. The selection of drilling sites was based on the [comprehensive surface-based geoscientific investigations done in 2015](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/grenada-moving-ahead-with-exploration-work-on-geothermal-project/). Exploration drilling will provide further information to confirm the commercial viability of the inferred geothermal resource. If the findings confirm a viable geothermal resource, the most promising site will be selected for further development. Anticipated activities include: * Engaging a qualified geothermal developer * Drilling production and reinjection wells * Designing and constructing the steam field and geothermal power plant * Developing the transmission infrastructure necessary to integrate this renewable energy into the national grid. The long-term goal for this initiative is to develop a 15-MW geothermal power facility that will supply up to 44% of Grenada’s current electricity needs, thus effectively powering all households. This will offset more than 5.5 million gallons of diesel imports annually, enhancing national energy security and avoiding more than 25 million tonnes of CO2 emissions over 25 years.",

    "content": "Organized by SARA, a Geothermal Short Course in Budapest contributed to geothermal education while highlighting Hungary's geothermal expertise and history. I had the great opportunity to attend the **Geothermal Short Course 2025** , held in Budapest, Hungary from **23 to 27 June 2025**. The program successfully brought together budding young students, professionals, MSc and PhD students, and experienced professionals looking to deepen their involvement in the geothermal field. Organised by the **[Supervisory Authority for Regulatory Affairs](https://sztfh.hu/?lang=en) (SARA)**, the short course, titled **“Exploration and Utilisation of Geothermal Resources in Sedimentary Basins,”** Hungary has a long-standing history of geothermal direct use in sedimentary basins and is home to experts with deep knowledge and wide-ranging expertise. With this course, SARA sought to share that national expertise, complemented by contributions from invited international specialists. Dr. László Nagy, President of SARA, opened the event by welcoming 29 participants from across four continents, highlighting the importance of geothermal energy in the global energy transition. He emphasized that knowledge sharing is a key driver in accelerating the deployment of geothermal solutions worldwide. Despite its compact format, the short course offered a comprehensive overview of subjects critical to the full lifecycle of geothermal development, blending theory, case studies, and practical application. Topics included: A full day was also dedicated to field activities, starting with a live demonstration of well-logging equipment and procedures by [Geo-Log Environmental & Geophysical Ltd.](https://geo-log.hu/) This was followed by visits to the [geothermal heating system at the MTK Sports Park facility](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-sports-park-with-geothermal-heating-completed-in-budapest-hungary/) and the[ Széchenyi Thermal Spa & Zoo complex](https://www.szechenyibath.hu/), both located in Budapest. The event also served as an excellent platform for networking and knowledge exchange. Participants came from diverse professional backgrounds—including undergraduate students, academic researchers, oil and gas professionals, and private sector representatives within the geothermal industry. Despite their varied roles, everyone shared a common goal: to expand their understanding of geothermal energy and contribute their own experience and expertise to the dialogue. Among the highlights were guest presentations from Sanjeev Kumar, Policy Director of the [European Geothermal Energy Council](https://www.egec.org/) (EGEC), and Miklós Antics, EGEC President. They discussed the history of geothermal energy in Europe and provided valuable insights into policy frameworks, market development, and strategies to support the growth of sustainable geothermal deployment across the region. In my correspondence with Ábel Markó, Energy Specialist at SARA and one of the lead coordinators of the event, he shared their satisfaction with how the short course turned out: _“We were especially glad to see the active discussion among the participants during the workshop session organised on the closing day. The active participation, along with the diverse professional backgrounds and career stages of the 29 participants, led to valuable exchange of ideas and meaningful dialogues.”_ When asked whether the course will be offered again, he added: _“Yes, we plan to continue in the coming years, building on the experience gained this year and on the network we’ve established. Further plans include organising similar educational programs with specific focus and content.”_ Hungary’s first-ever geothermal short-course was a resounding success, supported and expertly coordinated by its lead by SARA. The program featured engaging lectures, thought-provoking discussions, and inspired active participation from all attendees. We extend our best wishes to Hungary in its ongoing efforts to grow its geothermal industry and strengthen its vibrant geothermal community.

Drilling of a geothermal doublet has officially started at the site of the [Joint Municipal Company for Waste Management](https://www.gfa-online.com/) (Gemeinsames Unternehmen für Abfallwirtschaft / GfA) in Geiselbullach in the municipality of Olching in Bavaria, Germany. The project by [Amperland Thermalwärme GmbH](https://www.amperland-thermalwaerme.de/) (ATW) envisions a geothermal heating facility that will serve the existing district heating network, which is currently supplied by a waste incineration facility. Two geothermal wells will be drilled from a single pad to a depth of approximately 1725 meters, into an Upper Jurassic aquifer hosting thermal waters are approximately 73 °C. Drilling is expected to be completed by December 2025. German drilling company [Daldrup & Söhne Aktiengesellschaft](https://daldrup.eu/) (Daldrup & Söhne) had been [awarded the contract for the drilling work](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/daldrup-sohne-signs-contract-for-geothermal-drilling-in-geiselbullach-germany/). The application for a mining permit for the geothermal heating project [was made back in May 2023.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/waste-to-energy-plant-in-olching-germany-seeks-to-pivot-to-geothermal/) Federal funding for the project was confirmed in November 2024, and the approval for the project was granted in June 2025. If drilling is successful, a central heating plant will be built at the site. This will include a heat exchanger which will serve as the interface between the deep thermal fluids and the circulating fluids of the district heating network. According to the GfA, the drilling site close to the waste incineration plant offers optimal conditions for drilling of the wells, as well as the construction and operations of the heating plant. The site is has 24/7 monitoring and has safety measures in place, including comprehensive groundwater monitoring. The geothermal project in Geiselbullach is supported by the Federal Funding for Efficient Heat Networks” (BEW) program of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection (BMWK), which provides a 40% investment subsidy for generation facilities and infrastructure.",

    "content": "The Ashford Borough Council is working with Kensa to reduce energy bills in Kent, UK through the implementation of geothermal heat pump systems. A geothermal heating project using heat pump technology will soon deliver reduced energy bills to a number of households in the Ashford Borough in Kent in southeastern England. For this project, the [Ashford Borough Council](https://www.ashford.gov.uk/) is working with UK ground source heat pump (GSHP) specialist [Kensa](https://kensa.co.uk/). As part of the initiative, multiple boreholes will be drilled to 100 meters depth and fitted with heat gathering systems. Energy harnessed from the boreholes will then be fed to heat pumps, which allows for the boosting of low-grade heat to higher temperatures, making the energy appropriate for low-cost space heating and hot water to residential units. The scheme will be implemented in 74 homes in the villages of Appledore and Charing, thus replacing a mix of oil-fired, electric, and gas heating systems. The response from the community has been very positive. _“I think this is a great idea. Our electric storage heaters are expensive to run and I’m looking forward to saving the pennies and have a warmer, more comfortable home,”_ said Craig Godden, a resident of the Heathside area in Appledore. _“Storage heaters are costing me a fortune so this is a very good idea. My daughter is jealous that I’m getting ground source heat pumps fitted.”_ said Peter Simpson, another resident. _“We’re excited to collaborate with Ashford on this brilliant project, helping to decarbonise their properties while providing residents with a reliable, highly efficient low-carbon heating solution,”_ added Stuart Gadsden, Commercial Director at Kensa. _“Our ground source heat pumps are among the most energy-efficient and sustainable heating options available and, depending on the system they replace, residents could benefit from significantly lower energy bills and a heavily reduced carbon footprint. We have a proven track record of installing our British-made heat pumps in thousands of social homes and are looking forward to extending these benefits to even more residents through this initiative with Ashford.”_ The scheme is part of a bigger drive by the Ashford Borough Council to retrofit around 700 homes with energy-saving measures using Government funding of £5.1m. The money – from the Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund Wave 2 – is bolstered by a £6.2m contribution from the council. Working with a delivery partner, improvements already delivered over the past 18 months includes cavity wall insulation, external wall insulation, new windows and doors, under floor insulation, air source heat pumps and solar panels. Cllr Noel Ovenden, Council Leader and Portfolio Holder for Housing, said: _“These measures will cut carbon emissions, help reduce energy demand and give residents more money in their pockets from cheaper energy bills. We’re working closely with our tenants to ensure they understand how the GSHP systems work and to recognise the tremendous benefits they will enjoy because of these exciting improvements._ Kensa has published a short video overview of the project, which you can watch below: ?",

The bill also defines a “geothermal resource” as the natural heat of the earth in excess of 250 °F (121 °C) including all minerals in solutions obtained from naturally heated fluids, excluding oil and other hydrocarbons. _“New Mexico has nearly 2,000 orphaned wells across our state, sitting unused and posing pollution risks to our people and environment,_ ” said Rep. Romero. _“House Bill 361 will not just support the cleanup and methane monitoring of these wells, but repurpose unused and unusable assets for clean energy battery storage and geothermal production — a win-win for all.”_ The repurposing of oil and gas wells for geothermal use was also one of the provisions under[ North Dakota’s Senate Bill 2360](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/north-dakota-passes-bill-to-conduct-a-feasibility-study-on-the-geothermal-development/), which was also just signed by the Governor recently.",

Rehabilitation work on the Olkaria I geothermal power plant in Kenya is now at 70% completion, and commissioning of the first turbine is expected by June 2026. This update was provided by [KenGen](https://kengen.co.ke/index.php?view=article&id=1) Managing Director and CEO, Eng. Peter Njenga at the sidelines of the Africa Energy Forum, held in Cape Town, South Africa. The Olkaria I geothermal power station, the oldest in Kenya, [was shut down in 2023](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/works-starts-on-olkaria-i-geothermal-power-station-rehabilitation-kenya/) to give way to rehabilitation work. In 2024,[ Toshiba ESS was awarded the contract to supply steam turbines and generators](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/kengen-taps-toshiba-for-olkaria-geothermal-power-plant-uprating/) to Units 1 to 3, increasing the old capacity of 45 MW to 63 MW after rehabilitation. According to the latest update by Njenga, the two steam turbines and generators for Units 2 and 3 have now been delivered to the projec site. The final set, destined for Unit 1, has been dispatched and is currently in transit. KenGen expects all the critical equipment to arrive by the end of this month. Other major power plant components have already arrived and several have been installed. _“We have a large team of 928 people including elite project engineers, technicians, foremen, artisans, and general workers, led by the General Manager, Business Development & Strategy, Elizabeth Njenga and the Design and Construction Manager, Eng.

Energy company [Sorgenia](https://www.sorgenia.it/) has announced that it will no longer continue with plans to develop two geothermal power projects in the Tuscany region of Italy. The company cited economic reasons for withdrawing from the projects, exacerbated by a long authorization process and the company’s own imminent shareholder reorganization. In 2022, the Italian government gave the green light to Sorgenia to proceed with two proposed geothermal projects – a [10-MW binary geothermal power plant in Val di Paglia](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/italy-pm-gives-go-ahead-for-10-mw-binary-geothermal-power-plant-in-tuscany/), and a [5-MW binary geothermal power plant in Poggio Montone](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/green-light-given-to-poggio-montone-geothermal-project-italy/). The proposed projects of Sorgenia were important for two reasons – these would have been the first geothermal power plants in Italy not operated by Enel Green Power, and would have been the first deployment of commercial-scale binary power plant technology in Italy. Sorgenia further stated that _“the evolution of the reference framework has made the implementation of the projects increasingly less sustainable from an economic point of view.”_ The company statement also alludes to efforts to involve other operators to finance the construction of the power plants. The ownership of Sorgenia is expected to change soon, with the American fund Sixth Street eyeing a 40% stake from the company, which is currently controlled by the F2i group. The company says that it maintains that geothermal has a positive value in terms of its energy, environmental, and socio-economic benefits. However, Sorgenia will now refocus is efforts on the development of other renewable energy facilities.",

The [General Directorate of Mineral Research and Exploration](https://www.mta.gov.tr/) (MTA), a Turkish state institution, is launching a new geothermal drilling project in the village of Çamalak, located in the Boztepe district of the city of Kirsehir. Known for its thermal water resources, the region may offer new opportunities for renewable energy and greenhouse investments through this initiative. The project, with an estimated budget of approximately 10 million TL (approx. USD 250,000), will involve the drilling of an exploration well “KBC-1” within license area AR:2023/3. The well is planned to reach a depth of 2,750 meters and will provide important information on the region’s geothermal potential. Core samples will be collected from the well, and geophysical measurements and well logging will be conducted to determine the underground structure and presence of hot water. After the completion of the work, the well will be temporarily sealed, and the site will be rehabilitated to restore its natural state. If an economically viable resource is discovered, MTA’s license will be transferred to the private sector through a public tender process, in accordance with the relevant legal framework. In addition to the [Kirsehir Regional Energy Project](https://www.jeotermalhaberler.com/kirsehirde-jeotermal-enerji-ile-bolgesel-isitma-ve-konaklama-sektorune-destek/) reported in recent months, geothermal exploration, health tourism, and [greenhouse cultivation projects](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/university-taking-lead-on-development-of-geothermal-greenhouse-in-kirsehir-turkey/) underway in the [Mucur district of Kirsehir](https://www.jeotermalhaberler.com/kirsehir-ve-nevsehirde-jeotermal-arama-ve-saglik-turizmi-projesi/) and the Kozakli district of Nevsehir are also drawing attention.

    "date": "27 Aug 2025",
    "content": "A number of universities in the UK have enhanced their seismology research capabilities with the acquisition of around 2000 seismic nodes from STRYDE. This investment, led by the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) and backed by six other leading institutions, will make nodal seismic imaging technology widely accessible to the UK science community for the first time. The new equipment will form a national technology pool, hosted by the University of Cambridge, and will be made available to researchers from the University of Newcastle, the University of East Anglia, the University of Edinburgh, the University of Oxford, Birkbeck, and the NERC British Antarctic Survey. This initiative represents a major advance in the capabilities of UK-based passive seismology, opening the door to state-of-the-art large-N seismic surveys across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Over the past decade, compact, cable-free and cost-effective seismic recording technology has revolutionised global seismology by enabling the deployment of [thousands of sensors in high-density configuration](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/the-importance-of-high-resolution-seismic-in-geothermal-exploration/)s. These “large-N” arrays deliver unparalleled resolution of the Earth’s seismic wavefield, yet until now, this technology has been largely inaccessible to UK researchers due to the high costs of sporadic leasing of equipment. The establishment of this node pool, equipped with STRYDE’s Mini Seismic Systems, directly addresses this gap, offering researchers an affordable solution for high-density seismic acquisition. The systems will support a broad spectrum of research aligned with the UK’s [Natural Environment Research Council](https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/) (NERC) remit, including: * Geothermal energy and carbon capture and storage monitoring * Earthquake and volcano hazard assessment * Landslide and environmental seismology * Ice sheet monitoring in climate change research * Urban seismic studies * Geotechnical and civil engineering _“This equipment dramatically increases the speed and agility with which we can deploy large-N seismic arrays, while delivering a step-change in data resolution and image quality. It will open the door to ambitious, high-impact research projects that were previously logistically or financially unfeasible and will help position the UK at the forefront of innovation in seismic imaging,”_ said Nick Rawlinson, Professor of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge, Department of Earth Sciences. _“This project is a significant milestone for the UK geophysics community,”_ said Nick Tranter, Head of Business Development, New Energy and Services at STRYDE._“STRYDE was founded with a clear mission: to make high-density seismic imaging accessible and affordable for all. We’re proud that our technology is now enabling scientists across the UK to accelerate seismic research with the potential to drive meaningful global impact.”_ STRYDE’s nodal systems are highly scalable and easy to deploy, even in remote or challenging environments, thus offering a sustainable alternative to traditional broadband systems. With a lifespan exceeding 10 years, minimal environmental impact, and simple field operation, STRYDE nodes enable large-scale experimentation without the resource burden. This national pool ensures that UK seismology remains at the forefront of global research while making world-class geophysical tools accessible to all. With STRYDE’s Mini Seismic Systems, even researchers with limited budgets or field deployment experience can now undertake ambitious seismic experiments, lowering barriers to entry and empowering a new generation of UK geoscientists. **[RELATED: Seismic nodes deployed to evaluate geothermal heating at RAF Leeming, UK](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/seismis-nodes-deployed-to-evaluate-geothermal-heating-at-raf-leeming-england/)**",

    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "15 May 2025",
    "content": "With much geothermal potential in Utah still undeveloped, local lawmakers and industry leaders are calling on streamlined federal permitting. In the US, several Utah lawmakers and representatives of geothermal developers and operators made the case for improved government support for geothermal development during an oversight field hearing held by the House Committee on Natural Resources, Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources in Cedar City, Utah. Long permitting times remained the core issue of the hearing, with permits for development on federal land possibly taking more than 10 years to be granted. Behind California and Nevada, Utah is the 3rd state in the US with the largest installed geothermal power generation capacity. The scales are massively skewed however – California and Nevada account for more than 90% of the United States’ capacity, while Utah contributes only 3.2%. Utah Republican Rep. Celeste Maloy argues that geothermal has remained underappreciated and underutilized, and that the lack of investment in geothermal does not match its scale of opportunity. Maloy has proposed the Geothermal Energy Opportunity Act, which gives the US Department of Interior only 60 days to process a geothermal drilling permit. Tim Latimer, CEO of [Fervo Energy,](https://fervoenergy.com/) echoed the woes of long permitting times. _“Today, 90% of geothermal resources lie on federally managed land, but permitting can take up to a decade, much longer than equivalent wind, solar, oil and gas projects. That needs to change.”_ Paul Thomsen, Vice President of Business Development at [Ormat Technologies.](https://www.ormat.com/en/home/a/main/), added the [interagency conflicts](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/ormat-to-downsize-dixie-meadows-geothermal-project-nevada/) further add to the delays caused by long permitting. For instance, the US Fish and Wildlife Services has threatened the Department of Interior with a lawsuit following the granting of geothermal permits that may compromise certain fish species. Thomsen added that he was confident that geothermal permitting can still be done in an environmentally safe manner, even if it was expedited. Beaver County in Utah is famously the site of [the Fervo Cape project](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/blm-announces-project-approval-and-permitting-changes-to-promote-geothermal/), which seeks to established Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) using technologies developed in the shale gas drilling industry. The company has been very successful in securing off-takers for the power from the project, but with California-based utilities such as with [Southern California Edison](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/fervo-signs-320-mw-geothermal-ppa-with-california-utility/), [Clean Power Alliance](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/fervo-adds-18-mw-to-ppa-for-geothermal-power-with-clean-power-alliance/), and [Shell Energy](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/fervo-signs-31-mw-geothermal-ppa-with-shell-energy/). The slow construction of transmission lines, also burdened by federal regulations, has also been a challenge for developing geothermal power facilities. Jake Garfield, deputy director of the Utah Office of Energy Development, recounted that it has taken 16 years to permit the construction of a long transmission line from Wyoming to southern Nevada. _“If we see delays like that for transmission, we’ll never see the full buildout of Utah’s geothermal potential,”_ Garfield concluded. Further, Garfield called on the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to offer up more parcels of land for geothermal lease in Utah. Garfield stated that the BLM has put up more than 160,000 acres of land in Utah in the last five years, but has also offered more than 700,000 acres in Nevada in the same timeframe. A recent BLM geothermal lease sale in Utah succeeded in generating over USD 5.6 million in high bids for 14 parcels. It set a record for generating the most revenue per acre compared to any previous geothermal lease sales on BLM public lands in Utah, indicating higher investor interest for geothermal projects in the state.",

The Hungarian oil and gas company [MOL Group](https://www.molgroup.info/) has started conducting seismic surveys to locate and characterize potential geothermal resources around the company’s Danube Refinery in Százhalombatta, about 20 km SW of Budapest. The aim for the exploration campaign is to determine whether there are high-temperature resources that can help make the refinery’s operations more sustainable. The results of the seismic data acquisition are expected to be available in about six months. If results are encouraging, the company will undertake a further feasibility study for a possible geothermal utilization project. The statement from MOL also notes that there are only few application of geothermal energy in refineries worldwide, and that this initiative can be considered pioneering. The Danube Refinery is one of the biggest in Central and Eastern Europe with a capacity of 165,000 barrels per day. _“The geothermal exploration area awarded to MOL includes Százhalombatta and the Danube Refinery. It is therefore obvious that in addition to mapping the entire area, we will also specifically examine the geothermal potential of the refinery’s surroundings,”_ said Dávid Kapes, Head of Green Energy Transition at MOL Group’s Exploration and Production Division. _“The green transition starts with reducing the emissions of our own operations.

[The project broke ground back in 2022](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-greenhouse-complex-in-dikili-turkiye-holds-groundbreaking-ceremony/) and will cost a total investment amount of 5 billion TL (approx. $123 million) when completed. Dikili OTB Chairman Mehmet Sahin Cakan shared a significant development regarding the infrastructure process. Construction of wastewater, rainwater, utility water, electricity, and telecommunications infrastructure, along with geothermal networks and heating systems, was initiated with a tender published on July 25th. Cakan said, _“Once our infrastructure work is complete, all the necessary groundwork will be in place for OTB participants to begin production. Our goal is to harvest our first crops as soon as possible.”_ With its modern greenhouse infrastructure supported by geothermal energy, Dikili OTB aims to both encourage environmentally friendly production and contribute to regional development.",

    "content": "Elements by BBA//Fjeldco has launched the Elements Guide, a free platform offering detailed legal insights into geothermal and renewable energy regulations. Elements by BBA//Fjeldco, a geothermal energy advisory focused on policy, regulation and development of geothermal resources [has announced the launch of the _Elements Guide_](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/elements-by-bba-fjeldco_elements-by-bbafjeldco-is-proud-to-announce-activity-7336312089554169859-eKeX?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAAfwWIBQ_vzsFkexfiBhkWbZ_zmvCYe7D0), a freely accessible online platform designed to clarify the legal frameworks governing renewable energy—especially geothermal—across jurisdictions. An evolution of the earlier _Geothermal Transparency Guide_ , the _Elements Guide_ expands its scope while maintaining a strong focus on geothermal resources. It provides detailed, country-specific information on legal, regulatory, and policy frameworks affecting the development of geothermal and other renewable energy projects. Legal uncertainty remains a major barrier to geothermal development in many regions. With fragmented or incomplete laws, developers, landowners, and public authorities often face challenges in navigating rights, permits, and obligations. The _Elements Guide_ addresses this by centralizing and simplifying access to legal information. A key feature of the platform is its comparison tool, allowing users to analyze legal frameworks across up to three countries. This supports developers and policymakers in identifying regulatory gaps, alignment opportunities, and investment risks. The guide was created with the support of partner law firms across all included jurisdictions, who contributed pro bono. Participating firms include DLA Piper, Baker McKenzie, BonelliErede, Herbert Smith Freehills, and others.

    "content": "A new report by Cascade Institute examines geothermal policies around the world and makes regulatory recommendations to boost geothermal growth in Canada. The [Cascade Institute](https://cascadeinstitute.org/) has published a report that provides guidance on harmonized and effective geothermal regulations across Canada, thus providing a regulatory roadmap for Canada to harness its vast geothermal potential. The report also looks into international best practices on geothermal regulation, particular from the 10 largest geothermal power producers globally. **[Click here to read the full report, “Groundwork: Regulatory Guidelines for Making Canada a Geothermal Powerhouse.”](https://cascadeinstitute.org/technical-paper/groundwork/)** As the Carney government accelerates major energy infrastructure projects, geothermal is notably absent in Canada’s push for clean and secure energy sources. A major hurdle for this is regulatory, or more specifically, the lack of regulations in most of the country that covers geothermal energy projects. Despite Canada’s[ vast geothermal potential](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/cascade-institute-publishes-roadmap-for-ultradeep-geothermal-power-in-canada/) and world-class drilling expertise, Canada lags far behind the rest of the world, and ten provinces and territories still lack basic geothermal project regulations. Where frameworks do exist, they are inconsistent from one province to the next—making it difficult to launch projects at scale. Drawing lessons from the world’s top ten geothermal power producers, the report provides provinces and territories with actionable guidelines they can use to establish effective regulations to kickstart the nascent industry. _“Geothermal delivers the clean, secure, and always-on power that Canada needs in this time of upheaval,”_ said Emily Smejkal, Policy Lead for the Cascade Institute’s Geothermal Energy Office (CI-GEO) and the report’s lead author. _“We have the technical expertise, we have the resource potential, and now, with this report, we have guidelines to shape effective regulations.”_ International Geothermal Association CEO Marit Brommer said, _“The Cascade Institute’s Groundwork report is a timely and effective intervention that addresses Canada’s biggest challenges head-on. It presents clear, transferable, and future-proof principles that jurisdictions across the country can adopt or adapt immediately.”_ The comprehensive study analyzed regulatory frameworks from the world’s top 10 geothermal producers—including the United States, Indonesia, Philippines, New Zealand, and Iceland—to identify proven approaches that have successfully launched geothermal industries. The report identifies six regulatory best practices common across successful geothermal nations— precise definitions, technology-agnostic regulations, efficient permitting processes, acreage maximums to limit monopolies , realistic timeframes for development, and early public engagement. _“Countries that adopt these regulatory principles have already unlocked billions in geothermal investment globally,”_ said Smejkal. _“Canada has fallen behind, but it’s not too late to catch up.”_ Global geothermal investment is projected to reach US$2.5 trillion by 2050, and Canada’s [oil and gas sector drilling expertise](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/spe-event-to-facilitate-important-conversations-for-geothermal-in-canada/) provides a natural competitive advantage in geothermal development. The report represents Phase 1 of a broader initiative to accelerate geothermal power development across Canada. Cascade Institute’s Geothermal Energy Office, in coordination with industry ,governments, and the International Geothermal Association, will use this report as a springboard for developing detailed model regulations that jurisdictions can adapt and implement. _“The federal government is prioritizing fast-tracked energy projects and federal-provincial coordination, and geothermal can and should lead the way, if we address these regulatory gaps,”_ said Smejkal. _“We’ve identified what works globally and translated it into solutions Canada can use now. We have everything we need to seize this opportunity.”_",

The 25-MW Mori geothermal power plant, by Hokkaido Electric Power (HEPCO), started commercial operations in 1982. In late 2023, the field was further augmented by [a 2-MW binary geothermal power plant](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/mori-binary-geothermal-power-plant-japan-starts-commercial-operations/), operated by Mori Binary Power LLC, a joint venture between HEPCO, JFE Engineering Corporation, and Tokyo Century Corporation. Despite the addition of a binary power plant, there was still sufficient excess hot water from the power plant operations to warrant a geothermal greenhouse facility. Water at 120 °C and a flowrate of 220 t/hour is supplied to a heat exchanger unit, producing water at 65 °C to supply to 97 greenhouses. The project has allowed farmers to maintain a stable income from crop cultivation even during winter season. Geothermal heating offers drastically reduced costs of heating compared to fossil fuel alternatives, from approximately 300 million yen per year to only about 15 million yen per year for the entire region. In an effort to deepen its relationship with the town of Morimachi, Seven-Eleven will be selling cups of Caprese Pasta using the tomatoes made from the geothermal greenhouses. The Mayor of Morimachi, Kosuke Okajima, has a special attachment to this initiative given that he used to run a Seven-Eleven store in Morimachi.",

    "content": "Fervo Energy and Shell Energy ink a 31 MW geothermal PPA in California, highlighting growing demand for 24/7 clean energy, expanding U.S. geothermal capacity. Geothermal developer Fervo Energy has announced a new 31 MW Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Shell Energy North America. The deal marks another significant step forward for geothermal energy in the U.S., reinforcing its role as a scalable, dispatchable clean energy source. This is a milestone deal for geothermal in California. Under the agreement, Shell Energy will purchase 31 megawatts of firm geothermal power from Fervo’s Cape Station project in Beaver County, Utah. The electricity will be delivered to California’s grid, supporting Shell Energy’s power delivery obligations to large energy customers and retail providers across the state. The PPA supports California’s clean energy goals by supplying round-the-clock, zero-emissions electricity that aligns with long-term reliability needs—especially as the state phases out fossil fuels and scales intermittent renewables like solar and wind. **Part of a growing trend in geothermal procurement** This deal adds to a growing list of corporate and utility geothermal PPAs signed in recent years. [Fervo previously secured a 115 MW geothermal PPA](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/google-to-increase-geothermal-power-supply-to-data-centers-via-nevada-utility/) with Google, with power also sourced from its Cape Station development. “Shell Energy is proud to collaborate with Fervo to bring more 24/7 clean electricity to the grid,” said Glenn Wright, President of Shell Energy North America. “This agreement supports our goal of helping customers decarbonize with firm renewable power.” **Advanced technology unlocking new potential** Fervo’s Cape Station project uses enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) and advanced drilling techniques adapted from the oil and gas industry. This approach enables geothermal development in areas previously inaccessible, dramatically expanding potential resources. According to Fervo, the Cape Station site is expected to come online in 2026 and, once completed, will be the largest next-generation geothermal project in the U.S. This latest PPA with Shell Energy further cements geothermal’s growing value as a firm, clean energy solution that complements intermittent sources. As more corporations and utilities seek 24/7 carbon-free electricity, geothermal is becoming a cornerstone in clean energy portfolios. With this agreement, Fervo continues to demonstrate how innovative geothermal development can support grid reliability, emissions reduction, and scalable decarbonization—key priorities in both California and global energy markets.

    "content": "As part of this year's NZGW, New Zealand has launched a draft geothermal action plan with the aim of doubling geothermal energy use by 2040. New Zealand Resources Minister Shane Jones has launched a draft strategy that aims to double geothermal energy use in New Zealand by 2040. Consultation on the draft strategy is now open [via the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/have-your-say/consultation-on-a-draft-geothermal-strategy-for-new-zealand). The document, **“From the Ground Up – A draft strategy to unlock New Zealand’s geothermal potential”** was launched as part of this year’s [New Zealand Geothermal Week](https://www.taupo.biz/nzgeothermalweek2025) held in Taupo and organized by [Amplify](https://www.taupo.biz/) and the [New Zealand Geothermal Association](https://www.nzgeothermal.org.nz/) (NZGA). _“Today, geothermal accounts for just under 20 per cent of our electricity generation. We are the fifth largest generator of geothermal in the world. Unlike hydro, wind or solar power, it isn’t reliant on the weather, and provides a clean, consistent and resilient power source,”_ said Jones in a speech during the launch event. _“Beyond electricity generation, direct geothermal energy is an enabler of industrial, commercial and agricultural activity. Currently there is over seven petajoules in direct geothermal heat use in pulp and papermaking, wood processing, dairy manufacturing and greenhouses each year.”_ Despite geothermal being closely tied with the history of New Zealand, there are still several factors that are holding back its further growth. The Minister cites the lack of centralized exploration data, the lack of information for investment decision-making, and outdated regulations as some of the major factors. To address these gaps, the draft strategy proposes a number of actions with defined timelines. The action plan goals can be classified as such: * Improving access to geothermal data and insights * Ensuring regulatory and systems settings are fit for purpose * Advancing knowledge and uptake of geothermal technologies * Enabling place-based geothermal clusters * Driving science, research and innovation, including supercritical geothermal technology The Minister makes special mention of the progress that New Zealand has made in the realm of supercritical geothermal. In late 2024, the Government of New Zealand announced that [it has ringfenced $60 million from the Regional Infrastructure Fund](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-zealand-to-invest-60-million-on-supercritical-geothermal-research/) to support this sector. Some $5 million has now been drawn down from the budget for work on the detailed design and cost to drill the first of three exploratory deep wells in the Taupo Volcanic Zone. Discussions are still ongoing to narrow down the site for the first well, and drilling is expected to started in 2026.",

    "content": "Hungary is preparing multiple tender rounds to provide funding for geothermal heat and power projects in line with the National Geothermal Strategy. Starting mid-July 2025, the Hungarian Government through the Jedlik Ányos Energy Program opened the social consultation for a planned series of tenders for projects to boost the utilization of geothermal energy. The [draft of the first tender](https://www.palyazat.gov.hu/kozlemenyek/tarsadalmi-egyeztetesen-a-geotermikus-furasi-kockazatok-csokkentese-cimu-felhivas-tervezete) is now available and comments will be accepted until 15 August 2025. A total of HUF 41 billion (approx. USD 120 million) will be made available for geothermal-based developments through the tenders. HUF 10 billion has been allocated for the first tender round, which seeks to subsidize the first well drilling of a project. From the budget, projects implemented in 10-20 rural locations can receive at least HUF 40 million (approx. USD 117,000) but no more than HUF 1 billion in support (approx. USD 2.9 million). If the drilling proves successful, the state contribution can cover one tenth of the total eligible costs, while in case of failure it can cover up to half. The deadline for physical completion is two years from the entry into force of the support contract, but no later than the end of 2028. Another call for proposals will provide HUF 12 billion to support the development of a grid-connected geothermal heat and electricity generation system based on an existing production and injection well. The entire amount can be used to implement a single development. Any area of the country, except Budapest, can be considered as an investment location. The third call for proposals, which is currently being prepared, offers the largest amount of funding to industry investors. This program element can stimulate geothermal heat generation investments with an interest-free loan of HUF 19 billion, including the assumption of drilling costs if required. The funding initiative is in line with [the National Geothermal Strategy published by the Ministry of Energy in 2024](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/hungary-publishes-national-strategy-to-double-geothermal-output-by-2030/), which sets a goal to double domestic energy use in Hungary by 2030. With base output of 6.4 PJ, the Ministry is targeting growth to 8 PJ by 2026, and to 12-13 PJ by 2030.",

    "content": "Initial discharge tests have started for the first deep geothermal project in Vienna, Austria, aiming to gather data for the design of the eventual geothermal heating plant. The first discharge tests have now started for the **“deeep,”** the deep geothermal project in the Aspern district in Vienna, Austria being jointly developed by [OMV](https://www.omv.com/de) and [Wien Energie](https://www.wienenergie.at/). This test will last approximately one week, during which temperatures, volumes, and the chemical composition of the waters will be analyzed. Such tests will be instrumental in gathering data before designing the above-ground infrastructure, including the heating plant. Drilling for a three-well program [started in December 2024](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/drilling-starts-for-first-deep-geothermal-project-in-vienna-austria/) and was completed by July 2025. The wells reached a depth of approximately 3000 meters. During the discharge test, up to 3400 cubic meters of water will be pumped from depth to the surface and into reservoirs. This will be followed by another test during the 2025/2026 winter season, where both extraction and reinjection will be done simultaneously for the first time. The results from both tests are expected by the spring of 2026. _“With the findings from the extraction tests, we can finalize the planning of the above-ground plant – i.e., those plant components required for transferring heat from the formation water to the district heating network. This will be followed by the construction of the plant. Vienna’s first deep geothermal plant will then serve as our blueprint for further expansion: By 2040, we aim to generate sustainable district heating for up to 200,000 Viennese households with several plants_ ,” said Wien Energie Managing Directors Michael Strebl and Karl Gruber. In total, OMV and Wien Energie aim to develop deep geothermal plants with a capacity of approximately 200 megawatts to meet this demand. The partners plan to implement up to seven deep geothermal plants in Vienna. Several wells and plant sites are planned to be constructed in parallel, giving the benefit of more efficient resource use. The exact implementation schedule and the performance of these additional plants depend on the findings from the pilot plant in Aspern. _“All Viennese residents should be able to heat their homes in a climate-friendly way by 2040. District heating is a key technology for this. With heat from 3,000 meters underground, we are making district heating sustainable step by step_ ,” explains Ulli Sima, City Councilor for Urban Development, Mobility and Vienna Public Utilities. _“With the deep production tests, we are now letting the subsurface speak for itself. For OMV, geothermal energy is a key element of the responsible transformation to a low-carbon company. We are committed to concrete measures to reduce CO? emissions and are thus making an active contribution to a sustainable and reliable energy supply. Thanks to our decades of experience in the oil and gas business, we have the necessary expertise in geosciences and drilling technology to make geothermal energy available as an energy source_ ,” added Berislav Gašo, Executive Vice President Energy and member of the OMV Executive Board.",

    "date": "26 May 2025",
    "content": "The USGS has published the results of a study estimating EGS potential in the Great Basin, highlighting substantial geothermal growth potential in the US. The [United States Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/) (USGS) highlights the electricity generating potential using Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) technology in the Great Basin region in the United States, encompassing the entirety of Nevada and parts of California, Utah, Arizona, Oregon, and Idaho. The data indicates a current best provisional estimate of 135 GWe from the upper 6 kilometers of the Earth’s crust. The new report is an update to a 2008 assessment done by USGS on the geothermal potential of the Great Basin. Provided new technologies and more refined scientific understanding, the USGS deemed it proper to do an updated evaluation. The Energy Act of 2020 also directed the USGS to update or conduct new assessments of geothermal resource in the conterminous United States, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Following are the links to the materials related to the study: * [Short report and factsheet](https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2025/3027/fs20253027.pdf) * [Data files and map files](https://doi.org/10.5066/P14LU7WD) The study notes that continued technological improvement can greatly increase the potential power production from EGS, possibly to more than ten times the base estimate. This can also be increased improving the conversion efficiencies of power plants, although this was not considered in the estimates. Conversely, there is a wide margin on uncertainty in the estimates, related to the uncertainty of models of several physical parameters (~45%) and uncertainty to the portion of the geology that could be developed using EGS technologies. (more than 1000%). Thus, these estimates have to be treated with caution and discussed at the proper levels of nuance. As technologies are demonstrated and understanding of three-dimensional geology is improved, uncertainty will decline. If technologies continue to improve, then viable EGS resource estimates will increase because more heat is accessible for the generation of electricity. _“USGS assessments of energy resources are about the future,”_ said Sarah Ryker, acting director of the USGS. “ _We focus on undiscovered resources that have yet to be fully explored, let alone developed. We launched this work in the Great Basin because of the area’s history of geothermal activity – and we found even more potential for baseload power than had previously been known. Leveraging this work along with artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques will help us assess the entire nation’s potential for geothermal energy with greater speed and accuracy.”_ **[RELATED: Utah FORGE extended circulation test confirms EGS connectivity and heat extraction](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/utah-forge-extended-circulation-test-confirms-egs-connectivity-and-heat-extraction/)**",

    "content": "Vulcan Energy, through Vercana, has started drilling their first new geothermal well near Landau, Germany, which will supply both sustainable heat and lithium. Commencement of drilling at Schleidberg represents the fifth well in Vulcan’s Phase One Project area. The company currently already operates four production and reinjection wells, having [acquired the assets of Geox GmbH](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/vulcan-to-streamline-geothermal-lithium-operations-in-germany-with-acquisition/) last year. The Field Development Plan targets the addition of 24 production and reinjection wells to support the integrated geothermal energy and lithium project. Just about a month ago, Vulcan Energy [resumed district heating supply](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/vulcan-resumes-geothermal-district-heating-supply-in-landau-germany/) from the Landau geothermal heating plant, initially supply 2 MWth of heating or equivalent to the needs of about 320 households. Heat from the new wells will expand geothermal heating capacity in Landau, which is an essential part of the HEAT4LANDAU project. Moreover, brine from the wells will allow for the production of around 24,000 tonnes per annum of lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LHM) for electric vehicle batteries. _“Start of drilling new production wells to grow current production represents achievement of yet another critical milestone for our Lionheart Project,”_ said Vulcan Energy Managing Director and CEO Cris Moreno. _“This development means Vulcan is one step closer to delivering our mission of establishing a sustainable, European-based lithium supply chain, delivering both baseload renewable heating and lithium production for electric vehicle batteries.”_",

    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "11 Sep 2025",
    "content": "The Legislative Assembly of El Salvador has approved the Geothermal Energy Law, providing a framework for the granting of geothermal concessions. With 57 affirmative votes from the 60 members of the Legislative Assembly, the new Geothermal Energy Law of El Salvador has been approved. This follows [the proposal made by President Nayib Bukele](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-bill-proposes-private-investment-in-el-salvador-geothermal-sector/) through the Ministry of Economy. The law has 83 articles, providing a robust framework for geothermal development in El Salvador, particularly for the granting of concessions to private companies. The following are some of the highlights of the Geothermal Energy Law: * Geothermal concessions may be approved for private investors through public bidding, or in some cases without public bidding, for up to 30 years. * The [General Directorate of Hydroelectric and Mining Energy](https://www.dgehm.gob.sv/) (DGEHM) will conduct public tenders for areas with geothermal potential. * In some cases, concessions may be granted without public bidding. Direct awarding is possible for projects declared of national interest by the DGEHM, “when it is justified that their development is strategic for energy security, economic development, and/or national well-being.” * The concession must be approved by the Legislative Assembly. * Interested parties must submit exploration plans to the DGEHM. The agency then has 45 days to decide on exploration requests. These can be granted for up to 36 months for up to 50 square kilometers. The companies doing exploration will have preferential rights. * The DGEHM will supervise and oversee compliance with the concession contract during its execution, construction, generation, operation, or abandonment. * Individuals or companies holding concessions or making new investments in geothermal generation projects will be exempt from Income Tax, Import Duties, and all types of taxes on income from the sale of reduced emission certificates or renewable energy, among others. * Foreign concessionaires must establish a company in El Salvador. * The law allows for expropriations of areas with geothermal potential. Some members of the Legislative Assembly voiced their criticisms of the law. For instance, Claudia Ortiz of the VAMOS party, criticized the provision for the direct awarding of contracts, saying that does not favor transparency and may increase the risk of corruption. Representative Francisco Lira also pointed out that the bill was not consulted with academics, experts, and members of the communities. However, amendments made based on these opposing views were not passed. One article was deleted upon the request of Representative Dania González, which identified the fields of Ahuachapán, Berlín, Chinameca, San Vicente, Obrajuelo, Conchagua, Chilanguera, and Santa Rosa de Lima as “exploitation rights areas” currently exploited by CEL or its subsidiaries.",

    "content": "A delegation from Energía Geotérmica de Canarias visited the Azores to learn about the islands' geothermal development model and adapt learnings for Tenerife. A delegation from [Energía Geotérmica de Canarias](https://geotermiadetenerife.com/) (EGC) traveled to the island of São Miguel, in the Azores, to gain firsthand knowledge on the archipelago’s geothermal development model and how it can be adapted to geothermal plans in Tenerife. The highlight of the trip was the visit to the 10-MW Pico Vermelho geothermal power plant, owned and operated by EDA Renováveis. Together with the [Ribeira power plant](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/eda-renovaveis-signs-exergy-for-ribeira-grande-geothermal-plant-revitalization-azores/), geothermal supplies about 33% of the renewable energy production in the island. Efforts are also underway[ to expand the capacities of both facilities](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/consortium-awarded-contract-for-pico-vermelho-geothermal-expansion-azores/), with the target of increasing renewable energy contribution to 53% by 2027 from the current 21%. The meeting included a technical presentation by EDA Renováveis, which addressed the geothermal experience in the Azores, led by António Luis Peixoto. The presentation reviewed the history of geothermal development in the Portuguese archipelago, the potential for generating this energy source in the region, and its associated socioeconomic and environmental benefits. EGC is a public-private consortium that is seeking to start geothermal development in the island of Tenerife. The members of the consortium include Icelandic company [Reykjavík Geothermal](https://rg.is/), energy company DISA, and the government of Tenerife through the public companies Technological Institute and Renewable Energies ([Instituto Tecnológico y Energías Renovables](https://www.iter.es/) / ITER) and the Canary Islands Volcanological Institute ([Involcan)](https://involcan.org/involcan-2/). According to previous announcements, EGC is targeting[ the start of drilling of a geothermal exploration well in Tenerife](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/first-geothermal-drilling-in-tenerife-canary-islands-to-begin-by-fall-2025/) before the end of 2025. DISA Energía ‘s director , Santiago Rull , remarked on the similarities between Azores and the Canary Islands: _“the Azores are an ultraperipheral region, like the Canary Islands, that is very advanced from an energy perspective because they have been using this type of renewable energy for more than 45 years. It’s a solution that, given the nature of our archipelago, must be part of our energy mix.”_ _“The Canary Islands are immersed in the process of exploring and thoroughly investigating all aspects related to systems for harnessing this type of energy. We want to have the information to disseminate its benefits to the public, and we want them to be able to see examples like the one in the Azores with all the safety guarantees,”_ added Julieta Schallenberg, Deputy Minister for Ecological Transition, the Fight against Climate Change, and Energy of the Canary Islands Government. ITER Director Carlos Suarez further emphasized that the visit was strategic, as it gave the delegation an insight on the impact that geothermal can have on an island region like the Azores, as well all the advantages geothermal can offer to electricity generation in an island system. The possibility of using this energy in Tenerife and the Canary Islands means reducing production costs, which currently hover around €300 per MWh. This could translate into up to a 30% reduction in bills. The use of geothermal also puts the Canary Islands on the path of meeting the goals set by the Climate Change and Ecological Transition Law, which sets the islands’ decarbonization target at 90% by 2040.",

A new urban district to be built in the city of Neuss in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany will benefit from geothermal heating and cooling, as well as electricity from solar PV systems. The start of construction for the urban district is planned by the spring of 2026, but drilling of the geothermal probes has already started. Under development by the[ P+B Group](https://www.pplusb.com/), the NEULAND NEUSS urban district will have around 450 residential units, with 33% of the area to developed as publicly subsidized apartments. There will also be daycare centers, co-working spaces, a hotel, cultural and dining options, and other social infrastructure. The district is being built at the site of the former Bauer & Schaurte screw factory. District heating and cooling solutions will be provided by a field of 107 geothermal probes, each drilled to a depth of approximately 200 meters. Temperature will be managed during both winter and summer by a combination of water-to-water heat pumps and water-cooled chillers. The roofs of the buildings will be equipped with solar PV systems to supply electricity. The combination of these technologies makes the energy supply of the planned urban district largely CO2-neutral. To this regard, the project has already been recognized as a KlimaQuartier.NRW project by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. _“With our NEULAND® neighborhood brand, we have developed an innovative concept that meets all the ecological and social challenges of our time.

    "content": "The developer of a geothermal heating project in Munster, Germany has acquired two former natural gas wells from ExxonMobil, reducing the cost of the project. A geothermal heating project in the city of Munster in Lower Saxony, Germany is now expected to be completed faster and cheaper because of the acquisition of two ExxonMobil wells originally drilled for natural gas extraction. Some completion work will be needed, but both wells are expected to be ready by the end of 2025. The project aims to use geothermal energy to supply the heating network in the city of Munster. Heide-Geo GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of [Stadtwerke Munster-Bispingen GmbH](https://www.ihr-stadtwerk.de/), is in charge of the drilling site. In 2023, the utility company [received the approval for a EUR 7.1 million grant](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-project-in-munster-germany-receives-eur-7-million-state-funding/) from the Ministry for the Environment, Energy, and Climate Protection for the geothermal project. With the acquisition, Heide-Geo now owns the open Munster Southwest Z3 well and the backfilled Munster North Z2 well, which are located just a few meters apart and provides a foundation for a geothermal doublet. The drilling company KCA-Deutag, which has just been awarded the contract through a tender process, will complete both wells. A previous release from the company stated that the Z3 well was offered by ExxonMobil at almost no cost, thus massively reducing the total cost for the project. Moreover, the company has secured the heating supply contract for the German Armed Forces base in Munster. _“With the state subsidy of €7 million, we can complete both boreholes,”_ explains Jan Niemann, head of Munster’s municipal utilities and Heide-Geo. _“Perhaps even for less.”_ _“We’re deepening the first borehole by a few meters to reach the main layer of the water-bearing rock,”_ explains Hans-Herbert Achilles, Heide-Geo’s technical project manager. ExxonMobil also expressed support for the project. _“We are very pleased to support the expansion of renewable energies at the municipal level by transferring this well,”_ said Jens-Christian Senger, Managing Director of ExxonMobil Germany.",

At a recent community information event, bus and truck manufacturer [MAN Truck & Bus SE](https://www.man.eu/corporate/en/homepage.html) (MAN) along with municipal government representatives discussed the details of a planned geothermal heating project in in the municipality of Karlsfeld in Bavaria, Germany. The project aims to replace the current gas-fired heating plant of MAN with geothermal, which will then be supplied as well to the existing district heating network. The project [was first reported in early 2024](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/man-to-partner-with-karlsfeld-germany-for-geothermal-heating-project/), but more information on it has now been revealed by the company. MAN has secured the geothermal exploration rights for the Karlsfeld-Nord area, which extends largely into the Dachau region. The Karlsfeld-Ost area was the ideal are, stated the company, but this had already been claimed by MTU Aero & Engines[ for their own geothermal heating project.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/drilling-of-geothermal-doublet-in-mtu-facility-in-germany-completed/) Drilling for the project is scheduled to begin by the second quarter of 2026. The identified drilling site is in a land owned by the municipality, located in the planned industrial park south of Schleißheimer Straße, and is being leased to future operating company Geothermie Karlsfeld GmbH. The target drilling depth is at around 2000 meters, where water at 70 – 75 °C is expected. This is is also the site where the heat exchangers and other surface equipment will be installed. By summer 2028, the goal is for MAN’s heating plant and the municipal combined heating and power plant to be connected to the district heating network. The representatives at the information meeting could not comment yet on the investment figures for the project, nor how it will influence connection and heating costs.

    "content": "A research team from the University of Auckland is evaluating the use of geothermal energy to complement heating systems in Auckland, New Zealand. A research team led by Associate Professor Sadiq J. Zarrouk, co-director of the [University of Auckland’s Geothermal Institute](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/engineering/our-research/engineering-research/research-areas-and-facilities/geothermal-institute.html), has begun drilling beneath the city of Auckland in New Zealand to evaluate how geothermal heat can be used to complement home and business heating systems. Working in collaboration with water well drilling company [Drill Force NZ Ltd](https://www.drillforce.co.nz/), the team is collecting temperature data from a well in Takanini to assess the feasibility of using geothermal to cut water heating costs in households and businesses. The project could transform how buildings are heated by tapping into a sustainable and underused energy source, says Zarrouk, and could save households up to $20 per month, based on the average water heating costs of a typical household. _“The long-term vision is to make the technology low-cost and simple to implement in both new builds and existing buildings. The goal is to see it adopted widely as a clean, cost-effective energy solution,”_ said Zarrouk. The technology works by drilling a shallow well near the property and running a water pipe through it. As the water flows through the pipe, it absorbs natural heat from the ground. This raises the water temperature by a few degrees, meaning less electricity is needed to heat it to the desired level – ultimately reducing overall energy use and power bills. A special phase-change material that is used to efficiently store and distribute thermal energy will help to balance energy demand during peak usage times, according to Zarrouk. The research team installed 15 sensors in the well to monitor temperature changes down to 20 metres below ground level. The data is being analysed using machine learning tools to help optimise the design of a second well, which is due to be drilled in the coming months. Both wells will be monitored over the next year to better understand seasonal temperature behaviour. If results are promising, heat extraction systems will be installed to test the technology further. _“As the first study of its kind in Aotearoa New Zealand, this research has the potential to change the country’s energy use, paving the way for more sustainable and affordable heating options. If successful, the findings could provide long-term scientific and practical benefits, reducing reliance on traditional power sources,”_ says Zarrouk. **[RELATED: New Zealand tissue and toilet paper company shifts to 100% geothermal](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-zealand-tissue-and-toilet-paper-company-shifts-to-100-geothermal/)**",

    "content": "The city of Szeged, Hungary has received funding from the Swiss Fund for a project to reduce methane emissions during the drilling of geothermal wells. With plans to further expand the current geothermal district heating network, the city of Szeged, Hungary are undertaking a project to reduce methane gas emissions for all subsequent geothermal drilling operations. Thermal waters hosted in the Great Plain (Alföld) contain a relatively large amount of gases, including methane. Since methane is considered a major greenhouse gas, even more so than carbon dioxide, the project aims to prevent its release into the atmosphere. The goal now is to separate the methane, dry it, and burn it as natural gas. Thus, the project will also produce additional energy. While there is currently no legislation that prohibits the release of methane gases, it is expected that such a regulation will be in power by 2027. To fund this program, [Geo Hoterm Kft](https://geohoterm.hu/), along with the city district heating company, secured an investment of nearly HUF 1 billion (approx. USD 3 million) from the Swiss Fund following a tender. Dániel Mészáros, project manager of Geo Hoterm, further said that they have submitted two applications for [the recently launched Jedlik Ányos Program](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/hungary-to-open-tender-for-geothermal-transition-of-district-heating-operations/) for connection of the thermal circuits, and for the use of heat pumps for lower-temperature thermal water.

Several groups from the Bollenstreek region of the Netherlands have presented a manifesto to the House of Representatives in The Hague calling for a strong national support for the development of geothermal energy for heating in the region. The municipalities of Noordwijk, Lisse, Teylingen and Hillegom, the Holland Rijnland region, housing associations [Stek Wonen](https://www.stek-wonen.nl/) and [Padua](https://www.ws-padua.nl/) and initiator[ Aardwarmte Rijnland](https://aardwarmterijnland.nl/) jointly request: * Accelerated introduction of the Collective Heating Act * A financial boost of EUR 300 to 400 million to guarantee affordability of geothermal installations for residents and businesses The signatories of the manifesto[ had previously signed letter of intent to jointly evaluate the potential for a large-scale geothermal heating network](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/multi-municipality-geothermal-district-heating-signed-in-netherlands/) in Bollenstreek. Of the proposed funding, EUR 120 million will be designated as pre-investment in the pipeline for regional heat supply. The remaining will be used to ensure an affordable energy bill for 50,00o to 70,000 residents and companies in the region. The manifesto states that such investment will result in structural and social costs savings of up to EUR 800 million compared to a scenario of all-electric heat pumps. Geothermal energy in the Rijnland region has the potential of delivering up to 1,500,000 GJ of sustainable heat per year. This can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 100 tons per year, and create annual savings up up to 70 million cubic meters of natural gas. Currently, almost 80% of the heat in the region comes from, mainly foreign, natural gas. This makes households, industry and SMEs vulnerable to high gas prices as a result of geopolitical tensions. Without a regional heating network, the growing number of heat pumps will mean that the local grid will before full due to an additional power demand of 110 MVA. Grid congestion due to an all-electric heating transition can cost the region EUR 400 to 500 million annually in lost economic activity and postponed sustainability. The proposed heating network will allow residents to switch to geothermal energy free of charge. Homes will be supplied with guaranteed stable and sustainable heat, and will not have to resort to drastic insulation measures and major renovations.",

Technical tests on the samples are ongoing, and these findings strongly align with the electrical conductivity anomalies identified in Tank and his team’s study.[ ](https://www.jeotermalhaberler.com/erciyes-dagi-eteklerinde-jeotermal-kaynak-arama-calismalari-basliyor/) Meanwhile, the region’s geothermal potential is being utilized not only for energy and tourism, but also for agricultural production. [Work is progressing rapidly on ](https://www.jeotermalhaberler.com/kayseride-jeotermal-kaynakli-sera-osbde-calismalar-hizla-ilerliyor/)the Geothermal Greenhouse Organized Industrial Zone project, established in the Elmali neighborhood of Kocasinan. Ten wells are planned for the project, with a target temperature of 60°C and a flow rate of 70 liters per second. This initiative demonstrates that the geothermal potential indicated by academic research around Mount Erciyes can be directly translated into economic and social benefits. In conclusion, the electrical conductivity anomalies discovered deep within Mount Erciyes, combined with geothermal exploration, drilling, and greenhouse projects in the region, offer significant contributions to Türkiye’s vision for sustainable development in energy, agriculture, and tourism. When academic data and field applications are considered together, Erciyes is not only a geological landmark but also on its way to becoming a powerful hub for future geothermal energy. **Source** : Email notification via our Turkish language platform [JeotermalHaberler](https://www.jeotermalhaberler.com/erciyes-daginin-altindaki-elektriksel-iletkenlik-anomalileri-ortaya-cikarildi/) Tags SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE * Follow Think GeoEnergy * [About Us](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/about/) * [Terms & Condition](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/about/terms-conditions/) * [Privacy Policy](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/about/privacy-policy/) * [Advertisement](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/advertisement/) * [Our Advertisers](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/our-advertisers/) * [Support](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/support-us/) * [ENGLISH](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/) * [EN ESPAÑOL](http://www.piensageotermia.com/) * [IN TURKISH](http://www.jeotermalhaberler.com/) All rights reserved. © ThinkGeoEnergy ehf. 2025 We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

    "content": "Low flowrates at the geothermal research well in Gluszyca, Poland make it insufficient for district heating, but alternative applications are being explored. After testing of a 2500-meter geothermal research borehole in Gluszyca, Poland, the flowrate of the well was evaluated to be too low to support plans for municipal heating and a geothermal pool. However, the commune is looking into the possibility of using the mineralized water for medicinal or balneological applications. Drilling of the geothermal research well in Gluszyca[ started in March 2024](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/drilling-of-geothermal-research-well-starts-in-gluszyca-poland/). Poland’s [National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management](https://www.gov.pl/web/nfosigw-en) (NFOSiGW) funded a large part of the project with a PLN 15.4 million (approx. USD 4.3 million) grant. Although the bottom hole temperature was measured at 75 °C, the temperature at the surface was less than 20 °C. This is mainly because of a very low flowrate of only 0.3 m3/hour. Thus, it is not possible to use the well for space heating. The commune is currently looking into the option of utilizing the medicinal properties of the water. “ _On the one hand, experts are persuading me to conduct the tests again, because they may be different from the first ones. Secondly – these mineral waters that we have may indicate that Gluszyca may slowly think about going to spa waters, because there are similar waters in Swieradów-Zdrój, with exactly similar parameters,”_ said Roman Glod, the Mayor of Gluszyca. Researchers are also looking into the possibility of installing a downhole heat exchanger, or even attempting another well testing program. All these ideas are still being explored and there is no final decision yet on the direction of the geothermal project.",

    "content": "HD ehf has completed one of their most complex turbine repair projects for a geothermal power plant in Iceland, making a milestone for the domestic industry. Industrial and technical services company [HD ehf.](https://hd.is/en/) has reported the successful completion of a major turbine maintenance and upgrade job on a geothermal power plant by [ON Power](https://www.on.is/) (Onur Náttúrunnar) in Iceland. Considered one of the company’s largest and most complex maintenance projects ever carried out on a geothermal turbine, the project is a demonstration of the how far the Icelandic industry has come in its specialization in the field of geothermal power plant maintenance. The maintenance project involved a complete overhaul of the rotor, which is the rotating shaft of the turbine, with extensive repairs. The two stages of the rotor that had suffered the most damage were welded up and rebuilt. New blades were manufactured and installed with great precision where needed. The generator armature was also rewound. Significant repairs were then made to the turbine’s structural frame – the support system that keeps this heavy piece of equipment stable and safe in operation. Finally, a complete inspection of the entire engine assembly was carried out. _“We anticipate that these improvements will significantly extend the life of the equipment, improve efficiency and strengthen the security of energy production,”_ says Lýður Skúlason, Managing Director of HD’s Energy and Environment Division. Aside from the repair work, HD also did a complete upgrade of the computer equipment and sensors critical to the operations of the turbine complex. Finally, a precise balancing of all equipment was carried out under full load, i.e. the equipment was run at maximum capacity and fine-tuned to ensure that no imbalance caused vibration or wear. This is another milestone as this marks the first time that domestic contractors did a complete balancing of a geothermal turbine in Iceland. _“It is important to build domestic maintenance and response capacity to ensure the operational security of energy infrastructure,”_ commented irna Björnsdóttir, Director of Energy Production at Orka náttúrunnar._“Sustainable maintenance is not just an advantage but a key component in reliable and safe operations.”_ **[RELATED: HD ehf signs equipment contract for expansion of Svartsengi geothermal, Iceland](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/hd-ehf-signs-equipment-contract-for-expansion-of-svartsengi-geothermal-iceland/)**",

    "date": "15 Aug 2025",
    "content": "Nicaragua national agencies have cancelled the contract for exploitation of the Momotombo geothermal power plant, citing involvement in illegal operations. _**Editors Note:** We recognize the complicated history of politics in Nicaragua during the last several decades. As it is firmly outside of our field of expertise, we are refraining from making any comments on these political affairs. This report is based only on the facts published by Nicaraguan agencies in official documents, as well as developments directly relevant to the geothermal industry._ The Attorney General’s Office (PGJ) of Nicaragua has officially canceled the contract for the exploitation of geothermal resources at the Momotombo plant due to corruption and money laundering charges brought to the owners of the operating company, Momotombo Power Company. The owners of the company, retired General Álvaro Baltodano Cantarero, and his son, Álvaro Baltodano Monroy, have been accused of creating 20 shell companies used for money laundering and tax evasion. According to the statement by PGJ, the evidence gathered by the National Police and the Attorney General’s Office revealed a direct connection between Momotombo Power Company and the shell companies. Such companies were established in foreign jurisdictions classified as tax havens by the Financial Action Task Force. Moreover, the Ministry of Energy and Mines stated that the Momotombo Power Company failed to execute the works agreed upon the exploitation contract, which obligated the company to expand its operating capacity to 37-40 MW. Exploitation of geothermal resources at the Momotombo site started in 1983 with the operations of the 35-MW Momotombo 1 power plant. This was followed in 1989 with a 35-MW Unit 2 power plant, and an 8-MW binary unit that came online later. Despite having an installed capacity of about 78 MWe, productivity of the Momotombo geothermal field has been unstable since 1987. As of 2013, the operating capacity at Momotombo was stated to be only 25 MWe. In 2013, [Ormat Techologies sold its stake of the Momotombo geothermal power project](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/ormat-sells-stake-in-momotombo-plant-in-nicaragua-for-7-5m/) to the Momotombo Power Company. With the revocation of the contract, the assumption is that ownership and management of the existing geothermal power facilities revert to the national government via the state-owned Nicaraguan Electricity Company (ENEL). The statement by the PGJ went to say that _“the State of the Republic of Nicaragua reiterates its commitment to the defense of the National Heritage, transparency in public management, and the strengthening of the rule of law, ensuring that energy services continue to be provided without interruption and under lawful and responsible management.”_ _“Corrupt individuals who, using domestic or foreign corporate structures, disguise themselves as investments to cover up crimes will not be tolerated; accordingly, all those responsible, whether individuals or legal entities, domestic or foreign, will be prosecuted,”_ the statement further says.",

    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "4 Sep 2025",
    "content": "After years of legal dispute over ownership, the company operating the Velika Ciglena geothermal power plant in Croatia has been placed under bankruptcy. The Commercial Court in Zagreb, Croatia has opened bankruptcy proceedings against Geo Power Energy Development doo, the owner and operator of the 16.5-MW Velika Ciglena geothermal power plant. With this, account of owner Dragan Jurilj with an amount of EUR 19.7 million has been blocked and subjected to legal supervision. The Velika Ciglena geothermal power plant [was inaugurated in 2019](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/croatias-first-geothermal-plant-officially-inaugurated/), then under Geoeon doo, a partnership between Turkish company MB Holding (80%) and Dragan Jurilj (20%). The company Geo Power Energy Development was eventually created as a result of reorganization of Geoeon. At the time, the plant had a 10-MW power purchase contract with[ Croatian Energy Market Operator](https://www.hrote.hr/) (Hrvatski operator tržišta energije d.o.o. / HROTE), accounting for the electricity consumption of about 29,000 Croatian households. With several government officials, including an ambassador from Türkiye, in attendance, the inauguration of the Velika Ciglena power plant was perceived as a strong driver for further geothermal development in Croatia. MB Holding even expressed an intention to invest in more geothermal projects in the country, specifically eyeing the Legrad site. The output of Velika Ciglena did not quite reach its full potential, with the power plant “temporarily” halting operations in 2022. It has not resumed operations since then. Several legal disputes have happened between MB Holding and Jurilj since Velika Ciglena started operating. The allegations have gone both ways. The Turkish partners has filed criminal charges against Jurilj, stating that they have effectively been kicked out of the partnership through the use of falsified documents. Moreover, MB Holding alleges that Jurilj as siphoned off tens of millions of Euros from the company Geoeon. For his part, Jurilj also filed several criminal charges against MB Holding, stating that the company also falsified documents, specifically the minutes of an official company assembly. There are also allegations of unjustified payments from the funds of Geoeon that were paid by HROTE, as well as making fraudulent transactions. The conflict between the two parties have been elevated to arbitration, with Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and Turkish President Erdogan said to have discussed it during an international summit. In 2021, the legal dispute was brought to the European Court of Human Rights Due to the ongoing legal dispute concerning the Velika Ciglena power plant, HROTE suspended the payout of state subsidies to the company. The project was due to receive more than EUR 130 million of state incentives until 2031. HROTE made a proposal to the court to establish a court deposit for the remaining state incentives, but the proposal was denied. The decision was made in February 2022, thus resulting in the halting of operations of Velika Ciglena. Moreover, Jurilj has accused HROTE of paying an amount of HRK 25 million into a foreign account. Without access to payments from HROTE, Jurilk expressed the difficulty of making tax payments related to the project. The proposal to open bankruptcy proceedings was made by HROTE on September 2025. Jurilj opposed the decision, stating that the company will lose its status as a privileged electricity producer if it goes into bankruptcy. This means that the electricity offtake contract with HROTE will be automatically lost. Jurilj argues that this is not a standard bankruptcy case since his company delivered electricity to HROTE, but payment were made into a court deposit rather than the company’s account. However, HROTE retorts that the final decision states that the debtor is not entitled to compensation, but instead has more obligations to the agency. The bankruptcy proceedings will likely continue to develop over the coming months, but the case of Velika Ciglena is an unfortunate entry in the promising story of [growing geothermal momentum in Croatia](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-resource-above-100-c-confirmed-after-drilling-at-osijek-croatia/).",

    "content": "Geothermal resources in Bjelovar, Croatia are expected to help boost the local and regional economy through thermal spa tourism. With a geothermal resource in the city of Bjelovar, Croatia now confirmed, the city is investing on a thermal spa facility that is expected to boost spa and wellness tourism in the region. Through the use of geothermal water and heat, as well as a photovoltaic power plant, the future[ Terme Bjelovar](https://termebjelovar.hr/) facility will be the first energy-independent thermal facility in Croatia. In March 2024, [drilling and well testing of the first geothermal well in Bjelovar](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/testing-completed-on-geothermal-wells-in-bjelovar-croatia/) was completed. The Koronevo GT-1 well was drilled to a depth of 1260 meters, and discharged fluids at 83 °C at a flowrate of 30 L/s. During a recent conference, **“Thermal Water Under the Magnifying Glass: Quality, Opportunities, Tourism and Health,”** representatives from the Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Health, and the local Bjelovar government provided more information on the planned Bjelavor spa project to the general public. The thermal spa complex will have a gross area of 13,000 square meters. It will have seven pools, including an Olympic-sized pool. The spa will draw water from a shallow geothermal spring, and will use heating and cooling from the deeper geothermal source. Terme Bjelovar is expected to be completed by March 2026 and will open by June of the same year. Dario Hrebak, the Mayor of Bjelovar, expressed how lucky the city was to find an exceptionally high-quality geothermal resource, and gave assurance that the Bjelovar water will not cause any health problems. Dr. Magdalena Ujevi? Bošnjak of the Croatian Institute of Public Health also explained that the health parameters of the waters will be tested twice a month. Terme Bjelovar Director Zvonimir Žarec highlighted the economic impact of the project, saying that 85% of the companies working on the project are from Bjelovar. Thus, a large part of the payments made for work on the project will remain in the local economy. Advisor to the Minister of Tourism Igor Radi? pointed out that tourists who go to spa and wellness destinations typically have better purchasing power and stay longer, thus generating more value. Through the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, the Ministry is funding 13 spa projects in Croatia worth EUR 1.3 billion. Bjelovar, which received EUR 7 million from the fund, is the only greenfield project.",

The [Hawai’i Public Utilities Commission](https://puc.hawaii.gov/) has approved the Repower Project of Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV), the operator of the Puna geothermal power plant in Hawai’i Island. With this, 12 generating units in the power plant will be replaced by more modern and efficient units, thus increasing the totla installed capacity from 38 MW to 46 MW. The new equipment is planned to be used by the end of 2026. _“We have been working on getting this project approval since 2022, and we’re very excited to be able to move ahead. All of it is an improvement,”_ said PGV Senior Director Michael Kaleikini. In early 2024, the company had [finalized a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/ormat-receives-ppa-for-expanded-geothermal-capacity-at-puna-hawaii/) for the added capacity. Kaleikini further explained that the generating units to be replaced have been in service since 1991 to 1993. Replacing it with just three modern units effectively downsizes the project, thus resulting in a smaller footprint despite the increased efficiency and capacity. This also means less noise, less piping, and less potential geothermal emissions. The capacity increase means that the share of electricity from renewable energy sources in Hawai’i will also increase to 68% from the 59% recorded at the end of 2024. Hawaiian Electric Co. also stated that the change in generating units will decrease the electric bill by $23.62 per month for residential consumers averaging 500 kWh per month. An environmental assessment is currently underway by PGV as the company is grading the land for the future equipment. The company will continue to provide updates on the project during quarterly meetings.",

This work also complements [the geothermal action plan](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/france-publishes-action-plan-to-accelerate-geothermal-development/) published by the French government in 2023, aiming at quadrupling the rate of deployment of deep geothermal projects by 2035. Over the next ten years, the government targets: * 10 TWh of heat from surface geothermal energy (T < 30 °C, depth < 200 meters) in 2030, then 15-18 TWh by 2035 * 6 TWh of heat from deep geothermal energy (30 °C < T < 200 °C, 400 meters < depth < 3000 meters) in 2030, then 8-10 TWh by 2035 The seven measures as detailed by the document are as follows: * Launch a call for expressions of interest from local authorities in 2026 to characterize deep geothermal resources in little-known areas in metropolitan France * Reduce the confidentiality periods for certain data relating to geothermal exploration by 2026 to disseminate subsurface knowledge and de-risk projects * Simplify the procedures applicable to certain surface geothermal projects by raising the maximum output threshold of “geothermal energy of minimal importance” to 2 MW in the fall of 2025 * Define the conditions under which heat storage installation will be able to benefit from “geothermal energy of minimal importance” projects * By the end of 2025, prepare a decree relating to methods of applying working hours on deep geothermal drilling sites * Carry out awareness-raising and communications actions on the effectiveness and exemplary nature of geothermal energy among communities * Finalize the development of the network of regional geothermal specialist facilitators to cover the entire metropolitan area by 2026 The first seven acceleration measures presented are intended to be integrated into the national action plan, which will be subject to biannual monitoring from autumn 2025.",

    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "16 May 2025",
    "content": "The story of using geothermal steam for drying of coffee beans in Kamojang, Indonesia is an example of models exploring other applications of geothermal energy. At more than 40 years of operations, the Kamojang geothermal production field of [PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy](https://www.pge.pertamina.com/) (PGEO) in West Java is one of the most important geothermal sites of Indonesia. It is also a site of innovation for geothermal utilization, as it is the birthplace of the world’s [first coffee processed using geothermal steam.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-heat-being-used-for-coffee-processing-in-indonesia/) Muhammad Ramdhan Reza Nurfadilah, also known as Mang Deden, is the pioneer behind this innovation. Since 2023, Deden, together with local entrepreneurs, has been harnessing the natural wealth of his hometown with support from PGEO. Before coming up with the innovative process, Deden had already been running a coffee business since 2015. With a café that was a popular gathering place for locals and PGE employees to relax and share stories, Deden began to establish a good relationship with the employees of PGE Kamojang Area. This closeness developed through casual conversations often filled with discussions about coffee, from the production process to the potential for developing local coffee. These discussions eventually evolved into a concrete idea when PGEO expressed interest in starting a coffee development program, which Deden enthusiastically welcomed. _“At that time, I considered the idea to be a challenge. I saw geothermal potential as an opportunity to provide solutions to various problems faced by conventional coffee producers,”_ he explained. Together with PGEO, Deden conducted intensive research to identify the fermentation techniques best suited to the geothermal characteristics used in coffee processing. _“I conducted fermentation research for almost a year. From more than 20 processes we tried, we finally found three that best fit the characteristics of the drying process,”_ he said. Following the research, Deden began producing coffee using Arabica beans grown in the highlands of Kamojang, at an altitude of around 1,500 meters above sea level. He then empowered local coffee entrepreneurs to build a more efficient business ecosystem through the use of _‘Geothermal Dry House’_ technology, which utilizes geothermal steam from PGEO’s Kamojang operations as a substitute for sunlight. This allowed for a more stable, hygienic, and high-quality drying process. From a business perspective, this technology excels by accelerating the drying time up to threefold. This translates lower operational costs and increased production capacity without additional time or expenses. _“This technology also minimizes the risk of bacterial contamination from outside sources. That way, the bacteria that affect the process only come from the fermentation before drying. In terms of taste, the end result is more fruity, with a stronger aroma, and a smoother texture compared to coffee processed conventionally,”_ he explained. Deden currently manages [Geothermal Coffee Process](https://www.instagram.com/gcp.idn/) (GCP) as Managing aDirector, where he collaborates with PGEO to empower coffee farmers in Kamojang. GCP processes post-harvest coffee beans into green beans, partnering with over 80 farmers and absorbing 20 tons of coffee last season. Moving forward, Deden aims to develop GCP into an integrated business that delivers a broader social and economic impact for the community. In the first year of its launch, Deden mentioned that there were parties from abroad interested in replicating this system._“We felt it was important to patent it immediately. Rather than having this concept adopted by external parties first, it’s better for us to develop it domestically. We want the Indonesian people, especially in coffee-producing areas close to geothermal sources, to be the first to implement a similar concept,”_ Deden hoped. This is what fueled Deden’s spirit to introduce geothermal coffee as an original Indonesian innovation to the global stage. His efforts paid off, as GCP succeeded in penetrating international markets with exports to Japan. This year, the company aims to expand exports to Europe. _“From the beginning, my friends at PGE Kamojang have always believed in me and encouraged me to keep trying new things. This collaboration is not just about inventing the world’s first geothermal coffee, but also about opening doors for us, local entrepreneurs, to grow, learn, and dream bigger. We are increasingly experiencing the benefits of geothermal energy, not just as a source of electricity in our homes, but also as a door that opens up opportunities for a better life,”_ he concluded. With a background as a vocational high school graduate in pharmacy, Deden is now exploring the opportunity to pursue a bachelor’s degree through a scholarship program from PGEO. He has chosen to major in business management, aiming to realize his dream of building a sustainable enterprise.",

    "content": "The first supercritical geothermal exploration well in New Zealand will be drilled at a site within the Rotokawa Geothermal Reservoir in the Taupo Volcanic Zone. A site within the Rotokawa Geothermal Reservoir in the Taupo Volcanic Zone has been selected for New Zealand’s first supercritical geothermal exploration well. A series of studies and preparatory work will be done, and drilling is expected to begin in 18-24 months. The site in Rotokawa was selected following extensive geological and geophysical studies done by[ Earth Sciences New Zealand](https://www.earthsciences.nz/home), and risk assessment to confirm its sustainability. An important stakeholder for this initiative is [Tauhara North No.2 Trust](https://tauharano2.co.nz/), which is the guardian of the Rotokawa geothermal resources and have deep cultural and historical connection to the area. The locals have used the geothermal resources in the region for cooking, bathing, and healing for generations. Thus, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Tauhara North No.2 Trust, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, and Mercury NZ which operates the Rotokawa geothermal power station, to explore the potential of supercritical geothermal energy at the site. Earth Sciences NZ is contributing technical and scientific expertise. The first phases of the project include pre-feasibility work studies, well design, development of a business case and validation of the preferred site. As part of the work, a multi-disciplinary design team comprising local and international experts, is also being assembled to lead work across regulatory approvals, design, risk assessment, geoscientific modelling, engineering, procurement, drilling and asset management. The Coalition Government [has committed up to $60 million](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-zealand-to-invest-60-million-on-supercritical-geothermal-research/) from the Regional Infrastructure Fund to support the development of the first well, with plans for two additional wells as part of a broader programme. Very recently, the research initiative [secured a further $10 million](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/supercritical-geothermal-research-receives-10-million-from-new-zealand-endeavor-fund/) from the New Zealand Endeavor Fund. _“This early-stage exploration could help prove the viability of supercritical geothermal energy, which has the potential to deliver several times the power output of conventional geothermal wells. This groundbreaking work could be a game changer for securing New Zealand’s future energy needs,”_ said Regional Development Minister Shane Jones. _“Drilling into supercritical zones means going 1km-3km deeper into the Earth and managing higher pressures and temperatures than current conventional generation. This is one of the most technically demanding frontiers in geothermal technologies and science,”_ the Minister further added.",

    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "1 Sep 2025",
    "content": "QHeat and Exel Composites have developed a composite pipe material that improves borehole energy efficiency in geothermal energy and storage operations. A composite pipe material, co-created by Finnish companies [QHeat](https://www.qheat.com/) and [Exel Composites](https://exelcomposites.com/), has been shown to improve borehole energy efficiency by 10% at one QHeat’s geothermal wells at the site of the Lounavoima waste-to-energy plant. The glass fiber reinforced polymer (GRFP) material was proven to be suitable to the pressure and temperature conditions of underground applications, while providing the insulating capacity to improve energy efficiency in heat transfer. The energy saved by improving the plant’s storage efficiency equates to the heating requirements of 700 detached houses per year. _“The composite collector pipes improved the energy production and storage capacity of Lounavoima’s borehole by nearly 10 percent compared to the previous solution,”_ said QHeat CEO Erika Salmenvaara. The tailored composite collector pipes were developed to meet the Lounavoima plant’s specific needs, while also focusing on durability, sustainability, and recyclability. The collector pipes needed to withstand their own weight two kilometers underground, while also insulating heat to ensure energy isn’t lost during transfer. Exel’s composite solution rose to the occasion, being metal-free, light-weight, optimized for flow and insulation, and recyclable. The choice of fiberglass might seem unconventional compared to acid-resistant steel or plastics. However, traditional materials weren’t a good fit for this case: metals conduct heat, and plastic lacks the mechanical strength required at such depths. Composite materials can be applied well beyond geothermal energy, in areas such as wind and solar power, where their performance characteristics – lightness, insulation, corrosion resistance and long lifetime – deliver major benefits. This supports, among others, industries driving the green transition. The collaboration between the two parties was described as a “natural fit.” Exel Composites’ R&D department worked closely with QHeat’s engineers to tailor the composite tubes to the job’s specific environmental and performance requirements. The two teams went through several iterations, optimizing for sizing, connection methods, and thermal insulation vs mechanical strength trade-offs. Exel designed and manufactured the collector pipes, which QHeat installed using specialized tools While QHeat owns the solution and patent for the geothermal well technology, Exel’s R&D team and decades of composites expertise played a crucial part in the co-creation project. Both parties were equally impressed by each other’s expertise. _“We got to work ambitiously and openly on a product that has the potential to launch us into new business areas and markets. We could demonstrate that the composite pipes have an estimated 50-year lifecycle and can be responsibly disposed of at the end of it,”_ said Pertti Kainu, Product Business Owner at Exel Composites. The collector pipe project showcases how Finnish engineering and collaboration can accelerate the green transition. Designed, tested, and manufactured entirely in Finland, the Lounavoima collector pipes reflect both companies’ roots, but their sights [are set firmly on international growth](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/finnish-geothermal-company-targets-international-expansion/). QHeat is expanding in the Nordics and EU, while Exel’s international factories support smooth collaboration across markets. _“We’re taking QHeat’s thermal wells abroad, and Exel can bring their product development professionals into our international projects,”_ commented Salmenvaara.",

    "author": "Alexander Richter",
    "date": "7 May 2025",
    "content": "A new paper by Prof. Gabriel Eckstein of Texas A&M University School of Law explores legal uncertainties in geothermal energy ownership, with major implications for project development and investment. A new scholarly article by [Professor Gabriel Eckstein of Texas A&M University School of Law](https://www.law.tamu.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/gabriel-eckstein.html) is stirring debate in the geothermal sector, raising critical questions about who owns the heat beneath our feet – and how the absence of clear legal ownership could hinder geothermal development in the United States. Titled “[Who Owns Heat? Property Rights in Geothermal Energy](https://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Eckstein.pdf)”, the article, published in the University of Illinois Law Review, dives into the complex legal status of geothermal heat as a non-tangible, incorporeal natural resource. While landowners typically hold rights to oil, gas, and water beneath their property, Eckstein argues that the law remains largely unsettled when it comes to thermal energy. _“Geothermal energy is not a substance like water or minerals—it’s a condition or characteristic of subsurface formations,”_ Eckstein writes. “Without clear rules of ownership, the legal foundation for investing in geothermal remains shaky.” The article examines both federal and state law, showing how different U.S. states classify and regulate geothermal resources in inconsistent ways – some treating it as a mineral, others as water, and a few as a sui generis resource. It also reviews private property theories, tort doctrines like trespass and nuisance, and the rule of capture – suggesting that outdated legal frameworks may not match the realities of subsurface heat extraction. At the heart of the paper is a call for legal clarity. Eckstein argues that defining property rights in geothermal energy – whether private, public, or common – could unlock greater investment, improve regulatory consistency, and help accelerate the deployment of this underutilized baseload renewable energy source. Read the full paper here: [Who Owns Heat? Property Rights in Geothermal Energy – University of Illinois Law Review](https://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Eckstein.pdf) As the U.S. ramps up interest in geothermal, particularly through enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) and direct use heating applications, this legal scholarship could serve as a catalyst for state and federal policy reform—aimed at reducing risk and encouraging development.

    "content": "A recent webinar by the DeepU project examines the state of geothermal deep drilling technologies and showcased the potential of laser drilling. Traditional drilling methods primarily rely on mechanical force, utilising a rotatory system to grind and crush rock – a process that can be both time-consuming and costly. To overcome these limitations, the[ **DeepU project**](https://www.deepu.eu/) introduces an innovative drilling technology that harnesses the _power of laser energy combined with cryogenic gas_ , enabling rock fracturing with unprecedented speed and precision. The overall aim of **DeepU** is to develop a deep (>4 km), closed-loop, vitrified, waterproof, non-cracked U-tube heat exchanger by integrating laser and cryogenic gas into a single cutting-edge drilling solution. The proposed technology is being tested at the laboratory scale in different rock types to verify its ability to liquefy and vitrify rock, ensuring the borehole is ready for heat exchange immediately after drilling. Laboratory demonstrations provide crucial data to assess the technological, environmental and economic sustainability of the proposed solution, while also defining its potential and commercial viability. The high-risk innovation presented in DeepU has the potential to make geothermal energy system accessible everywhere in a targeted and demand-oriented manner, offering a complementary approach and an alternative solution to traditional energy storage and production, decentralising the power supply also in areas where this is currently deemed uneconomic. DeepU has been funded by the European Commission under the EIC Pathfinder Programme (G.A. 101046937) as part of Horizon Europe. Eng. Luc Pockelé coordinates the project from the RED srl in collaboration with partners from four countries: the University of Padua (Italy), Prevent GmbH (Germany), Fraunhofer IAPT (Germany), GeoServ (Ireland), The Wroclaw University of Science and Technology (Poland), and the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche IGG (Italy). The project will run until October 2025. Just recently, the DeepU project held a webinar titled **“Does deep drilling need a revolution?”** The webinar brought together experts and stakeholders to examine the current state of [deep drilling](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-drilling-in-szaflary-poland-terminates-at-6103-2-meters-depth/) technologies while initiating a discussion on the breakthroughs necessary to access ultra-deep geothermal resources. Central to the conversation was the pioneering technology proposed by DeepU – its approach combines high-power lasers and cryogenic gas to penetrate the most challenging rock formations. The project partners showcased cutting-edge, innovative drilling technologies while emphasizing the advantages of non-mechanical drilling. They shared significant findings from the DeepU project that demonstrate, on a laboratory level, the potential of laser drilling technology to address the limitations of conventional methods. The research investigates how lasers interact with rock, revealing that thermal spallation, melting, and vaporization occur simultaneously, albeit with varying intensities based on rock type, power density, and irradiation duration. Notably, thermal spallation is the most promising to produce usable diameter wells, with drilling rates ranging from 5 to 15 meters per hour. The team has selected supercritical nitrogen as the flushing medium for deep borehole drilling due to its thermodynamic properties and effectiveness in removing cuttings. They developed a numerical model to determine the necessary pressure and flow rates for different borehole depths, which is being validated through a dedicated test rig. The proposed system involves storing liquid nitrogen, compressing it to high pressures (up to 350 bars), and delivering it down the borehole through a specially designed channel with vacuum insulation. Among the challenges discussed regarding the technology is the need for integration with existing drilling equipment and practices. **[The presentations and the recording of the webinar are available on the project website.](https://www.deepu.eu/index.php/events/)**",

    "content": "Drilling of the first exploration well at the Sveifluháls area in Krýsuvík, Iceland has been completed with promising initial results. Drilling in Krýsuvík [started in April 2025](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/hs-orka-commences-geothermal-exploration-drilling-at-krysuvik-iceland/). Drilling operations are being done by [Iceland Drilling](https://www.jardboranir.is/), using the Odin electric drill rig. In this first exploration drilling, a slightly shallower well was drilled than originally 2750 meters depth planned. Well KR-10 was drilled to a TVD of 2200 meters with a MD of 2600 meters. The results of the first drilling indicate high geothermal potential in the area, although it is too early to say whether it will be exploited. However, these initial results raise hopes that the area can be used for geothermal exploitation in the near future. The well is now allowed to heat up so that further testing can be done to evaluate the temperature, pressure, and volume of geothermal fluid for further decision-making. Exploration drilling in Sveifluháls is based on the agreement signed between the Hafnarfjörður Municipality and HS Orka in June 2024 in connection with the potential utilization of geothermal resources in Krýsuvík. The agreement aims to explore the possibility of harnessing geothermal energy and extracting groundwater in the land of Krýsuvík in an economical and environmentally friendly manner, in parallel with the development of a resource park where further utilization of process streams can take place. Preparation for drilling of the next well, KR-11, is already ongoing. It is planned in the area just north of Bleikhól and planning changes for the well are currently being made in collaboration with Hafnarfjörður Municipality. The geothermal development in Krýsuvík is expected to provide security to the supply of hot water in the Suðurnes region., as the area currently predominantly relies on supply from the Nesjavellir hydroelectric power plant and the Hellisheidi hydroelectric power plant in the Hengil area. The Krýsuvík area has so far been highly regarded as a geothermal area for energy production. There are hopes that it will produce hot water for Hafnarfjörður and the capital region, as well as electricity for the national grid.",

    "title": "Interview – Ensuring geothermal representation in the EU policy agenda",
    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "8 Sep 2025",
    "content": "In this interview, Malte Nyenhuis of Innargi discusses the opportunities for geothermal advocacy at the EU level and the importance of industry representation. _After many years being somewhat overlooked at EU level, the large potential of geothermal energy has started to be recognised by policymakers in Brussels. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen highlighting geothermal at the World Economic Forum in Davos and the commitment of EU Energy Commissioner Dan Jørgensen to come forward with a Geothermal Action Plan are clear signs._ _This development is the result of an increased awareness among many players in the sector that geothermal must step up its policy work at EU level if it wants to be seen at equal footing with other renewables. To learn more about the state of EU policies on geothermal and what it will take for lobbying efforts to create tangible results, we spoke with Malte Nyenhuis, Head of EU Affairs at[ Innargi](https://innargi.com/de/)._ When I joined Innargi almost two years ago, a political momentum in favour of geothermal was starting to build up. Consequently, the European Parliament, the European Council of the Region, the European Economic and Social Committee and the EU Council in 2024 all [called on the incoming European Commission to present a Geothermal EU Action Plan](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/european-council-calls-on-measures-for-the-faster-deployment-of-geothermal/) – the first ever EU policy document focused on geothermal – alongside strategies on Heating & Cooling and Electrification. This momentum was to a large extent triggered by the changing energy policy context: While fighting climate change remains high on the EU agenda, energy security as well as stable and affordable prices have become the top priorities. Policymakers across political parties have started to understand that geothermal energy as a local renewable and 24/7 available source can significantly contribute to all three goals. However, the first challenge is to keep this positive momentum throughout 2025. It is mainly a year of strategies and agenda setting for the new European Commission and European Parliament. Many other stakeholders are trying to push their issue in the political narrative leading up to the legislative proposals for the so-called “post-2030 framework” which should ensure that the EU will meet its 2040 climate target currently under discussion. As geothermal we must make sure that we are seen as indispensable part of the solution across Europe. And secondly, while it is very positive that an EU Geothermal Action Plan has been announced, it is not yet carved in stone that it will be a fully fledged document in its own right or rather a footnote to the Heating & Cooling and Electrification strategies. The geothermal sector needs to translate it’s often technical and academic expertise into concrete policy messages and proposals which fit the current political debates about EU’s competitiveness and security while continue to increase its visibility in Brussels. Overall, the biggest driver for the large-scale uptake of geothermal energy are the EU climate and renewable targets which require the stepwise phase-out of fossil fuels in district heating. This is complemented by country-specific circumstances. In Denmark, for example there is an increasing awareness of the negative implications of biomass, e.g. import dependencies, price variability and questions regarding its sustainability. [With our projects in Poland,](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/innargi-and-veolia-group-partner-for-geothermal-heating-in-lodz-poland/) we understand that using the countries own resource and air quality improvements rank very high. However, despite the huge potential in many European cities to replace fossil fuels in the existing district heating system or to newly connect customers with individual oil and gas boilers like [our project with Vestforbrænding will do in Greater Copenhagen](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/agreement-signed-to-deliver-geothermal-for-district-heating-in-greater-copenhagen-denmark/), barriers remain that also EU can help to overcome. In all our markets we experience very high public acceptance based on early on and open communication with local stakeholders and citizens. At the same time, permitting procedures and timelines differ a lot within but also between countries. This is partly due to a lack of experience with geothermal projects, different national mining laws that were often not made with geothermal in mind with a risk of different interpretation, and EU legislation which is handled differently e.g. on the environmental impact assessment. Political support from the EU level is a helpful first step to make the national and local decision makers more aware of geothermal. More could be done at EU level with regard to easier access to subsurface data as a key tool for de-risking investments, guidelines and possible geothermal-specific rules for permitting and by opening and better recognising geothermal and the modernisation and expansion of district heating in the various EU funding tools. Already in 2019, when Ursula von der Leyen presented the EU Green Deal, it was about fighting climate change by transforming the EU into a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. As described above and looking at the Draghi report, this objective has become even more important even though some of the wording has changed. For geothermal to be part of this, it means that the sector needs to bring across its relevance across the EU as well as its business case in terms of attracting private investments and contributing to EU’s policy objectives. That is why Innargi has hired me as Brussels representative: To increase the visibility and to make sure that developers and operators have a seat at the policy table. The good thing is that geothermal is very versatile: It can be shallow or deep, and it has a lot of applications from electricity and heating to storage and critical raw materials. However, this often results in fragmented and not necessarily very loud voices. To be heard and give concise input to EU policy makers, a strong and more consolidated voice of the sector building on concrete project and business experience is needed. The[ European Geothermal Energy Council](https://www.egec.org/) (EGEC) as the long-standing and recognised association is well placed to live up to this task. However, speaking from my experience with other major EU energy associations this requires a structured integration and coordination of members views. That’s because the European Commission, when drafting policy documents or legislation, wants very concrete input based on the real-life experience from companies. Compared to the utilities sector and other renewables, there are hardly any larger or even big players active in geothermal. And if so, it is very small part of their overall business if we look e.g. at Engie or EnBW. That is why Innargi has been active in Brussels since very early on to bring market knowledge as well as technical and economic feasibility insights to the table. And that is why EGEC needs to have a strong voice that includes the project implementation and business-driven perspectives. Politics depends on a lot of external factors, and you never know what might suddenly happen which will impact the policy agenda. This is what I like a lot about my job. But politics also goes in circles, people come and go as do issues. For this reason, we constantly must educate people about geothermal and to push for it to be on the agenda. Another key challenge is the link between Brussels and what happens in the different markets. Talking about faster permitting at EU level is one thing – everyone likes that. But how can we actually best navigate and work with the different national interpretations of EU rules (e.g., on state aid and permitting)? This is another important role of EGEC, to facilitate and foster the exchange and mutual learning of the different companies active in Europe. The Energy Council conclusions from the end of last year and the initiatives in many EU Member States and regions show the growing openness and political will to advance geothermal energy There is no doubt that the announced EU Geothermal Action plan together with the Heating & Cooling and Electrification Strategies are a major opportunity to accelerate and scale-up geothermal across Europe. At the same time, it is important that the EU energy and climate policy framework for the time after 2030 gives a strong signal to market players and local decision-makers for investments in geothermal. The starting point is the adoption of an EU climate target for 2040 followed by a renewables target and measures to achieve them. Geothermal has a lot to offer for EU’s and national overall policy objectives. For policymakers to understand and be aware, concrete proposals based on close collaboration by everyone in the sector as well as progress on concrete projects all over Europe is needed. At this pivotal moment, stronger structures and voices in Brussels are key – and EGEC is central to that effort. _For a wider perspective of the current state of geothermal in Europe, including research, projects, and policy support, make sure to[register for the upcoming European Geothermal Congress](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/registration-now-open-for-the-2025-european-geothermal-congress/), taking place in Zurich, Switzerland on 6-10 October 2025._ Tags SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE * Follow Think GeoEnergy * [About Us](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/about/) * [Terms & Condition](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/about/terms-conditions/) * [Privacy Policy](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/about/privacy-policy/) * [Advertisement](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/advertisement/) * [Our Advertisers](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/our-advertisers/) * [Support](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/support-us/) * [ENGLISH](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/) * [EN ESPAÑOL](http://www.piensageotermia.com/) * [IN TURKISH](http://www.jeotermalhaberler.com/) All rights reserved. © ThinkGeoEnergy ehf. 2025 We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The prize recognizes young scientists working on application-oriented issues in deep and medium-depth geothermal energy. The focus is particularly on projects with a geographical connection to the Bavarian Molasse Basin and/or the Upper Rhine Graben – two regions that offer enormous geological potential for the utilization of deep geothermal energy sources The Christian Hecht Prize is awarded by a panel of experts from academia and industry. In addition to free access to the Praxisforum Geothermie.Bayern, the winner will receive cash prize money and the opportunity to present their work to a distinguished audience from the geothermal industry at the awards ceremony on the day of the conference, October 23, 2025. In addition, the two best submissions will be offered the opportunity to present their research results to a wider audience in an international webinar Last year, Chan-Neng Hsu was awarded a prize for his master’s thesis entitled _“Development of a Workflow for Migrating a Reservoir Model from Petrel/Eclipse to the MOOSE Framework/GOLEM Using a Geothermal Plant of the Munich Municipal Utilities (SWM) as an Example_ .” The work focuses on the simulation of geothermal energy development in the greater Munich area. Hsu develops an innovative approach for transferring existing models into a new simulation environment. By skillfully combining the strengths of both software systems, a seamless and efficient workflow has been established – a significant contribution to the further development of geothermal applications in urban areas. In 2023, [Christopher Schifflechner won the Christian Hecht Prize.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-projects-and-research-in-bavaria-lauded-in-praxisforum-event/) His doctoral thesis at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) is titled _“Efficient and flexible geothermal systems for the joint provision of electricity, heat, and cooling_ .” In it, he investigated the growing importance of environmentally friendly cooling using sorption chillers in combination with deep geothermal energy. His work not only analyzed the technical challenges of integrating them into combined energy supply systems but also provided a sound thermo-economic evaluation of these pioneering concepts. In 2022, the award went to Felix Schölderle for his dissertation _“Fiber optic monitoring in a deep geothermal production well in the Upper Jurassic aquifer in southern Germany_ .” The work, conducted at the Chair of Hydrogeology at TUM, accompanied the installation of a fiber optic cable in a deep geothermal well. The innovative monitoring enabled the acquisition of comprehensive data under various operating conditions—from shutdown to injection to production—and thus makes a significant contribution to a better understanding of geothermal processes in deep aquifers. In 2021, the prize was shared – a testament to the exceptional quality of the submitted work. Matthäus Irl (TUM) impressed with his research on the analysis and optimization of the operation of hydrothermal deep geothermal plants with electricity and heat utilization. Sebastian Eyerer, also from TUM, developed a promising experimental approach to improve the ORC cycle through the targeted investigation of working fluids and plant architecture – an important step towards more efficient geothermal power plants.",

    "content": "Seismic surveys done in large cities in Denmark have highlighted the flexibility of the technology, facilitating rapid data gathering and project development. Geothermal energy is playing a crucial role in decarbonizing district heating. At the forefront of this transition is [Innargi](https://innargi.com/de/), a leading European geothermal developer dedicated to decarbonising heat—one community at a time. With the economics of geothermal energy demanding a swift transition from design to heat production, where tighter budgets necessitate faster project timelines, Innargi is setting a new benchmark for this with two large-scale geothermal projects in the city center of Aarhus and [North of Copenhagen.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/innargi-enters-framework-agreement-for-geothermal-district-heating-in-copenhagen-denmark/) Impressively, [their first geothermal plant in Aarhus](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/construction-to-begin-at-innargis-geothermal-heating-plant-in-aarhus-denmark/) is planned to deliver its first heat in September 2025, just 26 months after the seismic acquisition ended—showcasing the speed and efficiency needed to make geothermal a scalable and impactful clean energy solution. Once completed, these projects will collectively deliver over 130 MW of heating through 19 geothermal wells, reducing CO2 emissions by more than 165,000 tonnes annually. Emil Stürup-Toft, Lead Geoscientist at Innargi, and Claudio Strobbia, Chief Research Scientist and CEO of [RealTimeSeismic](https://realtimeseismic.com/) (RTS), shared their insights on these pivotal geothermal exploration campaigns, showcasing what it takes to image the subsurface and scale geothermal energy to this level in two of Denmark’s largest cities. _“Before acquiring seismic data, we were operating with limited subsurface knowledge in Copenhagen. We knew geothermal potential existed—thanks to a well drilled 25 years ago that had performed beyond expectations —but we lacked certainty about the extent of the geothermal system. Seismic wasn’t a deciding factor in whether to pursue the project, but rather a crucial tool to confirm our geological model.”_ Emil explained. _“We needed to verify whether the productive system extended far enough north and south, as we had hoped. We also knew a basin-bounding fault ran through the center of Copenhagen, but we required precise imaging of its location, as this fault significantly influences geothermal potential on the city’s eastern and western sides._ _“Seismic data proved invaluable in identifying areas with geothermal potential and refining our understanding of the system’s extent. A positive surprise was that the system stretched even farther than expected, both north and south, reinforcing confidence in our development plans._ Emil also commented on the need for seismic in Aarhus:_“In Aarhus, the seismic survey played a critical role in refining our drilling strategy within the pre-selected area for geothermal development. With the site already contracted, the data was essential for pinpointing the most suitable drilling locations, ensuring optimal well placement, and minimizing geological risks._ _“The seismic data helped us avoid potential hazards, ensuring we didn’t accidentally drill into a fault, which could have had undesirable consequences, ranging from increased operational costs and reduced reservoir efficiency to potential loss of well integrity.”_ _“In the most densely populated areas of Denmark, in the height of summer, where tourism activity added to the complexity of our operations, we placed seismic receiver nodes across the city centres, including in front of landmarks like Tivoli Park and the Danish Parliament,”_ explained Emil. _“It was one of the most challenging environments you can imagine for good quality seismic acquisition.”_ Securing approvals and gaining buy-in from local stakeholders before the survey began was relatively seamless, thanks to the proactive communication strategy applied, the modern technology used during the survey, and their flexible approach to survey design and acquisition operations. To address any public concerns, Innargi leveraged TV, radio, and newspapers to inform the public, reassure them about how minimally invasive the survey would be, and emphasize the long-term benefits of clean heating that would be available to them in just a few years. This transparent approach led to minimal concerns from the public during the acquisition phase. The use of [STRYDE](https://stryde.io/)’s miniature nodal seismic technology allowed RTS to record seismic data discreetly, positioning the seismic nodes along streets, in bushes, and next to trees, hidden away from the public where possible. Nodes were clearly marked with notes explaining the survey, and amazingly, less than 1% of them were tampered with. To further minimize disruption, Innargi reduced source efforts near historic and vulnerable buildings and conducted operations at night, ensuring minimal disturbance to the local community. As a result, the survey was virtually invisible to most passersby or local residents. The only indication that a survey was taking place was when the Vibroseis trucks passed quickly through the streets at night for the source operations. _“We were pleasantly surprised by how few nodes were tampered with,”_ Emil noted._“People were curious but generally respectful. Some even mailed back nodes they had picked up!”_ _“The ability to deploy a dense seismic node network without disrupting road traffic or daily life in the city was crucial.”_ said Claudio Strobbia from RTS. _“We leveraged our fleet of STRYDE nodes to acquire the data efficiently.”_ Thanks to the compact size and autonomous functionality of these nodes, RTS was able to deploy a high-density array with just 10 meters between each node, all while avoiding additional costs. This dense array, combined with nighttime operations to minimize anthropogenic noise interference, resulted in data quality that exceeded expectations. _“In our experience, urban environments are notoriously challenging for seismic acquisition, but the results we obtained on these two surveys were exceptional. The combination of a dense receiver grid, long offsets, and optimized source effort enabled us to produce highly accurate subsurface images.”_ added Claudio. Once the data was acquired, RTS processed it with exceptional speed, delivering high-resolution seismic images for Innargi in record time. These insights played a crucial role in refining the geological model, mapping fault lines, and pinpointing the most promising locations for geothermal wells. RTS migrated images just hours after acquisition to conduct initial checks, with full processing completed within weeks. For the Copenhagen survey, operations wrapped up mid-June, and by mid-July, Emil, and his team were already reviewing the initial data, with the final processed versions and report completed by August. RTS’s approach contrasts sharply with traditional, larger processing firms, where the process is often found to be slower. _“Working with RTS, I experienced a highly interactive and tailored service, ensuring that queries were resolved quickly, rather than waiting for weeks on end to see results.”_ Emil commented. The success of these seismic campaigns has already translated into real-world impact. In Aarhus, Innargi’s first geothermal facility, informed by the seismic survey, is set to begin producing heat in September 2025. In Copenhagen, the data has guided site selection, which will ensure that future geothermal wells are optimally placed for maximum efficiency and longevity. _“This was a hugely rewarding project,”_ Emil reflected. _“Seeing something that started as an idea on paper transform into a fully operational geothermal plant is incredibly exciting.”_ The success of these projects highlights the transformative impact of full transparency with local communities, adaptable survey design and operations, autonomous seismic technology, and advanced data processing in urban geothermal exploration. One of the most critical factors affecting data integrity is shot point gaps. _“In urban environments like Copenhagen and Aarhus, access constraints, road bends, and infrastructure limitations made it challenging to achieve consistent shot point coverage. While missing a few nodes in a dense receiver layout is manageable through regularisation, larger gaps in shot points are much harder to compensate for, making it essential to minimize them wherever possible.”_ said Claudio. _“Looking back on how we could have further improved efficiency, reducing source effort and deploying two smaller fleets simultaneously could have improved shot point coverage while increasing acquisition speed and minimizing disruptions. While long offsets can provide valuable data, a 6 km offset was found to be sufficient for these geothermal targets, as longer distances resulted in diminishing returns,”_ added Claudio. With STRYDE’s innovative nodal technology, RTS’s expert seismic acquisition and processing, and Innargi’s geological expertise and commitment to sustainable energy development, this project serves as a benchmark for future geothermal initiatives in densely populated regions. As Europe moves toward a greener energy future, the success of these Danish projects demonstrates how advanced seismic acquisition is rapidly unlocking new opportunities in geothermal energy, helping cities transition away from fossil fuels and toward a more sustainable future.

This will replace a 60-year-old hydronic heating system with three cost-efficient heat pumps that will add cooling, improve ventilation, and enhance indoor air quality for better occupant health and comfort. This announcement marks the second round of funding for GEGP and GETCO. Last May, the Polis administration also announced [$7.7 million in awards for the GEGP.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/colorado-announces-7-7-million-grant-awards-for-35-geothermal-projects/) Applications for the third GEGP funding round, which is the last planned round of funding for the program, closed March 31.

Geothermal developer [Innargi](https://innargi.com/) has announced that it will now be delivering the target capacity of 110 MW of geothermal heating in the city of Aarhus in Denmark from only three locations, instead of the originally planned seven. The decision was based on the results of the three test wells that[ the company had started back in 2023.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/drilling-starts-for-aarhus-denmark-geothermal-heating-project/) Advancements in heat pump technology and local district heating company [Kredsløb](https://www.kredslob.dk/)’s ongoing efforts to lower temperatures in the district heating grid also make it possible to consolidate the project into fewer plants. The plan is to now establish the heating facilities in Skejbyvej, Bautavej, and Halmstadgade, while the previously proposed plants in Brokvarteret, Bjørnholms Allé, Sumatravej, and Jens Juuls Vej are being excluded. The heating plant in Skejby, which started construction in mid-2024, is expected to start supplying geothermal heat by the autumn of this year. _“Thorough analyses of all three test wells have shown that the northern part of Aarhus_ _is the most suitable for geothermal energy from a subsurface perspective. Therefore, we have agreed with Kredsløb_ _to place the geothermal plants in the northern part of the city,”_ said Sune Birk Kendrup, Project Director at Innargi. Kendrup further added that a consequence of the new plan is that two additional wells will have to be drilled in the Skejby area. This is expected to commence by 2027. Lasse Sørensen, Head of Business Development at Kredsløb, maintains that the plan is still for the whole system to be operational by 2029. At full capacity, the 110 MWth from geothermal will be enough to supply about 20% of the heat demand of Aarhus, thus replacing a substantial volume of wood pellets being burned to generate heat.",

The project will involve drilling two wells, each with a maximum depth of 1,200 meters, on a 4,800-hectare site. Work is planned for 25 days a month, 8 hours a day, year-round. A six-person team will be responsible for the drilling process. The aim is to use the hot water generated in greenhouse farming. If sufficient temperature and flow are achieved, the company aims to implement technological greenhouse projects suitable for soilless agriculture, using geothermal energy. Wells deemed unproductive will be used as reinjection wells, allowing water to be returned to the groundwater. At the end of the study, the quantity, quality, and suitability of the reserve will be assessed, and a decision will be made on whether to proceed to production. In addition to the Armen Energy project, two significant capacity increases and new drilling plans are also on the agenda in the Mahmudiye region: * **Alsera Geothermal Agriculture Food Industry and Trade Inc.** is currently [operating on a 2,225-hectare licensed area within the Ismetpasa neighborhood of Mahmudiye.](https://www.jeotermalhaberler.com/eskisehir-mahmudiyede-jeotermal-sondaj-faaliyetleri-hiz-kazaniyor/) Four new drilling points will be added to the existing 11. The depth of the new wells will be approximately 1,000 meters. The planned greenhouses are projected to have a thermal power output of 15.67 MWe. The project also envisions the construction of approximately 575,000 m² of greenhouses and the creation of 50 jobs. * **Nata Tarim Üretim ve Ticaret A.S.

Local drilling company [Daldrup & Söhne Aktiengesellschaft](https://daldrup.eu/) (Daldrup & Söhne) has been awarded the drilling contract for a doublet to be drilled as part of the planned geothermal project in the town of Geiselbullach in the municipality of Olching in Bavaria, Germany. Construction of the drilling site is set to begin in September, with drilling work scheduled between December and May 2026. The contract awarded to Daldrup & Söhne has a value of about EUR 16.8 million. The project aims to tap into geothermal resources to provide an alternative source for the existing district heating network, which is currently supplied by a waste-to-energy plant. The geothermal project will be headed by [Amperland Thermalwärme GmbH](https://www.amperland-thermalwaerme.de/) (ATW), a subsidiary of [Joint Municipal Company for Waste Management](https://www.gfa-online.com/) (Gemeinsames Unternehmen für Abfallwirtschaft / GfA), the company that currently operates the waste-to-energy plant. The company has secured a grant of EUR 8.8 million from the Federal Government’s Efficient Heating Networks (BEW) program to support the project. With this development, the project seems to be on schedule according to the target start of drilling [declared earlier this year](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geothermal-drilling-at-geiselbullach-germany-to-start-later-this-year/). Under the contract, Daldrup will drill two deflected deep geothermal wells with lengths of roughly 2,430 meters and 3,300 meters at the Geiselbullach cogeneration plant site. Water temperature at this depth is expected to be about 73 °C. If the drilling and well testing results are positive, the company will then apply for a water law permit. The geothermal heating plant can then be operational by early 2027.",

    "content": "During the 2024 French Geothermal Days, the Prime Minister François Bayrou reiterated the government's strong support for the French geothermal sector. French Prime Minister François Bayrou has called on the support of banks to help ease the cost of installation of geothermal heat pumps in France. The statement was made as part of the PM’s speech during the opening of[ the 2025 French Geothermal Days in Biarritz](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/registration-open-french-geothermal-days-19-20-june-205-biarritz-france/), organized by [French Association of Geothermal Professionals](https://www.afpg.asso.fr/) (AFPG). Only one million French homes are equipped with them, with an average installation cost of €20,000, twice that of a gas boiler. The PM cites this as one of the major hurdles to wider adoption of the technology. _“The key factor is purely financial,”_ declared the Prime Minister, _“perhaps through the Caisse des Dépôts or the Banque Publique d’Investissement” (Public Investment Bank).”_ The PM stated this could erase the difference in installation costs. _“If a family is offered, for the same monthly payment but only spread out over a longer period, a heat pump rather than a gas boiler, I am sure that they will make this choice because they will save, in energy costs, the amount of this monthly payment_ ,” he further added. The current government has set a target of replacing half of gas boilers in individual homes with heat pumps within 20 years. The Prime Minister had previously cited geothermal as part of the government’s low-carbon strategy. In 2023, [the French government ](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/france-publishes-action-plan-to-accelerate-geothermal-development/)[launched an action plan](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/france-publishes-action-plan-to-accelerate-geothermal-development/) aimed at quadrupling the rate of deployment of deep geothermal projects by 2035.

In particular, the group welcomes: * **The increase of the regulatory threshold** for surface geothermal projects from 0.5 MW to 2 MW, in order to free up and accelerate projects. * **The attention given to drilling jobs** through the implementation of new training programs, as well as the relaxation of working time regulations on deep geothermal drilling sites. * **The ongoing collaboration with banks** to help individuals spread out the investment cost of a geothermal installation, as a replacement for gas boilers. * **The strengthening of the network of geothermal facilitators** in local territories, essential to raising awareness about the benefits of this still underused energy source. _“These announcements represent a decisive step. This strong signal from public authorities reinforces Arverne Group’s efforts to make geothermal energy a key driver of our energy sovereignty. The challenge now lies in swiftly turning these intentions into action to scale up geothermal solutions across France.”_ said Pierre Brossollet, founder and Chairman & CEO of Arverne Group. While this step marks a turning point, it must be part of a broader trajectory. A second set of announcements is expected in September, particularly regarding financial support. The Arverne Group hopes for: * **The strengthening of the Heat Fund** and the need to secure it over multiple years to provide operators with long-term visibility. * **The implementation of new support mechanisms** such as “Certificats d’Economie d’Energie” (Energy Savings Certificates). * **The alignment of energy taxation** with decarbonization goals, including rebalancing taxes between gas and electricity – an essential condition for the development of geothermal energy.",

    "content": "GeoAlaska has further expanded its geothermal acreage in Augustine Island, Alaska after making successful bids on a recent competitive geothermal lease sale. In addition, effective April 1, 2025, the [Alaska Department of Natural Resources](https://dnr.alaska.gov/) (DNR) converted GeoAlaska’s geothermal prospecting permits covering the southern half of Augustine Island into seven geothermal leases with ten-year terms. These leases secure rights to an additional 10,330 acres, for a total of 22,321 acres at Augustine Island. Founded in May 2020 and majority-owned by Alaskans, GeoAlaska, LLC partnered in 2023 with [Ignis Energy, Inc.](https://ignisenergy.com/) – a Houston-based international geothermal exploration and production company. Augustine Island is in the southwest portion of Cook Inlet, immediately south of the Iniskin Peninsula. GeoAlaska’s geothermal journey on Augustine Island [began when its first prospecting permit was issued](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/company-eyeing-geothermal-development-on-augustine-island-alaska/) by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources in 2022. After conducting[ a gravity and audio-magnetotelluric (AMT) survey in 2023](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geophysical-survey-by-geoalaska-ongoing-in-augustine-island-alaska/), the two-year exploration permit was extended for a third year. This survey was followed by [an expanded magnetotelluric (MT) survey](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/geoalaska-to-do-more-geothermal-exploration-at-augustine-island-alaska/) on Augustine Island in 2024. These subsurface surveys have identified three shallow geothermal reservoir targets and a deeper reservoir target above the island’s magma storage system located about 2 km subsurface. Power modeling based on conservative volumetric and enthalpy models supports a P50 estimate of 224 MWh. Exploratory drilling is the next phase to further de-risk the project and to refine the P50 power model. The map below shows the geothermal tracts in Augustine Island. It was annotated by GeoAlaska to mark tracts awarded to GeoAlaska which includes: AI0010, AI0011, AI0012, AI0019, AI0023, and AI0024. These six tracts surround GeoAlaska’s existing acreage on the southern half of Augustine Island. The ADL numbers printed on the south half of the Island represent two-year geothermal exploration permits that have been fully replaced, effective April 1, 2025, with ten-year geothermal leases issued to GeoAlaska by the State of Alaska Division of Oil & Gas, Department of Natural Resources.",

The round was led by At One Ventures, with additional investments from High-Tech Gründerfonds (HTGF), Gründerfonds Ruhr, Verve Ventures and Siemens Energy Ventures. Factor2 Energy is led by Michael Wechsung, Joerg Strohschein and Felix Boehmer who all worked together at Siemens Energy. There they invented a new, economically superior method to harness geothermal energy by utilizing CO? as the primary working fluid in the geothermal cycle, replacing water or brine. The technology being developed by Factor2 Energy is based on the more favorable thermodynamic properties of [CO2 as a working fluid](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/study-shows-captured-co2-could-help-utilise-geothermal-energy/), allowing it to achieve up to twice the power output compared to water-based systems under similar geological conditions. The technology can be deployed at either natural CO2 Reservoirs or at reservoirs designated for Carbon Capture and Storage. This can also be deployed in shallower and cooler geothermal sites, reducing drilling costs and expanding the range of viable power plant locations. _“These techno economics combine to form a favorable LCOE at sites that would previously have been economically unviable. We are excited to support Factor2 to bring this crucial technology to market to unlock the potential of geothermal as a more prevalent source of green baseload,”_ commented Helen Lin, Partner at At One Ventures. _“Our approach enables emission-free, efficient, and baseload-capable electricity production, which is ideal for traditional oil and gas companies looking to diversify their operating assets,”_ said CEO and co-founder Felix Boehmer. _“And in fact, the entire system leverages proven technologies from the oil and gas sector, with its long history of drilling and geologic expertise.”_",

    "content": "Tests are still ongoing, but early results indicate good reservoir conditions for geothermal use at the DemoCELL site in Ahnsbeck, Lower Saxony, Germany. A geothermal research drilling projects near Ahnsbeck in the Celle district of Lower Saxony, Germany has achieved promising results, indicating very good geothermal potential at this location. This is considered the first successful geothermal drilling in Lower Saxony. The DemoCELL project, a collaboration between the [Georg-August University of Göttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/1.html) and [Baker Hughes](https://www.bakerhughes.com/), aims to investigate whether geothermal resources in the study site can be extracted to supply the surrounding area. The study site is part of a geothermal exploration license area [awarded to Baker Hughes back in 2023](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/baker-hughes-granted-geothermal-exploration-permit-for-ahnsbeck-germany/). The project is part of the exploration strategy of Germany’s [Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy](https://www.bmwk.de/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html) (BMWK) to investigate areas with good potential for future geothermal projects. The borehole has been successful in accessing the geothermal reservoir hosted by the Rhät sandstone at a depth of 2400 to 2500 meters. Production tests are still ongoing, but early results have been described as promising. Dr Oliver Höhn, who oversees the project as part of Baker Hughes, states that over 1000 cubic meters of thermal water have been extracted and that the temperature of the water at the wellhead was at 100 °C. During the test, the researchers measured the pressure and temperature in the reservoir and on the submersible centrifugal pump used. This data will be analyzed to determine the reservoir parameters such as temperature, permeability, and production index or injectivity index. This information will allow the team to evaluate the quantities at which geothermal energy can be extracted from the subsurface. Part of the project is the extraction of drill cores from the Rhät sandstone. Using Baker Hughes’ BETA test drilling rig, the team successfully brought a 100-meter-long core to the surface without any losses. This allows for a detailed investigation of the sandstone to determine characteristics such as permeability and storage capacity. _“We have obtained cores of a very high quality,”_ said Dr Matthias Franz, a member of the Department of Structural Geology and Geothermics at the University of Göttingen._“The average permeability that we measured on the samples is around 832 millidarcy — which would indicate that the Rhaetian sandstone is highly suitable.”_ Tests are still ongoing, but the researchers’ initial assessment is that the 44-meter thick sandstone layer is sufficiently permeable. The data from the tests will provide the basis for the potential utilization of the site. Further research is also planned in other sites in the Greater Celle area. At the end of the project, the research team aims to develop a concept for a demonstration project for medium-depth geothermal utilization.",

    "date": "16 May 2025",
    "content": "KTU scientist Mayur Pal highlights the potential for geothermal development for heating in Lithuania, building on learnings from the failed Klaipeda project. Lithuania has potential for geothermal energy for heating, particularly in the Western region, but investment and political support will be necessary for its development. This is just one of many points that were stated by Professor Mayur Pal, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at [Kaunas University of Technology](https://en.ktu.edu/) (KTU) and Head of the [GeoEnergy Research and Innovation Lab](https://mlab-en.ktu.edu/geo-lab/) at the interdisciplinary prototyping laboratory centre M-Lab. Lithuania has already had some experience in geothermal heat operations with the Klaipeda demonstration plant in the city of Klaipeda on the western region, along the Baltic Sea Coast. Four wells were drilled for the project from 1997 to 1998, each targeting the Lower Devonian sandstone at a depth of 1000 meters. The facility was built in 2000 and supplied heat to an existing district heating network. Technical difficulties were encountered in Klaipeda since the start of operations. Gypsum precipitation was observed, along with a continuous drop in injectivity. The flowrates, both for production and reinjection, were well below the expected figures. Remedial measures were done over the following years, including the drilling of a sidetrack well, chemical treatment, and radial jet drilling. These resulted in only marginal improvements. By 2017, the operator Geoterma shut down operations and declared bankruptcy with over EUR 3 million in debt. Still, the experience in Klaipeda proved that temperatures in the Devonian aquifers were high enough to support heating, albeit they are too low for electricity generation. Pal notes that geothermal resources at depths of 1000-1500 meters in western Lithuania have temperatures of about 45–46°C and are hosted in high-porosity sandstone layers. _“Deeper, at about 2–2.5 thousand metres, other sandstone deposits are found, with temperatures reaching around 96°C. These layers are theoretically more suitable for electricity generation, but their quality depends heavily on the location: in central Lithuania, these deposits have better porosity and permeability, while in western Lithuania, these properties are poorer,”_ Pal further added. Despite the limitations of the geothermal resource, Pal states that Lithuania could become a leader for geothermal in the Baltic region. It is also a strategic option for energy development, as the use of geothermal for heating could reduce the country’s dependence on imported electricity and gas. _“A few hundred MW from Cambrian geothermal systems could offset electricity imports, and Devonian aquifers could replace the use of biomass or gas in district heating networks.”_ _“Geothermal energy could make up 5–10 per cent of the 45 per cent share of renewable energy sources, which is about 50–100 MW from Cambrian systems,”_ he says. The stability, versatility, and ability to provide an uninterrupted supply are some of the unique strengths of geothermal. Even though the developed capacity may be modest, geothermal can provide the base capacity to help balance the fluctuating outputs from solar and wind energy.",

Particularly in cities such as [Munich](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/munich-germany-aims-for-co2-neutral-heating-by-2040-primarily-with-geothermal/) and [Vienna](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-geothermal-atlas-shows-shallow-geothermal-potential-in-vienna-austria/), where deep geothermal energy is accessible and district heating network infrastructure is already available. Given the strong seasonal variation in heat demand under European climate conditions, technologies such as absorption chillers, heat pumps, and heat transformers can be used to optimize geothermal energy utilization and reduce the necessity for other energy sources such as fossil fuels. To increase the annual operating hours of absorption systems, a reversible absorption machine is proposed. This design enables cold production during the summer and enhanced heat extraction from the geothermal source during the winter. In order to demonstrate the reversible concept, an absorption heat pump test rig, which combines the three operating modes, chiller, heat pump, and heat transformer, was designed and is currently put into operation at the Chair of Energy Systems of the Technical University of Munich. This talk explores the application potential of absorption technology in the context of geothermal energy. It provides a concise overview of the different absorption cycles—chiller, heat pump, and heat transformer—and illustrates how these three operating modes can be integrated into a single system. The GeoReACh test rig will be introduced, and the planned experimental scope will be outlined and opened up for discussion. Ludwig Irrgang holds a Bachelor’s Degrees in Physics and in Engineering Science and a Master’s Degree in Energy and Process Engineering from the Technical University of Munich. He is currently a Research Assistant at the TU Munich working on projects related to cooling from geothermal energy, air condensers for ORCs, and integration of heat pumps with geothermal resources.

    "content": "A study by Daniel Dichter examines the advantage of designing a water-based geothermal binary power plant for more efficiently tapping into superhot resources. A new study by Daniel Dichter of [Quaise Energy](https://www.quaise.energy/) provides some valuable insight on the design of a binary geothermal power plant to produce electricity from superhot geothermal systems. More specifically, the study proposes that a water-based binary cycle provides more design flexibility and delivers higher efficiency than a standard hydrocarbon-based binary cycle for production temperatures above 300 °C. The full paper was presented at the [50th Stanford Geothermal Workshop](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/call-for-abstracts-50th-stanford-geothermal-workshop-february-2025/) and can be accessed in full [via this link.](https://pangea.stanford.edu/ERE/pdf/IGAstandard/SGW/2025/Dichter.pdf) Many studies have already been published citing the significant benefits, in terms of power output and efficiency, of tapping into superhot geothermal resources, or those with temperatures at above 375 °C. Considering that most geothermal power plants currently operate at temperatures between 100 to 250 °C, little is yet known about how a geothermal power plant should be designed for much higher temperatures. The study examines the design parameters and efficiency of binary geothermal power plants using different working fluids under a production temperatures of 300 to 350 °C. The standard working fluids are considered in the study (isobutane, butane, isopentane, pentane, cyclopentane), and compared with water. A double-pressure cycle was used for the simulations, as it strikes a balance between higher utilization and lower costs and complexity. The maximum utilization or exergetic efficiency was used as the primary metric in comparing the different scenarios. Comparison of utilization indicates that hydrocarbons generally are better options for binary power plants at temperatures below 240 °C. However, water outperforms butane and pentane at temperatures above 300 °C. As production shifts to become more vapor-dominated, the advantage shifts over to water with only cyclopentane providing comparable utilization numbers. The study presents different power plant design scenarios comparing water and cyclopentane. The conclusion is that the higher critical temperature of water allows for more design flexibility, such as more cycle stages thus resulting in higher utilization. It also had other advantages, such as needing fewer wells, a smaller heat exchanger, and a smaller condenser.",

GENESIS services that can be directly utilized by the public include geothermal survey reports, geothermal digital data, geothermal data statistics, auction information, and research and research results. The WKP auction process through the GENESIS digital platform, which was launched in September 2024, has now been transformed with geoscience data features. This transformation was carried out to further ensure transparency and accountability in the WKP auction process. Business Entities selected as PSPE Implementers will undergo a series of geoscience survey activities, infrastructure development, to drilling exploration wells. If declared successful, they are entitled to be ranked first in the Geothermal Working Area auction and receive incentives in the form of exemption from exploration fees, import facilities, and other privileges. The implementation of PSPE is carried out by the Business Entity for 3 (three) years and can be extended 2 (two) times with each extension being carried out for a maximum of 1 (one) year. Before being appointed as a PSPE Implementer, the Prospective PSPE Implementer is required to place part of the exploration commitment of 5% of the Exploration Commitment of at least USD 10 Million. This exploration commitment is a guarantee for the Government for the implementation of PSPE carried out by the company during the PSPE period. This guarantee needs to be deposited with the hope that the business entity can be more serious in implementing PSPE activities in the field so that it can accelerate the completion of PSPE activities. In the event that the PSPE implementing business entity is unable to carry out at least the drilling of wells during the PSPE period, then part of the commitment will be deducted into non-tax state revenue by the Government, but if the business entity succeeds in carrying out PSPE activities up to drilling at least 1 (one) well during the PSPE period, then the guarantee will be returned along with the interest to the PSPE implementing business entity. The areas offered through the PSPE contest are mostly open areas whose areas have been surveyed initially by the Center for Mineral, Coal, and Geothermal Resources, Geological Agency.",

    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "19 Sep 2025",
    "content": "GEOENERGÍA welcomes the draft Royal Decree on thermal networks and makes three proposals to ensure effective deployment of heating and cooling solutions. This September, the [Spanish Geothermal Association](https://www.geoenergia.es/) (GEOENERGÍA) submitted its proposals to the public information process for the **draft Royal Decree regulating heating and cooling networks and thermal origin guarantees** , promoted by the Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge. GEOENERGÍA highly values the publication of this Draft Royal Decree, as it represents a decisive step in the deployment of heating and cooling networks in Spain and in the recognition of renewable thermal sources, particularly geothermal energy. The draft regulation promoted by the Ministry includes key elements for the development of heating and cooling networks. Among them, it provides the necessary flexibility to facilitate the promotion of fifth-generation networks for the supply of heating and cooling, including a proactive policy for the incorporation of all types of waste heat into the renewable thermal mix. GEOENERGÍA has submitted **three priority proposals** , which it considers essential to achieving an effective and uniform deployment of heating and cooling networks throughout the country: It is proposed to declare heating and cooling networks as services of general interest , on par with other basic utilities such as electricity, telecommunications, hydrocarbons, and water, which have specific sectoral regulations. The creation of this status would provide legal certainty and enable more streamlined and orderly access to the use of public and heritage land, avoiding the need for complex state-owned concession processes, which are limited in scope and ill-suited for these infrastructures. This recognition would facilitate more efficient deployment on an equal footing with other essential utilities, while also reinforcing its strategic role in the energy transition and in reducing external dependence. In addition to the cooperation obligations of waste heat source owners, accompanying measures should be established to incentivize their use by both producers and consumers, provided it is technically and economically feasible. To this end, a system combining incentives and penalties is proposed, considering heat dissipation into the atmosphere as a waste. This measure would contribute to maximizing the use of an available energy resource, reducing energy losses, strengthening the overall efficiency of the system, and generating environmental and economic benefits, aligned with the goals of climate neutrality and the transition toward a more sustainable energy model. It is proposed to make it mandatory for public administrations to contract heat and/or cooling provided by renewable or residual thermal networks, provided that technical and economic conditions allow it. In this way, the administrations would reinforce their exemplary role in the decarbonization of the air conditioning sector, boosting initial demand and helping to ensure the economic viability of the networks in their early stages of development. This measure would foster a framework of stability for developers and operators, encouraging investment, accelerating project deployment, and positioning public institutions as catalysts for change toward a cleaner, more efficient, and more resilient thermal energy system.",

    "date": "18 Jun 2025",
    "content": "A geothermal heating project in Gräfelfing, Germany is now progressing to drilling and construction, albeit now under a 100% municipal-owned framework. The geothermal heating project in Gräfelfing, Germany is now proceeding with the drilling of deep boreholes and the construction of the heating plant and the distribution network. However, it will continue under a different framework, with the municipality taking over the project without a private partner. In 2022, the company [Geothermie Gräfelfing](https://www.geothermie-graefelfing.de/) was founded as a joint venture of Fernwärmenetz Gräfelfing (FWNG, 51%) and Silenos Energy (49%). A technical and economic feasibility study and exploration drilling were completed under the joint venture, prompting the municipality [to give approval for the project to proceed.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/go-ahead-for-planned-geothermal-heat-project-in-grafelfing-germany/) Deep drilling was [initially planned for the 3rd quarter of 2024](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/preparations-begin-for-geothermal-heating-project-at-grafelfing-germany/). The latest update from the municipality states that this has now been pushed to 2025 after the project has secured funding of EUR 50 million from the Federal Funding for Efficient Heat Networks (BEW). The project will now continue to its Phase 2 implementation, but Silenos Energy will no longer be involved. This development comes up because of two factors: * Based on an evaluation of the current framework conditions and financing option, the municipality of Gräfelfing can finance the project more cost-effectively without a privately financed share; * Changes in funding conditions from the Federal Government and the State of Bavaria has made it necessary to make far-reaching adjustments to the corporate and financing structure, and it becomes fundamentally simpler to proceed with the project without the joint venture. Thus, a mutual agreement was reached for Silenos Energy to transfer all its shares to FWNG. Following the transfer of shares, a tender for the drilling and construction work is expected to be announced soon. _“I wish GGK every success in the realization of the geothermal project. As project manager for the past few years, I am convinced that together we have paved the way for the implementation of the geothermal project and that this will create a groundbreaking and, above all, sustainable heat supply for the municipality of Gräfelfing,”_ said Silenos Managing Director Felix Koselleck. _“I am very pleased that years of careful preparatory work have borne fruit and that work is now underway in the foreseeable future. It was a tough job obtaining the crucial information, permits, and funding for such a significant project. A big thank you goes to our partner Silenos Energy for their excellent cooperation and hard work in ensuring the successful completion of Phase 1,”_ added Gräfelfing’s Mayor Peter Köstler.",

The [Croatian Hydrocarbon Agency](https://www.azu.hr/hr-hr) (AZU) has obtained the location permit for a geothermal exploration well to be drilled in the town of Zaprešic in Zagreb County, Croatia. With this development, drilling is now expected to be carried out from December 2025 to February 2026. By September, preparation of the identified drill site near the Novi Drovi landfill will begin. The town will receive funding of about EUR 10.5 million for the project through the measure, “Promoting energy efficiency, district heating and renewable energy sources for the decarbonization of the energy sector” as part of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP). Through this program, the AZU has been allocated a total funding of EUR 50 million for testing and confirming geothermal potential, with the goal of increasing the share of geothermal energy in the district heating sector. In 2024, the AZU signed a contract with CROSCO for the design, procurement of materials and construction of exploratory geothermal wells on a turnkey basis for four locations – Velika Gorica, Zaprešic, Osijek, and Vinkovci. Based on positve findings from geological and geophysical evaluations, the decision was made to drill one exploration well for each of these sites.

    "date": "11 Aug 2025",
    "content": "Preparations are underway for the drilling of a second well in the Graben-Neudorf geothermal project in Germany, at the site of a previously drilled 200 °C well. The geothermal project of [Deutsche ErdWärme](https://deutsche-erdwaerme.de/) in Graben-Neudorf in Baden-Württemberg, Germany is progressing according to plan, with preparations ongoing for the drilling of a second well in 2026. To better understand the potential of the geothermal resource, Deutsche ErdWärme applied for a second injection phase to the Freiburg Mining Authority. Following successful approval, an injection test lasting several weeks is planned for the fourth quarter of 2025. The goal is to validate the reservoir’s sustainable injection capacity and to operationally test operating procedures under real-world conditions. In parallel with the preparations for the injection phase, the second well is already being planned and is scheduled to be drilled soon. All previous findings will be incorporated into the technical and geological planning to advance the project and thus the local heat transition. _“A second drilling cellar is already in place for the well, and planning for the heating plant is well underway,”_ said Rolf Herrmann, Head of Geothermal Engineering for Deutsche Erdwärme. The final use of the geothermal plant—as a combined heat and power plant (CHP) or as a pure heating plant—depends on further tests and infrastructure planning. The planned heat supply for the Bruchsal, Dettenheim, and Bretten region plays a particularly central role in this. State Secretary Dr. Andre Baumann from the Ministry for the Environment, Climate Protection, and Energy recently visited the drilling site in Graben-Neudorf. During the visit, Deutsche ErdWärme presented the next steps in the project’s progress as well as the visualization of the subsurface using 3D modeling and simulation software to better convey geological relationships. The presentation of the 3D geothermal model was a central part of the visit, as this making it possible to visualize the complexity of the subsurface and allow for a new level of transparency for geothermal projects. _“With 3D visualization, we create a better understanding of the geological conditions of geothermal projects and can better involve stakeholders without geological expertise,”_ explained Herrmann. _“Geothermal projects like the one in Graben-Neudorf are a good example of bold progress in the heat transition. They unearth a treasure and help ensure a sustainable and independent energy supply. This will enable us to significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels while simultaneously advancing our climate goals,”_ said Dr. Baumann in support of the project.",

    "title": "How Kenya’s energy policy is driving geothermal development",
    "author": "Alexander Richter",
    "date": "22 Apr 2025",
    "content": "Kenya’s updated energy policy and auction mechanisms are transforming geothermal development. Explore how regulatory reforms are pushing clean energy goals. Kenya stands at a strategic crossroads in its energy transition, with ambitious targets for renewable energy and universal electricity access by 2030. Geothermal energy plays a central role in achieving these goals, and recent policy reforms are proving pivotal in shaping the country’s geothermal future, so a “[Kenya 2024 – Energy Policy Review](https://www.iea.org/reports/kenya-2024)” report released by IEA one week ago. Kenya remains to be the geothermal powerhouse of Africa. As of 2024, geothermal energy accounts for approximately 47% of the country’s electricity generation, making it the largest single source in Kenya’s renewable energy mix. [With 985 MW installed capacity](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/thinkgeoenergys-top-10-geothermal-countries-2024-power/) and an estimated potential of up to 10 GW, geothermal is both a foundation and a frontier for Kenya’s clean energy ambitions. Today, the country ranks no. 6 in the Top 10 of geothermal countries, only about 15 MW shy of joining the 1 GW Geothermal Countries Club. The government’s [Vision 2030](https://vision2030.go.ke/) aims to transition the country into a newly industrializing, middle-income economy, and energy access is a cornerstone of that strategy. Kenya’s target of 100% renewable power generation and universal electricity access by 2030 underlines the importance of geothermal as a stable, dispatchable energy source in a mix increasingly composed of variable renewables like solar and wind. The [Energy Act of 2019](https://kenyalaw.org/kl/fileadmin/pdfdownloads/Acts/2019/EnergyAct__No.1of2019.PDF) remains the cornerstone of Kenya’s energy policy. It provides a comprehensive legal structure for renewable energy development, including geothermal. Key provisions include: * Allocation of undeveloped geothermal resources to the national government. * Exploration licenses valid for two years (renewable), and production licenses valid for up to 30 years. * Royalties structured at 2.5% for the first decade and between 2–5% thereafter. Further, the [Least Cost Power Development Plan](https://www.epra.go.ke/energy-planning-inep-medium-term-plans) (LCPDP) guides future investments, ensuring geothermal continues to be prioritized due to its reliability and cost-effectiveness. Complementing these are procurement reforms: Kenya is **transitioning from the former feed-in-tariff (FiT) system to a Renewable Energy Auction Policy (REAP)**. This shift aims to increase transparency and cost-competitiveness, especially for large-scale projects over 20 MW. Geothermal developers are now selected via competitive bidding, enhancing investor confidence and enabling better alignment with national demand forecasts. To fully realize its geothermal potential, Kenya is also opening its electricity market. The Electricity Market, Bulk Supply and Open Access Regulations (2024) permit private participation in transmission and distribution, historically state-controlled. These reforms, while still in early stages, are intended to attract private capital into grid infrastructure and encourage more independent power producers (IPPs) to enter the geothermal space. Despite progress, challenges remain. Kenya’s grid experiences high transmission and distribution losses—23% in 2023—due to outdated infrastructure, theft, and billing inefficiencies. Nevertheless, smart grid initiatives and performance-based regulations are underway, aiming to improve reliability and reduce losses, which in turn would make geothermal investments more bankable. Geothermal in Kenya is not limited to power generation. The Geothermal Development Company (GDC) is actively exploring direct-use applications in agriculture, industry, and tourism. [Demonstration projects in milk pasteurization](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/gdc-pilot-testing-direct-use-applications-of-geothermal-energy/), aquaculture, and greenhouse heating are already operational. These applications present new commercial opportunities and foster rural economic development. Furthermore, Kenya is pioneering in geothermal-powered carbon capture, with the [Project Hummingbird direct air capture](https://www.klimate.co/project/project-hummingbird) facility in Naivasha – one of the world’s largest pilots of its kind—illustrating how geothermal can underpin innovative climate technologies. Despite high inflation and fiscal constraints, Kenya remains a top destination for development finance and climate investment in Africa. [The Energy Transition and Investment Plan (2023–2050)](https://energy.go.ke/sites/default/files/KAWI/Kenya-ETIP-2050%202.pdf) estimates that $600 billion will be required to meet climate and energy targets, with geothermal continuing to play a central role. To unlock greater private sector participation, especially in geothermal development, Kenya must address regulatory complexity, improve inter-agency coordination, and provide clarity around fiscal incentives. The upcoming review of the National Energy Policy (2018) offers a strategic opportunity to streamline governance and accelerate geothermal deployment. **Kenya’s geothermal sector is a model for how policy can foster renewable energy leadership. With a solid legal framework, proactive auction mechanisms, and growing international interest, the country is poised to scale up geothermal deployment significantly. The challenge now lies in translating policy into streamlined execution, robust investment, and equitable access – delivering both climate resilience and inclusive economic growth.** To read the IEA report, check out this [link](https://www.iea.org/reports/kenya-2024).

    "date": "23 Apr 2025",
    "content": "The city of Bogács in Hungary has undertaken a project to deliver geothermal heat to public buildings using excess heat from their decades-old thermal baths. The city of Bogács in Hungary has completed the construction of a heating distribution system that utilizes excess geothermal heat from its existing thermal baths. A minimal amount of the investment on the project came from the city, as about 90% of the costs were received in the form of a subsidy from the Swiss Fund under the “Geothermal Energy Resources for District and Urban Heating” program. The system now provides inexpensive and emissions-free heating to eleven public institution buildings, including the Mayor’s Office, the Municipal Library, a Kindergarten, Elementary School, Central Kitchen, and the Community House. **Utilizing excess heat from the thermal spa** Since the 2000s, there have already been efforts to more efficiently use the excess heat from the thermal spa in Bogács. Water at 70 °C is discharged from the thermal well in the Bogács spa area, which is too hot for filling the pools. Thus, some of the heat is redirected to heat the buildings in the spa area, and for the air-conditioning equipment for the dehumidification of the indoor pools. There was, however, still some excess heat extracted to reduce the temperature of the water to the ideal 37-38 °C for the pools. The plan was then to use the excess heat to provide heating to a number of public buildings located outside the thermal spa. To do this, the municipality had to build a new heating distribution network, as well as a new connection to the the existing energy supply system of the heating center. The city estimated an investment of HUF 205 million (approx. 570,000 for the project). Csendesné Farkas Edit, Mayor of Bogacs, also recounted how the city had difficulties in securing permits for the project. The plan had to go through several authorities, including the Environmental Protection Authority, the Water Directorate, and Disaster Management. The permit process started in June 2023 and the permit was granted in August 2024. **A project enabled by significant funding support** The public procurement procedure was conducted in the spring of 2024, and Midvex Épít? Kft. submitted the most favorable offer, for a net cost of 180 million HUF. Construction began in September 2024, and the works were completed at the end of December. In January, test heating of the system was done, with thermal heat providing heat in practically every building, and there was no need for gas heating. Meanwhile, in May 2024, the Swiss Fund announced a call for applications for a grant for projects utilizing geothermal energy. The city applied for the grant. Following the evaluation, the Evaluation Committee decided on a grant of 168.8 million HUF, thus covering more than 90% of the project costs. This freed up the money from the city, which was then redirected to the renovation of a municipal building. **A win-win scenario** The result of the project is that there will be practically no heating costs for the public buildings connected to the geothermal network. Gas heating will only be used in cases of extreme cold. This means that the city saves HUF 20-25 million per year. More so, there is less excess heat needed to be extracted from the thermal water before they used to fill the pools, so less cool water is also needed. More importantly, the switch from gas heating will reduce the CO2 emissions from the heating system while also protecting it from the vulnerability of gas prices.",

The 3D seismic measurements will cover an area of 40 square kilometers encompassing the Medimurje and Koprivnica-Križevci counties. Between 1000 to 1500 geophones will be deployed and will receive seismic signals emitted by four vibroseis trucks. The survey will extend beyond the boundaries of the Kotoriba geothermal resource area to create a more comprehensive model of the subsurface. Viola Energy Generation is a project firm of Turkish company Soyak, which has been quite active in geothermal projects in Croatia. The initial proposal of the company for the Kotoriba site involves a EUR 25 million investment and the drilling of two wells. Earlier this year, the company was granted [the permit to develop a 98-MW geothermal power project in Legrad](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/turkish-soyak-group-to-develop-98-mw-project-in-croatia/) through subsidiary Terra Enerji.",

The Philippine government is planning to tap an initial $100 million from the Geothermal Resource De-Risking Facility managed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), according to the Department of Energy (DoE). The facility aims to reduce investment risks in geothermal exploration and is part of a larger $250 million financing package. The Philippine government is planning to tap an initial $100 million from the Geothermal Resource De-Risking Facility managed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), according to the Department of Energy (DoE). The facility aims to reduce investment risks in geothermal exploration and is part of a larger $250 million financing package. “It’s possible that our first tranche is $100 million. That’s what we’re looking at. We want to make sure that the private sector can absorb the facility offering,” said Energy Undersecretary Rowena Cristina L. Guevara during the ADB Asia Clean Energy Forum earlier this week. According to the [ADB project page](https://www.adb.org/projects/58245-001/main), the facility is backed by $190 million from ADB’s ordinary capital resources and $60 million in concessional funds from the ASEAN Catalytic Green Finance Facility. The program is designed to address the high-risk profile of geothermal power development and encourage private sector participation. The geothermal de-risking facility is currently in its final preparatory stage. The DoE is in discussions with the Land Bank of the Philippines (LANDBANK) to serve as the facility’s manager, with operations expected to begin next year. Approval is still pending from the Investment Coordination Committee of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), according to Energy Assistant Secretary Mylene C. Capongcol. As of 2023, the Philippines had an installed geothermal capacity of 1,952 MW, ranking third globally behind Indonesia and the United States. However, the third Green Energy Auction in February 2024 attracted bids for only 30.9 MW of geothermal capacity, far short of the 100 MW target – highlighting the need for mechanisms to improve investor confidence. If implemented, the de-risking facility could help unlock new geothermal potential and strengthen the country’s clean energy transition.",

    "date": "21 Apr 2025",
    "content": "HS Orka has started exploration drilling at the Sveifluháls area in Krýsuvík, Iceland to verify geothermal resources for power generation and heating. The plan is to drill a direction well up to 2750 meters long to a depth of over two kilometers under Sveifluhálsinn to the northwest. The goal is for the well to verify the high-temperature resources and evaluate their utilization in the Sveifluháls – Austurengjar area. Additional deep exploration wells are planned, and preparations have already begun for the next drilling site with planning work and an environmental impact assessment. Drilling operations are being done by [Iceland Drilling](https://www.jardboranir.is/), using the Odin drill rig. The drill is powered by electricity, so drilling does not involve the use of oil to power its power plants, except for the first few weeks, until a new transformer station is in operation. If the research yields the desired results, the aim is to build a geothermal power plant at Sveifluháls. The exact location of the planned power plant is yet to be decided. The results from the research drilling will be critical to this decision, as will the environmental assessment of the projects and the interaction with the nature of Krýsuvík and other economic activities in the area. An environmental assessment for the proposed construction in Krýsuvík is being prepared, but the overall project timeline spans nearly a decade. The geothermal power plant in Sveifluháls was part of a list of planned new geothermal power projects in Iceland [announced back in 2016](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/iceland-could-see-up-to-7-new-geothermal-projects-until-2035/). The Hafnarfjörður Municipality owns the part of the Krýsuvík area where the research is being conducted. Krýsuvík is a popular outdoor recreation area and a popular tourist destination, but also has a significant industrial history. The geothermal development in Krýsuvík is expected to provide security to the supply of hot water, as the area currently predominantly relies on supply from the Nesjavellir hydroelectric power plant and the Hellisheidi hydroelectric power plant in the Hengil area. In June 2024, the Hafnarfjörður Municipality and HS Orka signed an agreement on authorization for research, land use, land lease, and utilization of resource rights in connection with the potential utilization of resources in Krýsuvík. Part of the agreement is that the parties will work together on other developments that utilize resource flows from the power plant, similar to what is being done under the name Auðlindagarðsinn at HS Orka’s power plants in Svartsengi and Reykjanesvirkjun. Emphasis will be placed on the development of eco-friendly tourism that is in harmony with the environment and nature, along with facilities for outdoor recreation as well as green business activities such as algae cultivation, natural chemical processing, greenhouse cultivation and more.",

    "content": "El Salvador has approved a financial guarantee for a World Bank loan that could advance CEL’s 25 MW Chinameca geothermal project and future expansion phases. El Salvador has taken a key step toward developing a new geothermal power plant in Chinameca with the approval of a sovereign guarantee for a loan from the World Bank. The measure, recently ratified by the Legislative Assembly, supports the financing of a 25 MW geothermal project led by state-owned utility CEL (Comisión Ejecutiva Hidroeléctrica del Río Lempa). The loan will be used to fund construction of the Chinameca geothermal plant on the southern flank of the Chinameca Volcano in the department of San Miguel. The loan managed by CEL will have a 30-year repayment term, including a six-year grace period. The project is expected to generate clean, baseload electricity and contribute to the country’s renewable energy goals. The project includes four parts: the first involves drilling up to eight wells to confirm geothermal resources, thereby confirming the expansion of production capacity and increasing steam production. The second component of the loan covers the construction of a geothermal power plant in Chinameca , San Miguel, with a capacity of up to 25 MW; as well as a steam collection system for the Chinameca power plant, and the construction of a connection from that plant to the substation to be built to connect the new plant to the national grid. The third component of the loan involves the adoption of social and environmental programs and the creation of a Geothermal Center of Excellence “to train students and professionals in industry-related topics,” the Ministry of Finance noted. Finally, the last component to be implemented is the hiring of experts to provide technical assistance and support management areas in the execution. In its initial phase, the plant will provide 25 MW of capacity, with CEL also outlining the potential for a second-phase expansion to 40 MW in total. According to La Prensa Gráfica, the project’s development had long been on hold, and this financial backing could unlock progress toward implementation. The loan is part of a broader agreement with the World Bank to support renewable energy infrastructure and energy security in El Salvador. The sovereign guarantee ensures state support for repayment, which is a key condition for disbursing the funds. The geothermal sector plays an important role in El Salvador’s energy mix, and the Chinameca project adds to ongoing efforts to expand generation capacity through sustainable domestic resources.",

A slimhole drilled to a depth of 1.76 kilometers in the Sembawang site in norther Singapore indicate a subsurface temperature of up to 122 °C, indicating a strong geothermal resource potential. The results of the second borehole, drilled in February 2024, are significantly higher than the first borehole that was drilled in 2023. The first slimhole was drilled in Admiralty to a depth of 1.12 kilometers, with a measured temperature of 70 °C, [as reported previously.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/research-shows-geothermal-potential-at-site-near-singapore-hot-spring/) The results of the exploration drilling campaign were shared in a recent public symposium organized the joint research team of [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) (NTU) and [Technical University of Munich at the Singapore Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise](https://www.tum-create.edu.sg/) (TUMCREATE). The joint research team is led by [Professor Alessandro Romagnoli](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/interview-singapore-asias-newest-emerging-geothermal-market/) from the Energy Research Institute @ NTU (ERI@N) and Dr Tobias Massier from TUMCREATE. The temperature profiles of the Admiralty and Sembawang wells indicate a thermal gradient between 40 – 44 °C/km, about twice the global average. If this gradient remains unchanged at deeper regions, the rock temperature could reach 230 °C at a depth of 5000 meters. This is highly favorable for geothermal power generation and direct heat applications. _“The results mean that we have strong potential for electricity generation and district cooling using commercially available technologies in the geothermal energy sector. The unique combination of elevated heat gradients and high heat-producing granites offers us compelling reasons to pursue further mapping of the northern subsurface,”_ said Prof. Romagnoli.",

Australia-based company [Groundlink Energy Pty Ltd](https://groundlinkenergy.com/) (Groundlink Energy) has been granted a geothermal exploration license for a site in Takara, north of the Efate Island, which is part of the islands of Vanuatu. The project is currently transitioning to the drilling phase, which will determine the resource’s capacity for electricity generation. _“Groundlink Energy is honoured to be working with the Government and the people of Vanuatu to undertake exploration activities across the licence area in North Efate,”_ said Groundlink Energy co-founder Tim Horneman. _“This licence is an important step in the journey toward the future construction and operation of a geothermal power plant to deliver lower-cost, lower-emissions electricity to Vanuatu. With connectivity to the grid possible through existing transmission infrastructure, the project is well placed to make a contribution to the economy of Vanuatu.”_ Groundlink Energy becomes the third overseas company to meet the full regulatory requirements for a geothermal exploration license in Vanuatu under the Geothermal Act No. 40 of 2019. The exploration license granted to the company is under the oversight of the Geothermal Exploration Advisory Board, which was established under the Geothermal Act to regulate geothermal development activities in Vanuatu. Standards on performance, environmental management, and local engagement have been set by the regulation. _“The company underwent extensive vetting, including checks by the Vanuatu Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and the Vanuatu Financial Services Commission (VFSC), to ensure they were a genuine entity with both the technical and financial capacity to carry out the exploration works within the life of the license,”_ commented Benjamin Titus, Licensing and Tenement Registrar at the [Geology and Mines Unit](https://mol.gov.vu/index.php/component/content/article/page?catid=2&Itemid=280) of Vanuatu. Titus also stated that the company had conducted consultation sessions with the relevant villages in North Efate, and that the communities have responded positively to the exploration work. He also assured that the Board will continue to closely monitor the project: _“Our role is to ensure that Vanuatu’s geothermal resources are developed in a manner that is sustainable, transparent, and beneficial to all stakeholders.”_ A UK-based company, Stellae Energy, had recently [signed an MoU with the Government of Vanuatu](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/stellae-energy-announces-geothermal-power-project-in-vanuatu/) to explore and develop geothermal power projects, although no specific site had been mentioned. The Takara site had been an area of interest for geothermal development of another Australian company, KuTH Energy, starting 2009. A resource with a size of 2-10 MW (P90 of 9.6 MW) was delineated by studies at the time. However, the company [withdrew from the project in 2016](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/developing-geothermal-energy-on-vanuatu-pacific-key-areas-of-interest/), citing expensive drilling costs.",

    "date": "25 Apr 2025",
    "content": "Texas legislators consider allowing geothermal projects to access the $5 billion Texas Energy Fund, aiming to support dispatchable, clean power alternatives. The Legislature of the State of Texas in the U.S. is reported to advancing proposals that could open the state’s $5 billion [Texas Energy Fund](https://www.txenergyfund.texas.gov/) (TEF) to geothermal energy projects, signaling growing recognition of the technology’s potential to deliver clean, dispatchable power to the grid. The legislation – authored by Republican state Rep. AJ Louderback and passed unanimously out of a Texas House committee – would formally recognize geothermal as a dispatchable energy source, making it eligible to compete for low-interest loans under the TEF. The bill now moves to the full House for a vote. Originally created in 2023 to incentivize the construction of new natural gas plants, the TEF has struggled to meet its goals. At least seven applicants have withdrawn from the program this year, citing issues sourcing gas turbines in time to meet the fund’s project deadlines. As a result, none of the intended 10 GW of new power capacity have materialized so far. **A path forward for geothermal** Geothermal advocates see this as a critical opportunity to reposition the TEF as a technology-neutral mechanism for dispatchable power – one that can support emerging geothermal developers in Texas who are leveraging oil and gas expertise and infrastructure to tap the state’s subsurface heat. _“Opening the TEF to geothermal offers a lifeline to projects that can provide 24/7 low-carbon energy using skills and resources Texas already has,_ ” said a geothermal industry advocate close to the discussions. A second proposal under consideration would allow geothermal projects in the 10 to 100 MW range – smaller than typical gas plants but ideal for current geothermal systems – to qualify for TEF financing. **Political and energy landscape in transition** These geothermal-friendly proposals stand in contrast to other energy-related bills advancing through the Texas Senate, many of which aim to restrict wind and solar development or mandate that renewable energy be backed by fossil fuel power. One such bill, H.B. 3356, would require solar developers to purchase fossil fuel-based backup power, a move critics argue would cost ratepayers billions while exacerbating grid instability. At the same time, lawmakers are weighing a separate $2 billion proposal to support nuclear energy, although no nuclear projects in Texas are currently close to being shovel-ready. **Why Texas is poised for geothermal growth** While Texas lacks the shallow, high-temperature geothermal resources found in states like Nevada or California, it boasts [deep, hot rock formations](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/hotrock-geothermal-research-consortium-kicks-off-in-austin-texas/) and a vast workforce skilled in subsurface mapping, drilling, and reservoir engineering—all critical to modern geothermal development. Recent geothermal resource maps by Project InnerSpace have identified extensive heat resources beneath the state, reinforcing its potential as a future geothermal hub. Even U.S. federal energy leadership has expressed support for geothermal. Energy Secretary Chris Wright and President Trump have both highlighted next-generation geothermal as a strategic clean energy opportunity, including in recent Earth Day messaging. **For the Geothermal Sector** The move to open the TEF to geothermal could mark a turning point for geothermal development in Texas, offering funding, validation, and visibility for an emerging industry segment. It may also serve as a blueprint for other U.S. states with existing fossil fuel infrastructure looking to diversify into clean, dispatchable power.",

The Oita Prefecture of Japan, through the Oita Asahi Broadcasting channel, has published a series of education and quite entertaining series of videos on geothermal energy with particular emphasis on its local applications. The entire video series (in Japanese) can be accessed via the following links: * [Part 1 – Is Oita a geothermal prefecture?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHeqGHmSH9Y) * [Part 2 – Why is geothermal energy attracting attention?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02L3gcBWYD4&pp=0gcJCYQJAYcqIYzv) * [Part 3 – What is the difference between geothermal and hot springs?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DViQzRhitfM) * [Part 4 – The hot relationship between geothermal energy and gourmet food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L4_eOxZ1_Q&pp=0gcJCYQJAYcqIYzv) * [Part 5 – What is the future of geothermal energy?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDpAdq_Isww) The video series goes through the basics of geothermal energy, the industries it has created in the Oita Prefecture, and what lies ahead for geothermal energy in the region. Oita Prefecture, part of the Japan’s Kyushu Island, is an interesting setting as it is one of the most well-known “onsen” or hot spring destinations. The city of Beppu, in particular, houses an extensive hot spring system and is also the site of [intensive geothermal power development.](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/minami-tateishi-is-first-geothermal-power-project-in-japan-to-receive-green-loan/) A segment of the video series focuses on the Hatchobaru Power Station, a 110-MW geothermal power plant operated by Kyuden Mirai. Unit 1 of Hatchobaru was commissioned back in 1977, and a second unit started operations in 1986. Today, Hatchobaru remains the largest geothermal power plant in Japan in terms of installed capacity. An interesting part of the video series highlights “Jigoku Mushi,” a traditional Beppu cooking style that uses the natural steam from hot springs. Diners can select from a wide range of fresh food including seafood, sausages, chicken, and vegetables before it is placed inside a cooker connected to a natural geothermal vent. The mineral-infused steam adds a district flavor to the food, making this a unique and very novel use of geothermal steam. Jigoku Mushi is offered by many restaurants and onsen facilities in the Oita Prefecture. The video series also touches on the use of geothermal heating in greenhouses, the market for “Yunohana” or hot spring deposits, and the efforts to explore the use of geothermal power for green hydrogen production with valuable insights provided by geothermal experts at the Beppu University . The Oita Prefecture presents a compelling case study on [how geothermal power plants can co-exist harmoniously](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/okuhida-onsengo-japan-showcases-co-existence-of-hot-springs-and-geothermal-power/) with traditional “hot spring” culture and other small-scale industries like agriculture, restaurants, and hot spring baths.",

    "content": "The Bureau of Land Management has opened nominations for land parcels to be included in a geothermal lease sale in Idaho scheduled for October 2026. The [Bureau of Land Management](https://www.blm.gov/) (BLM) is once again accepting nominations for public lands for a planned geothermal lease, this time to be held in Idaho and tentatively scheduled on October 2026. All nominations for this lease sale must be received by **1 October 2025**. The call for nominations comes just before a planned Idaho geothermal lease sale, [which is taking place on 9 September 2025](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/blm-to-hold-idaho-geothermal-lease-sale-on-september-2025/). The lease sale will offer nine parcels totaling nearly 20,615 acres in Elmore and Washington counties and about 3,740 acres in Bonneville Country. Nominations are not automatically placed for sale when received, and the BLM cannot guarantee that the nominated lands will be included. The parcels must be reviewed for availability as well as natural resource and cultural concerns prior to being made available for sale. Each nomination must be submitted with a nonrefundable filing fee of $145 plus $0.14 per acre of land nominated. Geothermal energy is a renewable resource that generates baseload electricity with minimal carbon emissions. It is an abundant resource, especially in the West, where the BLM has authority to manage geothermal resource leasing, exploration, and development on approximately 245 million surface acres of public lands and the 700 million acres where the United States owns the subsurface mineral estate. Leasing is the first step in the process to develop federal geothermal resources. The BLM ensures geothermal development meets the requirements set forth by the [National Environmental Policy Act](https://www.blm.gov/announcement/blm-accepting-nominations-geothermal-development-idaho#/programs/planning-and-nepa) of 1969 and other applicable legal authorities. Geothermal lease sales support domestic energy production and American energy independence, while contributing to the nation’s economic and military security.",

    "content": "Quang Ngai province in Vietnam proposes including a 25 MW geothermal power project in the national Power Development Plan. The Binh Dinh province in Vietnam has proposed the inclusion of the 15-MW Hoi Van geothermal power project into Vietnam’s Power Development Plan VIII (PDP8). The proposed site is at the Cat Hiep commune in the Phu Cat district. Under a power source structure approved in a decision by the Prime Minister from April 2025, Binh Dinh is expected to devleop approx. 45 MW in geothermal and other new energy by 2045. If approved, the project would help diversify the local energy mix and contribute to the national goal of increasing the share of renewable energy in the power system. While there have been some news from time to time about the interest of Vietnam in geothermal, like a [general interest in geothermal by the governmen](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/government-of-vietnam-considers-exploring-countrys-geothermal-potential/)t and [Icelandic partners](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/icelandic-and-vietnamese-law-firms-to-cooperate-on-geothermal-regulatory-reform-and-funding/), so far this is the most concrete proposal we have seen. The provincial Department of Industry and Trade has submitted a formal request to the Ministry of Industry and Trade for review. The request includes technical documentation and initial survey data supporting the project’s feasibility. A proposal to develop the Hoi Van geothermal power project and the Hoi Van resort project was submitted by the LIOA Geothermal Power Joint Stock Company to the People’s Committee of Binh Dinh province in 2024. According to the proposal, a total investment of VND 850 billion (approx. USD 32.7 million) will be needed to develop the 15-MW project. According to officials, geothermal development could bring long-term benefits for Quang Ngai, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions and greater energy independence for remote communities. Including the proposed geothermal project in PDP8 provides the framework to attract the needed investment. While geothermal has yet to be widely developed in Vietnam, interest is growing due to the country’s volcanic geology in certain regions.",

    "author": "Carlo Cariaga",
    "date": "12 Aug 2025",
    "content": "A new 81-kilometer transmission line is being built in Kenya, helping distribute geothermal power to the western region and easing pressure on existing lines. The[ Kenya Electricity Transmission Company](https://www.ketraco.co.ke/) (KETRACO) has broken ground on the construction of a new 81-kilometer 132kV Narok-Bomet transmission line, which will distribute surplus geothermal power from the Olkaria Geothermal Complex to the western parts of the country. This will lessen the burden on existing transmission lines while improving system resilience and allowing the retirement of the 60-MW Muhoroni gas turbine. The new transmission line will run from Narok to Bomet, and connect with the existing network towards Sotik and Kisii. This will also provide an alternative power supply from Olkaria to the South Nyanza region. [The existing network running from Lessos](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-transmission-lines-to-supply-geothermal-power-to-western-kenya-next-year/) is already currently constrained, thus requiring an evacuation corridor. In late 2024, KETRACO awarded the construction contract for the Narok-Bomet transmission line to Chinese firm North China Power Engineering Company. This is part of the Kenya Transmission Network Improvement Project (KTNIP) which has a total budget of Sh 15.6 billion (approx. USD 120 million). Two other lines, the Weru-Malindi-Kilifi and Rumuruti-Kabarnet networks, will be built later. Just about a week ago, state-owned power company KenGen received Cabinet approval for the [planned Olkaria VII geothermal power station](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/kengen-receives-cabinet-approval-for-olkaria-vii-geothermal-power-plant-kenya/), which will expand the installed capacity of the Olkaria Geothermal Complex by a further 80.3 MW. Investment on expanding and upgrading the transmission network in Kenya bodes well both for the growth of the local geothermal sector and increasing the resiliency and access of the national electricity network.",
