    "date": "May 29, 2025",
    "author": "Infinium",
    "content": "Infinium, the world’s leading producer of commercially available eFuels, announced that construction is underway on its second U.S.-based eFuels production site, known as Project Roadrunner. The project, which includes investors Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, is located in Reeves County, Texas, near the city of Pecos.\nThe site is expected to become the world’s largest eFuels production facility when operational, producing 23,000 tonnes per year (7.6 million gallons) of sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other eFuel products for customers including global aviation leaders American Airlines and IAG, owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and other international airline brands.\n“Infinium’s Project Roadrunner marks a huge achievement for the fuel industry,” said Infinium CEO Robert Schuetzle. “Not only will the project produce commercial eSAF for its customers, it will bring highly skilled jobs and economic growth to the Pecos community and state of Texas. This project demonstrates the ongoing commitment of Infinium, its investors, and partners to help ensure that the United States remains a global leader in energy security, resilience and innovation.” \neFuels are synthetic fuels, produced from waste CO2 and renewable energy, that are chemically identical to conventional petroleum-based fuels. These drop-in fuels are used in the transportation and chemicals sectors, seamlessly integrating with existing engines, infrastructure, and manufacturing processes. Infinium eFuels provide an opportunity for energy diversification while leveraging the global infrastructure that powers the transportation and chemicals industries today. In 2023, Infinium became the world’s first to produce and ship commercial volumes of eFuels to customers in the U.S. and Europe from its production facility, Project Pathfinder, in Corpus Christi, Texas.\nThe Roadrunner project reached financial close with investments from Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst and is now under construction. The project represents significant investment in the region and will support highly skilled direct labor jobs in construction, fabrication, operations, and logistics locally and across Texas. Commercial agreements for the project—including feedstock, vendor and offtake contracts — have been structured and de-risked to attract the infrastructure capital and debt required for the continued scaling of the eFuels market.\nInfinium’s Project Roadrunner facility will convert waste CO2 and renewable energy to produce sustainable aviation fuel, leveraging new renewable power assets purpose-built for the project. The fuels produced by the Roadrunner project will be sold domestically in the U.S. and exported to international markets. Under a landmark agreement with airline group IAG, the eSAF will be shipped to the UK to satisfy compliance requirements under the recently enacted UK SAF Mandate which requires that at least 10% of all jet fuel in flights taking off from the UK is sourced from sustainable feedstocks by 2030.\n“The construction of Project Roadrunner represents a real step forward in the production of sustainable aviation fuel at scale,” said Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s Group Sustainability Officer. “We’re proud to be an early customer of Infinium’s eSAF and working hard to procure and invest in SAF to deliver our 10% 2030 SAF goal. The aviation industry is making progress, but continued support and stronger incentives are necessary to accelerate production at the scale and pace required to ensure a long-term, affordable supply.”\nCurrently under construction, the facility is expected to reach commercial operations in 2027. Roadrunner has secured 150 MW of new wind generation capacity from a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources through a long-term power purchase agreement.\n\"We are pleased to support Infinium’s Roadrunner project, which reflects a significant step forward for an emerging new market for renewable electricity,” said Petter Skantze, Senior Vice President, Infrastructure Development for NextEra Energy Resources. “The United States has tremendous potential to use its abundant energy resources to serve global demand, and we’re excited to expand our investment in Texas to enable Infinium’s industry-leading electro-fuels production facility.\"\nInfinium selected leading electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen to supply its complete 100 megawatt (MW) HYPRPlant solution for the project, which will be integrated on site for green hydrogen production1. This large-scale system will not only produce hydrogen for the eSAF facility but will also have capacity to support future hydrogen offtake opportunities. \n“Infinium’s Project Roadrunner stands as a remarkable example of how next-generation technologies can rapidly evolve from proof-of-concept to finance-ready infrastructure,” said Mario Fernandez, Head of Breakthrough Energy Catalyst. “At BE Catalyst, we are proud to have partnered with Infinium from the onset to help shape this project, positioning it to attract the necessary infrastructure capital required to scale and accelerate the delivery of eFuels into the market.”\n“Our investments in Infinium and Project Roadrunner are the first Brookfield has committed to sustainable aviation fuel,” said Laura Hellman, Senior Vice President at Brookfield. “We are excited about our partnership with Infinium which will help advance sustainability within the aviation sector consistent with the goals of our investment strategy.”\nThe Roadrunner project underscores expanded support for innovative solutions that meet the market’s growing demand for resilient energy supply chains, while decarbonizing and utilizing products that leverage the existing infrastructure and engines in use today. By enabling eFuels to be used as pure fuel or blended with petroleum-based products, Infinium solutions can be used to significantly reduce the overall carbon footprint of the energy supply chain. Supported by top industry leaders in energy and infrastructure, Infinium is expanding its development of eFuel facilities both across the U.S. and internationally. This growth will not only contribute to the expansion and diversification of fuel market supply options but also offer low-carbon alternatives to augment conventional fuels relied on today. \n1Breakthrough Energy Ventures is an investor in Electric Hydrogen"

    "date": "September 4, 2025",
    "author": "Johnathan Adams, University of Houston",
    "content": "Sometimes less really is more — at least that is the case when it comes to improving carbon capture systems, according to a team of researchers at the University of Houston.\nLed by Mim Rahimi, a professor at UH’s Cullen College of Engineering, the team made two significant breakthroughs that could reduce the cost of capturing harmful emissions from power plants, marking a major step in addressing climate change.\nThe first breakthrough, [_published in Nature Communications_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61525-3), introduces a membraneless electrochemical process that slashes energy requirements for amine-based carbon dioxide (CO₂) capture. The second breakthrough, [_featured on the cover of ES &T Engineering_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsestengg.4c00631), demonstrates a vanadium redox flow system capable of both capturing carbon and storing renewable energy.\n“Climate change mitigation was basically the reason we pursued this research,” Rahimi said. “We need solutions, and we wanted to be part of the solution. The biggest suspect out there is CO₂ emissions, so the low-hanging fruit would be to eliminate those emissions.”\nOriginally published in a research paper titled “A Membraneless Electrochemically Mediated Amine Regeneration for Carbon Capture,” the team first focused on replacing the conventional ion-exchange membrane in the electrochemically mediated amine regeneration process with gas diffusion electrodes.\nThat proved to be a game-changer. Not only were the membranes the most expensive part of the system, but they were also a primary reason for performance issues and maintenance cost.\nBy engineering the gas diffusion electrodes, the team was able to achieve more than 90% CO₂ removal, nearly 50% more than traditional EMAR approaches. That’s a capture cost of approximately $70 per metric ton of CO₂, which makes it competitive with state-of-the-art amine scrubbing methods, according to Ph.D. student Ahmad Hassan.\n“By removing the membrane and the associated hardware, we’ve streamlined the EMAR workflow and dramatically cut energy use,” said Hassan, who was leading author of the paper. “This opens the door to retrofitting existing industrial exhaust systems with a compact, low-cost carbon capture module.”\nFellow Ph.D. student Mohsen Afshari built on those advances, publishing his findings in “A Vanadium Redox Flow Process for Carbon Capture and Energy Storage.” That paper presented a reversible flow battery architecture that absorbs CO₂ during charging and releases it upon discharge.\nBy leveraging the vanadium’s chemistry, the process displayed strong cycle stability and a high capture capacity, suggesting the technology could provide carbon removal and grid balancing when paired with intermittent renewables.\n“Integrating carbon capture directly into a redox flow battery lets us tackle two challenges in one device,” Afshari said. “Our front-cover feature highlights its potential to smooth out renewable generation while sequestering CO₂.”\nThese discoveries promise to make waves for carbon capture technology and the energy industry going forward, with the ultimate goal being to reduce the carbon footprint associated with everyone.\n“These publications reflect our group’s commitment to fundamental electrochemical innovation and real-world applicability,” Rahimi said. “From membraneless systems to scalable flow systems, we’re charting pathways to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors and support the transition to a low-carbon economy.”"

    "author": "ExxonMobil",
    "content": "ExxonMobil Benelux has kicked off construction on its Carbonate Fuel Cell (CFC) pilot project in Rotterdam, aiming to capture over 90% of CO₂ from natural gas emissions while simultaneously producing power, hydrogen, and heat. The scalable system, developed in partnership with FuelCell Energy, could reshape CCS economics by making carbon capture not a cost center—but a generator of clean energy.\nThe first foundation pile has been driven at ExxonMobil’s Rotterdam Manufacturing Complex, marking the start of construction for its Carbonate Fuel Cell (CFC) pilot plant—a project that could redefine the economics of carbon capture and storage (CCS). Developed in collaboration with U.S.-based FuelCell Energy, the system will demonstrate how fuel cell stacks can capture CO₂ from industrial flue gas while simultaneously generating electricity, heat, and hydrogen.\nThe Rotterdam pilot represents a milestone in ExxonMobil's efforts to commercialize next-generation CCS. According to the company: “Scientists at ExxonMobil and FuelCell Energy, Inc. are jointly pursuing new technology that could reduce the costs associated with current CCS processes by increasing the amount of electricity a power plant produces while simultaneously delivering significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.”\nLab testing has shown that applying carbonate fuel cells to natural gas-fired generation could enable capture of over 90% of CO₂ emissions—while producing additional power instead of consuming it. The modular fuel cell design means the setup can be tailored to various industrial sites, making the technology scalable and adaptable.\nDuring the ceremonial launch, ExxonMobil project manager Menno Spaanderman expressed appreciation for the entire international project team: “This celebration is not only for driving this first pile, it is also an appreciation to the entire global project team and all other stakeholders who make it possible for us to start the construction work of the pilot plant here in Rotterdam.”\nThe Rotterdam project is part of ExxonMobil Benelux’s broader decarbonisation strategy and underscores its intention to deploy viable, commercial-scale CCS solutions across its global operations. With carbon regulations tightening across Europe and industrial decarbonisation targets looming, the success of this project could open a pathway for broader adoption of power-generating CCS."

This Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology is a critical tool in achieving net-zero targets and has the potential to drive real, measurable change in combating climate change.\nThis deployment marked the first industrial-scale field test of the technology. The demonstrator has been operating for three months at Dublin Airport, collecting critical data on efficiency, operational stability, and energy consumption. Insights gained from this deployment have provided crucial validation of the technology performance and will shape future development and commercial applications.\nProf. Wolfgang Schmitt pointed out the impact of this technology, stating, “Atmospheric carbon capture innovations are crucial because they directly address one of the most pressing challenges we face today—reducing carbon emissions from industries that can't easily eliminate them at the source. By advancing and integrating this technology across industries, we are not only reducing emissions but also creating economic opportunities through supplying high-purity CO₂ that align with global sustainability goals.”\n“This technology has the potential to be a cornerstone in the global effort to combat climate change, and the idea that this could contribute to a solution that makes a real difference is incredibly motivating.”\nDr Sebastien Vaesen, technical lead, emphasised the transformative potential of the technology, adding: “Our technology is designed for industrial deployment, efficiently capturing CO₂ from the air while utilising low-grade waste heat from industries. We have enhanced CO₂ capture efficiency by integrating innovative design features and optimising key operational conditions using our laboratory test rig.”\n“The deployment at Dublin Airport is a key validation for scaling up and allows us to gather critical performance data in a live operational setting and fine-tune it for long-term sustainable operation. Moreover, we are strongly committed to the technology commercialisation, and this deployment is a major stepping stone.”\nThis technology deployment aims to further demonstrate its potential for the aviation and e-fuel industries, directly addressing the European Commission's ReFuelEU Aviation legislation, which mandates that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) comprise 2% of fuel at EU airports by 2025, increasing to 70% by 2050. Furthermore, it also requires e-fuels, produced from renewable electricity and sustainable CO₂, to constitute 50% of the SAF.\nAndrea Carroll, Director of Sustainability at daa, the operators of Dublin Airport, said: “We are pleased to support Trinity College Dublin's trial of carbon capture technology at Dublin Airport. This project offers daa an opportunity to explore carbon capture as a potential means of decarbonising our operations and industry. The collaboration between Trinity College Dublin and Dublin Airport exemplifies the kind of forward-thinking partnerships that are essential for driving innovation and real change as we all make our way towards a Net Zero world.”\nDr Elham Katoueizadeh, Project Developer for this technology, highlighted that developed over more than 10 years of research and innovation, this technology is now ready for large-scale implementation across industries, recognising the urgent need for scalable carbon capture solutions. Following the start of this field test, the team is focusing on securing additional investment and partnerships to expand and accelerate commercial adoption."

    "content": "The FSIU would be able to receive LCO₂ transported in low pressure condition, store, and inject it into subsea wells at high pressure for permanent sequestration, which eliminates a need for onshore LCO₂ receiving plant and pipeline to injection wells. The unit is engineered for a maximum CO₂ injection capacity of 10 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), with a minimum total tank storage capacity of 100,000 m³.\nTo support uninterrupted injection operation, the FSIU will feature both tandem loading at the aft and simultaneous side-by-side loading at the midship port side, enabling flexible and efficient LCO₂ transfer from LCO₂ carriers, up to 90,000 m³ capacity (tandem) and up to 50,000 m³ (side-by-side). The FSIU hull was developed in collaboration with Mitsubishi Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. (MSB), while the mooring system incorporates a SOFEC External Turret to allow dual loading operation as well as station keeping in non-directional environment as often found in Southeast Asia. The FSIU will also be equipped with diesel engine generators integrated with a carbon capture system on the topside, minimizing operational CO₂ emissions.\nThis concept was developed in collaboration with Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd. (“MOL”), to leverage their experience and market position with LCO₂ carriers and its proven methods of safe storage, transport and offloading.\nBy serving as an offshore storage and injection hub, the FSIU enables the sequestration of CO₂ into qualified reservoirs. By offering large-scale, flexible, and reliable offshore CO₂ storage, this solution supports the global transition to low-carbon energy.\nThis collaborative approach is positioned as a further example of a “Concept Design of Floating Alternative Energy Production Facility” as stated in [ _the Mid-term Business Plan 2024-2026 “Explore a Sustainable Future with Innovation”_](https://www.modec.com/ir/strategy/midterm.html). The concept of carbon storage and injection is achieved by leveraging MODEC’s expertise in overall layout, hull design and mooring technology, cultivated in Oil & Gas FPSO projects, with MOL’s expertise in LCO₂ transport. This FSIU is designed for a wide range of offshore field locations and potential clients.\nMODEC considers this AiP as further demonstration of a floating solution for alternative energy production and will continue to strive to refine and mature this concept to address the key challenges for commercialization identified during this development. We will contribute to the effective reduction of emissions through innovative, technically sound and cost-effective solutions, continuing in striving to achieve the decarbonization of the global energy supply chain through developing new technologies for a sustainable future.\n  \n_Arata Kamishohara, VP Business and Project Development at MODEC noted:_  \n“While this FSIU is a new concept, each component on the unit is not necessarily new to MODEC. MODEC has experience of CO₂ injection (removed from pre-combustion produced gas) and dual (oil) offloading system. All the utility systems are similar to what we do on FPSOs every day. We collaborated with MOL, who cover the transportation portion of CCUS value chain, for interfaces between LCO₂ carriers and the FSIU. With this, we are planning to achieve $5/tCO₂ or less, which I don’t think is a stretch target.”\n  \n_Miguel Hernandez, Senior Vice President, Global Offshore said:_  \n“Carbon capture is advancing rapidly, with the International Energy Association projecting global capacity to reach 435 million tonnes per year by 2030. Floating storage and injection units, such as MODEC's innovative design, will be important for enabling the safe and efficient sequestration of captured carbon. This concept is a step forward in delivering the global carbon value chain and ABS is proud to support its development,”\n  \n_Why do we need to take action?_  \nMODEC is committed to both advancing de-carbonization and materializing new business as part of its [_mid-term business plan_](https://www.modec.com/ir/strategy/midterm.html) guided by our dedication to sustainability and innovation. By aligning with global efforts to combat climate change, MODEC aims to support its clients' decarbonization goals, comply with evolving environmental regulations, and enhance its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) profile. These efforts not only reflect MODEC's responsibility to society and the environment but also position the company as a leader in driving technological innovation and sustainable practices within the energy sector. Through proactive emission reduction initiatives, MODEC is future-proofing its operations, strengthening its market competitiveness, and contributing to a more sustainable energy landscape."

The captured CO₂ will then be shipped to the Port of Immingham and stored in the Viking depleted gas fields – this has the potential to be one of the world’s first CO₂ shipping projects, which can act as a pathfinder for industrial emitters which do not have access to a pipeline.\nThe Department of Chemical Engineering at Imperial has a long-standing research track record across the whole carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) chain. It is home to a world-leading Carbon Capture Pilot Plant, and offers an MEng degree in Chemical Engineering with a strong focus on sustainability and particularly carbon management.  \n  \nThe Carbon Capture Pilot Plant itself spans across four floors and serves as a scaled-down representation of a full-scale chemical engineering plant. The Plant demonstrates best practices in capturing carbon dioxide (CO₂), thereby contributing to efforts aimed at mitigating climate change. By partnering with Cory, Imperial aims to bring their research and facilities to an even broader, more diverse audience.\n**Chris Girdham, Development Director at Cory** , said: “Our carbon capture project will be vital for decarbonizing the waste that we process for our customers, as well as bringing a tangible benefit to our local communities by creating jobs and driving investment. The Government’s ambition to create a ‘clean power army’ is exactly the way we need to approach the opportunity presented by net zero – I want young people in the communities we serve to see a job in CCS and think ‘that could be me’. This collaboration is about advancing technology as well as creating new opportunities for the next generation of engineers, designers and technicians. I am delighted that we are working with Imperial on this important initiative.”\n**Professor Omar Matar, Head of Department at Imperial’s Department of Chemical Engineering** , said: “We are excited about our partnership with Cory in various areas of the transition to net zero, particularly within carbon capture. We look forward to a long and fruitful collaboration that brings our two organizations together.”"

HOFOR has an established biomass supply chain to purchase certified sustainable wood pellets and wood chips. The project intends to establish a full BECCS value chain with the capability to remove CO₂ from heat and power production at the facility totaling hundreds of thousands of tonnes annually, supporting Copenhagen’s ambition of being climate positive by 2035.\nThe project is among 10 pre-qualified projects that are eligible for the Danish Energy Agency’s CCS subsidy scheme.\nThe Danish Government recognizes that capture and storage of biogenic CO2 is an effective tool to fight climate change and key to achieving national and international climate ambitions. To support Denmark’s goals, in 2024 the Danish Energy Agency established a USD 4.2 billion CCS fund to support the development of capture, transportation and geological storage of CO2 over a 15-year period.\nIn parallel, Elimini and HOFOR have agreed a CDR marketing agreement under which Elimini will lead the commercialization pathway for the project's verified carbon removal credits. \n“This ambitious partnership with HOFOR is a breakthrough in the scaling of carbon removals,” said **Ross McKenzie, Chief of Staff and Senior Vice President Corporate Affairs and Business Development at Elimini**. “Together, we’re developing a first-of-its-kind model that will capture biogenic CO₂- reducing CO2 levels in the environment, and will generate verified, high-integrity carbon credits.”\n“This agreement represents a pivotal step to supporting Copenhagen’s target of being climate positive and decarbonizing the city’s district heating,” said **Gorm Elikofer, Chief Operating Officer, at HOFOR** “By collaborating with Elimini on carbon capture at Amagerværket, we are building the technical and commercial foundations that will help to advance carbon capture solutions that benefit our city and the broader energy transition.”\nElimini is a development partner for the project in this first stage, using its expertise in BECCS to support HOFOR with the project and marketing for the carbon removal credits. Following further project evaluation, and subject to agreement by both Elimini and HOFOR, the parties will explore the potential formation of a joint venture."

    "date": "July 3, 2025",
    "author": "Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation",
    "content": "The Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD) has successfully completed the world’s first maritime pilot demonstrating the full value chain of onboard captured carbon dioxide (CO2) in China on 25 June 2025.\n  \nThe pilot encompassed two phases. In the first phase, Shanghai Qiyao Environmental Technology Co., Ltd. (SMDERI-QET) conducted a ship-to-ship (STS) transfer of 25.44 metric tons (MT) of captured CO2 from the container vessel MV Ever Top to the receiving vessel Dejin 26. The CO2 was subsequently offloaded from Dejin 26 to a tank truck at a jetty in Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province.\n  \nThe second phase, led by GCMD, involved transporting the captured CO2 to its end-use destination: a joint venture plant between GreenOre and Baotou Steel in Inner Mongolia. There, the LCO2 was successfully used in the production of low-carbon calcium carbonate, a key component in sustainable construction materials.\n  \nThis cross-sectoral demonstration highlights how captured CO2 from ships can be repurposed for industrial applications, linking maritime decarbonisation efforts with broader land-based carbon ecosystem.\n  \nSignificance of the pilot in unlocking the carbon value chain  \nAdvancing maritime decarbonisation at scale requires more than just capturing carbon. It is also essential to address the fate of the captured and offloaded CO2 by establishing a full carbon value chain, including the downstream infrastructure to offload, transport, store and use captured CO2 meaningfully.\n  \nUsing captured CO2 in concrete production offers one of the higher GHG emissions savings among current utilisation pathways, as it partially displaces the need for carbon-intensive cement production ashore. This finding is based on GCMD’s COLOSSUS study, which evaluated life cycle emissions of onboard captured CO2 across various sequestration and utilisation pathways. \n**Pilot conducted under real-world constraints**  \nAs a first-of-its-kind pilot, this project served as a valuable learning experience, helping to uncover real-world challenges that must be addressed to enable the scalable implementation of onboard carbon capture.\n  \nA key challenge was the classification of captured CO2. Designated as “hazardous waste” prohibits its reuse and mandates disposal. Through close coordination with the relevant authorities, the captured CO2 in this pilot was redesignated as “hazardous cargo,” lifting these restrictions and enabling its use as an industrial feedstock.\n  \nFor the pilot, GCMD also identified and brought together stakeholders across the value chain—including a like-minded end user willing to evaluate onboard captured CO2 as its feedstock. With its facility located in Inner Mongolia, the captured CO2 was transported over 2,000 km as a first demonstration in its industrial reuse.\n  \n**Broad ecosystem support**  \nThe pilot involved close collaboration with multiple stakeholders across the value chain, including vessel owner Evergreen Marine Corp, OCCS provider SMDERI-QET, STS service provider Dejin Shipping, and industrial plant operator GreenOre and its joint venture, Baorong Environmental Co. Ltd. Port authorities and regulators, namely Shanghai Municipal Transportation Commission (SMTC), Shanghai Maritime Safety Administration (SMSA), Shanghai International Port Group (SIPG), Shanghai Customs, and Shanghai Border Inspection also supported the pilot. \n  \n**Beyond the pilot**\nGCMD will conduct a comprehensive LCA to quantify GHG emissions for this pilot with CO2 quality and quantity data obtained through sampling activities conducted throughout the pilot. GCMD will work with DNV for third-party verification of emissions reduction claims under recognised accounting frameworks.\n  \n**Spokespeople quotes:**  \nProfessor Lynn Loo, CEO of GCMD, said, “We are proud to leverage our role as a neutral convener to bring together stakeholders from various sectors to address the technical and operational challenges of offloading and utilisation of CO2 captured onboard vessels. This pilot marks a major step in demonstrating how onboard captured CO2 can be integrated into the broader circular economy. With a rigorous life cycle assessment underway, we are quantifying the climate impact across the entire value chain to show how OCCS can serve as a meaningful decarbonisation lever—when applied thoughtfully and transparently.”\n  \nDr. Su Yi, General Manager of SMDERI-QET, said, “As the developer of the world’s first complete OCCS process, we are honoured to collaborate with all parties in the successful completion of the world’s first ship-to-ship transfer of LCO2. Since the delivery of the first full-process OCCS in early 2024, we have executed two successful ship-to-shore unloading operations and achieved the world’s first CII deduction for vessels. From ship-to-shore unloading to ship-to-ship transfer, we are confident that this milestone – coupled with further advancements in OCCS – will not only accelerate the development of a global network for shore-based carbon storage and utilisation facilities, but also advance the decarbonisation of the shipping industry.”\n  \nTracy Chen, Senior Vice President of GREENORE, said: “We are honoured to serve as the end user of the onboard captured liquefied CO2 in this initiative led by GCMD. By converting the LCO2 into high-purity, green calcium carbonate, we have helped complete the carbon value chain in this pilot. GREENORE is committed to driving substantial reductions in shipping emissions. In the future, with the launch of GREENORE’s coastal mineralisation projects, onboard captured LCO2 can be locally utilised and stored—enabling meaningful emissions abatement and supporting the maritime sector’s transition to net-zero.”"

Those aiming for net zero targets by 2030 are now entering the phase in which they must deal with hard-to-abate emissions, which often means incorporating carbon removals. In Q2, the most significant of the entities working to concretely address hard-to-abate emissions through carbon removal action was Microsoft – by a mile.\nMicrosoft made waves, signing massive, market-moving CDR deals that broke records and swept the top four biggest engineered transactions of the quarter. While these deals signal confidence in the engineered CDR market, validation for specific removal pathways, and a continued commitment to emissions reduction, they also shine a light on a growing limitation of the market: the risk associated with one company dominating deals.\n**Q2 2025 Insight #1: BECCS Accelerates Back to First Place – and Breaks Records**\n[Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)](https://elimini.com/beccs) has firmly established itself as the cornerstone of engineered carbon removals. Driven by [Microsoft’s deal with AtmosClear](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fidelis-atmosclear-signs-agreement-with-microsoft-for-high-quality-carbon-removal-from-project-in-louisiana-302428296.html), BECCS represented the lion’s share of market volume in Q2, now making up an astounding 74% of all-time engineered CDRs transacted.\nThis dominance makes sense: BECCS offers high permanence, scalable deployment, and regulatory familiarity. For enterprises looking to secure high-volume, verifiable, and financeable removal portfolios, BECCS is emerging as the default solution.\n**Q2 2025 Insight #2: The Biggest Engineered CDR Deals in VCM History... Twice**\nLast quarter, the record for the Voluntary Carbon Market’s (VCM) largest engineered CDR deal to date was broken not once, but twice – both times by Microsoft. This substantive commitment by Microsoft underscores the role that just one determined buyer can play in shaping the direction of the entire sector.\nMicrosoft’s headlining purchase transactions included:\n  * [6.75 million tonnes](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fidelis-atmosclear-signs-agreement-with-microsoft-for-high-quality-carbon-removal-from-project-in-louisiana-302428296.html) of BECCS from AtmosClear\n  * [3.69 million tonnes](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/co280-signs-landmark-3-69-million-tonne-agreement-with-microsoft-to-scale-up-carbon-dioxide-removal-in-the-us-pulp-and-paper-industry-302426170.html) of BECCS from CO280\n  * [1.75 million tonnes](https://beccs.se/news/stockholm-exergi-extends-landmark-carbon-removal-agreement-with-microsoft/) of BECCS from Stockholm Exergi\n  * [1.25 million tonnes](https://www.exomadgreen.com/post/exomad-green-announces-world-s-largest-biochar-carbon-removal-agreement-with-microsoft-tracked-by-c) of biochar from Exomad Green\n  * [1.1 million tonnes](https://carboncapturemagazine.com/articles/hafslund-celsio-announces-a-10-year-carbon-removal-agreement-with-microsoft) of BECCS from Hafslund Celsio\n\nMicrosoft now accounts for nine of the top 10 largest engineered CDR deals ever recorded, solidifying its position as an apex player in the market.\nThese double record-breaking transactions dominated headlines in Q2, turning the eyes of the whole CDR market toward the company and its preferred CDR pathways. Carbon removal developers will increasingly be looking to appeal to Microsoft to secure high-volume deals that can anchor their projects.\nMicrosoft’s leadership in carbon removal has been instrumental in stimulating early market growth. With the resources to evaluate emerging technologies and the confidence to make bold investments, Microsoft is setting a powerful precedent. \nAt the same time, Microsoft’s outsized role underscores how important it is for more companies to follow suit. As a pioneer in this space, Microsoft is uniquely positioned to both continue to lead and help bring others along – sharing insights, identifying best practices, and inspiring confidence in the industry – which can accelerate broader market participation to support engineered CDR projects as a viable path to achieving emission reduction and net zero targets.\nIn particular, Microsoft clearly outlines its sustainability goals and progress via its annual [Environmental Sustainability Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability/report/) – and if more buyers provided this level of direction, it would help the market focus development resources accordingly. Variety in buyers would help to underpin the development of a growing industry and bring to scale diverse products to support corporate needs and preferences. And for potential customers, now is a prime time to invest in the market to ensure projects have anchor funding needed to get built – so CDRs are available when they’re needed most. This is a critical requirement for BECCS projects in particular. \nThe good news: as engineered removals prove their credibility and first movers blaze the trail, more purchasers can have the confidence to join in.\n**Q2 2025 Insight #3: Biochar Surpasses DAC**\nAnother major shift in the removal landscape was biochar overtaking direct air capture (DAC) as the second-largest engineered removal pathway measured by contracted volume. This leap was powered largely by Microsoft’s deal with Exomad Green, but it reflects a broader pattern of confidence in biochar’s scalability, durability, and affordability. Biochar is on a progressive upswing, building on gains from [Q1 2025](https://elimini.com/news/key-insights-from-the-vcm-q1-2025) that were driven by investments like Google’s deals with Charm Industrial and Varaha, as well as [YOY growth in 2024](https://elimini.com/news/key-insights-from-the-2024-voluntary-carbon-market).\nWith a rising number of credible biochar suppliers and long-term offtake agreements coming online, the sector is poised to offer another formidable biogenic carbon solution alongside BECCS to help round out diversified CDR portfolios.\nThe second quarter of 2025 redefined what’s possible for carbon removals. It proved that, even amid economic and regulatory uncertainty, engineered removals are becoming a central pillar of corporate climate strategies and engineered CDRs are on a path to transition from breakthrough to baseline, establishing carbon removals as routine and reliable."

    "date": "September 4, 2025",
    "author": "Block Energy",
    "content": "Block Energy PLC, the development and production company focused on Georgia, is pleased to announce that it has completed its initial injection of CO2 as part of the Carbon Capture Storage (\"CCS\") project.\nHighlights:\n  * CO2 injection operations were successfully and safely executed.\n  * Liquid CO2 was delivered to the wellsite by Block's partner on the pilot study, Rustavi Azot (a subsidiary of Indorama Corporation) and injected in solution with water.\n  * Previous work has confirmed connectivity between the injector well (PAT-49) and the four monitoring wells (PAT-15, PAT-92, PAT-95 and PAT-139).\n  * No CO2 leakage on surface was detected following the injection.\n  * Comprehensive monitoring and verification programme in place with the aim of proving mineralisation of CO2 in the reservoir.\n  * First successful pilot test of its kind in the broader Eastern European region.\n  * Provides pathway to project commercialisation opportunities.\n\nCommenting, Paul Haywood, Block Energy Chief Executive Officer said:\n\"We are proud to have delivered the region's first successful CO2 mineralisation injection pilot, having done so through our own cash resources. This represents an important milestone for Block, Georgia and our partner on the pilot project, Indorama, as we seek to demonstrate the viability of large-scale, low-cost CCS. This pilot injection paves the way for commercial engagement with industrial partners and carbon markets and we now look forward to building on this success.\"\nCommenting, Prakash Kejriwal, Group Director of Indorama Corporation said:\n\"We are pleased to highlight that the first CO₂ mineralisation project in Georgia has been successfully implemented with the support of Rustavi Azot Indorama. This pilot provides valuable insights into how carbon capture and mineralisation can be applied on an industrial scale, helping reduce emissions and align with future EU carbon regulations. As one of the country's largest industrial producers, it demonstrates our potential to be at the forefront of advanced carbon management technologies while strengthening our competitiveness in global markets. This milestone also reflects Indorama Corporation's broader commitment to reducing its environmental footprint and advancing sustainable industrial practices across all our production sites worldwide.\"\nInjection Operation:\nThis update is further to the announcements of 14 April 2025 and 12 August 2025. During the pilot injection, a total of 13.6 tonnes of liquid CO2 was injected into the reservoir along with 300m3 of water and sodium fluorescence tracer at pressures of 120 - 130 bar. Following data review, it is likely that injection rates will be optimised providing the potential to increase per-well injection capacity.\nNo CO2 was detected at surface during or immediately following the injection, with sampling occurring on the injection well and the monitoring wells prior, during and after the injection.\nThe original study by Oilfield Production Consultants (OPC) (2023) into the storage capacity at Patardzueli-Samgori ascribed a total volume of 151.5 Mt in the mid case.\nPilot and Next Steps:\nThe successful injection of CO2 is the first mineralisation project of its kind in the broader Eastern European region and positions Block as a first-mover in the space.\nA detailed monitoring and verification plan is in place and underway in which the Company will collect subsurface samples and analyse data to determine if the injected CO2 has mineralised into solid calcium carbonate (and therefore be permanently stored). Unlike 'conventional' carbon storage technology, the CO2 is converted in the reservoir through reactions in the reservoir minerals into solid rock and therefore the requirement for high-cost monitoring and verification procedures (such as 4D seismic) is not required.\nPre-injection work including subsurface rock sampling analysis, determination of pressure communication and dye tracer analysis between the injector well and the monitoring wells was completed, giving confidence in the Company's ability to determine if the CO2 has mineralised as forecast.\nIt is expected that it will take 4-6 months to determine if the CO2 has successfully mineralised in the reservoir and therefore proceed to the next steps in the project.\nAssuming that mineralisation is proven from the pilot, then this will provide a credible and tangible pathway to commercialisation opportunities through third-party verification and a solution to carbon emissions reduction within Georgia and potentially the wider region.\nCommercial efforts are currently focused on direct air capture technologies as well as engagement with industrial emitters seeking carbon reduction solutions, including in response to the EU's upcoming Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. Georgia and the EU have a zero-tariff free-trade agreement in place, offering additional opportunities to this route.\nWork is ongoing on commercialisation options, including discussions with Indorama Corporation, as well as work on field scale development scenarios."

    "content": "U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a public comment period on its intent to issue a permit for Marquis Carbon Injection LLC to inject and store carbon dioxide underground at an injection well in Putnam County, Illinois.\nThe process of storing carbon underground is known as “carbon sequestration.” Under the proposed plan, Marquis Carbon Injection would inject up to 1.5 million metric tons of carbon per year, over a period of six years. Marquis would be required to monitor the wells—during the six years of proposed injection and for twelve years afterwards—to ensure that the injection wells work properly, the carbon dioxide does not move from its injected location and drinking water sources are protected.\nThe formation where carbon will be stored is approximately 3,094 feet below ground. Studies of the site show that there is about 963 feet of rock, including a 404-foot-thick confining zone composed of impermeable shale and carbonates, between the deepest underground source of drinking water and the proposed injection location. EPA has concluded that the well materials, intended operation of the well, and underlying geology are appropriate for carbon sequestration and will prevent endangerment of underground drinking water sources.\nEPA will host a public availability session on October 15 to engage in conversation and answer questions on the draft permit and a public hearing on October 29 to hear and record public comments. Comments may also be submitted in writing. \n**Public Availability Session Information:**\n  * When: Wednesday, October 15\n  * Time: 6 to 8 p.m. CT\n  * Where: Putnam County High School in the Media Room  \n400 East Silverspoon Ave.  \nGranville, Illinois\n\n**Public Hearing Information:**\n  * When: Wednesday, October 29\n  * Time: 6 to 8 p.m. CT\n  * Where: Putnam County High School in the Auditorium   \n400 East Silverspoon Ave.  \nGranville, Illinois\n\nEPA’s public comment period will end on November 3.

    "content": "Marking a major milestone in the development of commercial-scale geological storage of CO2 in Europe to combat climate change, Carbfix has on 30 April received a storage permit for its injection site at Hellisheiði, Iceland, from the Environment and Energy Agency of Iceland. \nThe permit allows for storage of up to 106,000 tons of captured CO2 annually, for a total of 3.2 million tons over 30 years. \nThis is the first permit ever issued for onshore geological storage of CO2 in Europe under the EU’s Directive on Geological Storage of CO2 (the CCS Directive). Since the Directive’s adoption in 2009, only a handful of storage permits have been issued, and all apply to offshore projects. \nCarbfix started pilot injections of CO2 at Hellisheiði in 2012, testing a proprietary method to inject dissolved CO2 into porous basaltic rock formations deep underground for permanent mineralization. Subsequent studies showed that the CO2 did indeed mineralize within two years through natural reactions and is thus safely and permanently stored. \nCarbfix has successfully applied this method to store almost 100,000 tons of captured CO2 at the site. Under the CCS Directive, the requirement for a storage permit does not apply to storage below 100,000 tons for R&D purposes and testing of new processes. \nCarbfix stores CO2 from two sources that are located at the site: ON Power’s geothermal power plant, which is among the world’s largest, and Climeworks’ two direct air capture plants, the larger of which is the world’s largest direct air capture facility in operation. With the permit in place, it is now possible to capture and store all CO2 emissions of the Hellisheiði Power Plant. \nCarbfix is the first company to mineralize CO₂ underground on a commercial scale. The company is working towards utilizing the enormous storage potential of basaltic rock formations on a larger scale by developing Coda Terminal, a planned mineral storage hub in Iceland aiming for a capacity to store 3 million tons a year. \nGeological storage of captured CO2 is a necessary addition to other efforts in the fight against climate change. In recognition of this, the recent “Net Zero Industry Act” set an annual injection capacity target for the EU of 50 million tons by 2030. \nThe scale-up of CO2 capture and storage at Hellisheiði has been achieved with the participation of ON Power, Carbfix, and the European Innovation Fund, which provided a €3.9 million grant for the project. The collaboration was under the project name Silverstone, referring to the Icelandic name of a particular variety of the calcium carbonate that forms when CO₂ reacts with basaltic rock formations. \nEdda Sif Pind Aradóttir, CEO of Carbfix: _\"This is a major milestone and an important step in the company’s growth toward having a truly positive impact on climate change. Every step matters and this permit places ON Power’s plant at the forefront of the global geothermal sector. With this first onshore storage permit in Europe, Iceland also retains a certain leadership role in building a new industry that is essential to both the EU’s and IPCC’s climate goals.\"_  _The project is supported by the European Union.

    "author": "Danielle Piekarski",
    "content": "As the CCUS industry faces ongoing uncertainty, with economic challenges and evolving regulatory landscapes, one thing remains clear: The drive for scalable decarbonization is unwavering. Despite these hurdles, we continue to adapt and innovate, forging ahead with determination. Whether it be through technological diversification, enhanced safety measures, or improved monitoring solutions, we remain on course, ready to meet the global demand for sustainable, long-term carbon reduction.  \n  \nWe start by looking up, quite literally, to Canada, where Bonnie Drozdowski of InnoTech Alberta outlines the province’s efforts to remain competitive in an increasingly uncertain economic environment. Alberta’s energy industry is at a crossroads, where reducing emissions without sacrificing productivity is paramount. On page 5, Drozdowski emphasizes the importance of diversifying carbon capture technologies to lower costs and boost industry adoption. Alberta’s recent funding initiative to enhance carbon capture technology reflects a clear recognition of the need for more cost-effective solutions and how expanding the options available for CCUS will keep business competitive, ensuring that they have the tools necessary to significantly reduce their emissions over time.  \n  \nBuilding on the theme of innovation, we turn to page 8, where Dr. Glenn Wilson of Halliburton examines the company’s breakthrough work in injectivity monitoring. Halliburton’s deployment of fiber optic sensing and acoustic-based monitoring technologies is transforming the way CO2 injection is measured in underground reservoirs. By capturing real-time data, Halliburton’s technology allows for more precise understanding of CO2 migration, which is essential for optimizing plume modeling and enhancing the effectiveness of carbon storage operations. Reports show that the public’s top concern of CCUS is safety, and this level of monitoring will ensure that injection operations are safer, more efficient, and more reliable.  \n  \nOn page 10, we delve into Twelve’s work on carbon transformation technologies, which represent a game-changing shift in how we think about carbon emissions. Twelve is leading efforts to convert CO2 into valuable products like fuels, chemicals and materials using electrolysis. This emerging approach to carbon utilization not only helps capture carbon but also puts it to productive use, thus accelerating the transition to a circular carbon economy. By expanding the potential uses of captured CO2, Twelve is providing an innovative path toward achieving sustainability goals while simultaneously creating economic value.  \n  \nWhen focusing on carbon dioxide removals, it is important to address the voluntary carbon market (VCM). On page 14, we focus on carbon removal through bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. This growing market is shaping the future of carbon removal strategies, as industries seek to offset emissions and meet sustainability targets. The article sheds light on how the VCM is evolving, and how it offers both challenges and opportunities for companies aiming to participate in carbon removal initiatives.  \n  \nFinally, we bring it right back to the public’s top concern—safety. The importance of pipeline safety in the growing CCUS infrastructure landscape cannot be overstated. As Dave Elam from TRC Environmental Corp. emphasizes on page 18, transporting captured CO2 over long distances presents a significant challenge, requiring robust regulatory frameworks and innovative monitoring solutions. His insight highlight the need for safe, well-regulated pipelines to ensure the scalability of CCUS projects and maintain public trust as these technologies expand.  \nAs we look to the future, the path forward for CCUS may still be filled with challenges, but our collective adaptability, innovation and commitment to decarbonization will guide us. By embracing new technologies, strengthening safety measures and fostering collaboration, we are building a foundation for scalable, long-term solutions."

    "content": "STAX Engineering is building momentum in the UK market, participating in a consortium that secured £1.1 million (US$1.5 million) in government funding led by carbon capture startup Seabound for its first major European project. The maritime emissions capture and control pioneer has been awarded the grant through the UK Department for Transport’s sixth round of the Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition (CMDC6) as part of “PortZero,” a four-company consortium with Seabound, port operator Associated British Ports (ABP), and Lomar Shipping.\nThe PortZero project—”Enabling Zero-Emission Ports via Carbon and Air Pollution Capture from Berthed Vessels”—tackles one of the maritime industry’s most pressing challenges: decarbonizing port operations while improving air quality in port communities. By integrating Seabound’s carbon capture technology onto STAX’s proven emissions capture and control barge, the project will demonstrate how ports can achieve comprehensive emissions reductions without costly vessel retrofits or new infrastructure investments. The solution provides a practical, cost-effective alternative to shore power installations, which require significant upfront capital, aren’t viable for all vessel types, and remain largely unbuilt—with major European ports having installed or commissioned [only 20%](https://www.eunews.it/en/2025/07/16/maritime-transport-te-study-urges-dock-electrification-to-cut-emissions-from-docked-ships/) required by EU regulations.\n“This project validates what we’ve known for years—ports need emissions solutions that work today without the infrastructure disruptions caused by solutions like shore power,” said Mike Walker, CEO of STAX Engineering. “The UK government’s investment in PortZero proves there’s real demand for technology that delivers immediate results without forcing ports to choose between operational efficiency and environmental responsibility. Our message is simple: clean air can’t wait, and with this technology, it doesn’t have to.”\nThe Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition is designed to accelerate the development of clean maritime technologies and infrastructure in the UK. Funded through the UK Government’s £236 million UK SHORE (Shipping Office for Reducing Emissions) programme and delivered by Innovate UK, CMDC6 committed more than £30 million across 71 projects focused on maritime decarbonization and smart shipping.\n“Sustainability and innovation are key themes as ABP helps its customers to adapt to the changing environment” said Max Harris, Head of Strategy and Sustainability at Associated British Ports. “We are excited to explore the potential of this innovative solution as we pursue ever better air quality at our ports and support maritime decarbonisation”.\nSTAX and Seabound offer the first fully integrated emissions solution that is immediate, requiring no retrofits or expensive overhauls. STAX’s mobile barge captures up to 99% of particulate matter (PM) and 95% of nitrogen oxides (NOx), while Seabound’s unit isolates and stores up to 95% of carbon dioxide and 90% of sulfur emissions. The system will debut at ABP’s Southampton port with vessels from UK-based Lomar Shipping.\nPortZero expands upon the successful[ Carbon Capture Showcase](https://www.staxengineering.com/stax-hub/stax-engineering-seabound-first-integrated-emissions-carbon-capture-solution/) from April 2025, where the combined STAX-Seabound solution was first debuted and highlights [collaboration with ABP](https://www.staxengineering.com/stax-hub/uk-us-collaboration-for-zero-emissions-at-port-with-first-ever-integrated-solution/), demonstrating growing momentum for addressing port emissions globally."

    "date": "May 29, 2025",
    "author": "David L. Chandler, MIT News",
    "content": "Removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere efficiently is often seen as a crucial need for combatting climate change, but systems for removing carbon dioxide suffer from a tradeoff. Chemical compounds that efficiently remove CO₂ from the air do not easily release it once captured, and compounds that release CO₂ efficiently are not very efficient at capturing it. Optimizing one part of the cycle tends to make the other part worse.\nNow, using nanoscale filtering membranes, researchers at MIT have added a simple intermediate step that facilitates both parts of the cycle. The new approach could improve the efficiency of electrochemical carbon dioxide capture and release by six times and cut costs by at least 20 percent, they say.\nThe new findings are [reported today in the journal _ACS Energy Letters_](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c00893), in a paper by MIT doctoral students Simon Rufer, Tal Joseph, and Zara Aamer, and professor of mechanical engineering Kripa Varanasi.\n“We need to think about scale from the get-go when it comes to carbon capture, as making a meaningful impact requires processing gigatons of CO₂,” says Varanasi. “Having this mindset helps us pinpoint critical bottlenecks and design innovative solutions with real potential for impact. That’s the driving force behind our work.”\nMany carbon-capture systems work using chemicals called hydroxides, which readily combine with carbon dioxide to form carbonate. That carbonate is fed into an electrochemical cell, where the carbonate reacts with an acid to form water and release carbon dioxide. The process can take ordinary air with only about 400 parts per million of carbon dioxide and generate a stream of 100 percent pure carbon dioxide, which can then be used to make fuels or other products.\nBoth the capture and release steps operate in the same water-based solution, but the first step needs a solution with a high concentration of hydroxide ions, and the second step needs one high in carbonate ions. “You can see how these two steps are at odds,” says Varanasi. “These two systems are circulating the same sorbent back and forth. They’re operating on the exact same liquid. But because they need two different types of liquids to operate optimally, it’s impossible to operate both systems at their most efficient points.”\nThe team’s solution was to decouple the two parts of the system and introduce a third part in between. Essentially, after the hydroxide in the first step has been mostly chemically converted to carbonate, special nanofiltration membranes then separate ions in the solution based on their charge. Carbonate ions have a charge of 2, while hydroxide ions have a charge of 1. “The nanofiltration is able to separate these two pretty well,” Rufer says.\nOnce separated, the hydroxide ions are fed back to the absorption side of the system, while the carbonates are sent ahead to the electrochemical release stage. That way, both ends of the system can operate at their more efficient ranges. Varanasi explains that in the electrochemical release step, protons are being added to the carbonate to cause the conversion to carbon dioxide and water, but if hydroxide ions are also present, the protons will react with those ions instead, producing just water.\n“If you don’t separate these hydroxides and carbonates,” Rufer says, “the way the system fails is you’ll add protons to hydroxide instead of carbonate, and so you’ll just be making water rather than extracting carbon dioxide. That’s where the efficiency is lost. Using nanofiltration to prevent this was something that we aren’t aware of anyone proposing before.”\nTesting showed that the nanofiltration could separate the carbonate from the hydroxide solution with about 95 percent efficiency, validating the concept under realistic conditions, Rufer says. The next step was to assess how much of an effect this would have on the overall efficiency and economics of the process. They created a techno-economic model, incorporating electrochemical efficiency, voltage, absorption rate, capital costs, nanofiltration efficiency, and other factors.\nThe analysis showed that present systems cost at least $600 per ton of carbon dioxide captured, while with the nanofiltration component added, that drops to about $450 a ton. What’s more, the new system is much more stable, continuing to operate at high efficiency even under variations in the ion concentrations in the solution. “In the old system without nanofiltration, you’re sort of operating on a knife’s edge,” Rufer says; if the concentration varies even slightly in one direction or the other, efficiency drops off drastically. “But with our nanofiltration system, it kind of acts as a buffer where it becomes a lot more forgiving. You have a much broader operational regime, and you can achieve significantly lower costs.”\nHe adds that this approach could apply not only to the direct air capture systems they studied specifically, but also to point-source systems — which are attached directly to the emissions sources such as power plant emissions — or to the next stage of the process, converting captured carbon dioxide into useful products such as fuel or chemical feedstocks. Those conversion processes, he says, “are also bottlenecked in this carbonate and hydroxide tradeoff.”\nIn addition, this technology could lead to safer alternative chemistries for carbon capture, Varanasi says. “A lot of these absorbents can at times be toxic, or damaging to the environment. By using a system like ours, you can improve the reaction rate, so you can choose chemistries that might not have the best absorption rate initially but can be improved to enable safety.”\nVaranasi adds that “the really nice thing about this is we’ve been able to do this with what’s commercially available,” and with a system that can easily be retrofitted to existing carbon-capture installations. If the costs can be further brought down to about $200 a ton, it could be viable for widespread adoption. With ongoing work, he says, “we’re confident that we’ll have something that can become economically viable” and that will ultimately produce valuable, saleable products.\nRufer notes that even today, “people are buying carbon credits at a cost of over $500 per ton. So, at this cost we’re projecting, it is already commercially viable in that there are some buyers who are willing to pay that price.” But by bringing the price down further, that should increase the number of buyers who would consider buying the credit, he says. “It’s just a question of how widespread we can make it.” Recognizing this growing market demand, Varanasi says, “Our goal is to provide industry scalable, cost-effective, and reliable technologies and systems that enable them to directly meet their decarbonization targets.”\nThe research was supported by Shell International Exploration and Production Inc. through the MIT Energy Initiative, and the U.S. National Science Foundation, and made use of the facilities at MIT.nano."

    "content": "s Brazil prepares to host the United Nations’ COP30, the Society for Low Carbon Technologies (SFLCT) is collaboratively involved in the country’s preparations as part of the Ministério de Minas e Energia (MME), a Brazilian government ministry, and its newly launched Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) Subcommittee, with participants shown in the opening image. This is particularly significant as Brazil enacted South America’s first carbon capture and storage (CCS) framework in 2024, which the SFLCT played a collaborative role in shaping, through the Fuel of the Future law, with Presidential backing.\n\"At COP29 in Azerbaijan, we demonstrated our institutional prowess by engaging the World Bank to tackle Pakistan's smog and decarbonization. Brazil further extends the global south impact arc” _— Fernando C. Hernandez_\nWhat began at COP28, when SFLCT’s leadership facilitated engagement between Brazilian entities and the U.S. Department of Energy before the law’s passage, [as featured in the \"Journal of Petroleum Technology\" (JPT),](https://jpt.spe.org/brazils-moves-toward-becoming-the-first-south-american-nation-to-pass-ccs-legislation) has now evolved into a deeper role. The Subcommittee, launched on July 14 under the Permanent Technical Committee on the Fuel of the Future, advances CCUS through Brazil’s Fuel of the Future law, anchoring the country’s stance at COP30 and beyond. Headquartered in the U.S., SFLCT operates from Panama to Pakistan, serving as a global bridge between international expertise and Brazil’s emerging CCUS framework.\n[At the Ministério de Minas e Energia’s public workshop on July 14,](https://www.youtube.com/live/q7x7AY2Su9A?feature=shared) key stakeholders from the Subcommittee, including Petrobras, Instituto Brasileiro de Petróleo e Gás, TotalEnergies, FS Energia, Innovation Norway, and Empresa de Pesquisa Energética, came together to advance carbon capture policy and implementation.\nThe global NGO, also featured in JPT, is in direct dialogue with Brazil’s regulator, Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP), a participant of this Subcommittee. A key objective of this engagement is to support Brazil’s regulatory advancement on CCUS, recognizing that ANP, Brazil’s federal hydrocarbons and biofuels regulator, now holds notable authority over the carbon capture domain and its regulations.\nThis Subcommittee equally unites stakeholders across diverse sectors to ensure that Brazil’s net-zero commitments are backed by enforceable regulations and real-world deployment. During Rio Innovation Week, the following Subcommittee participants, tying back to the opening image, met after panel sessions hosted by the ANP: Cassandra Dewan, SFLCT Strategic Advisor; Fernando C. Hernandez, SFLCT Chairman of the Board; Carlos Cabral, MME; and Janaina Ruas Filiponi, SLB New Energy. Highlighting SFLCT’s growing international role, Hernandez noted, “[At COP29 in Azerbaijan, we demonstrated our institutional prowess](https://www.einpresswire.com/article/766556994/cop29-and-society-for-low-carbon-technologies-the-next-chapter-in-international-climate-diplomacy) by engaging the World Bank to tackle Pakistan's smog and decarbonization. Brazil further extends the global south impact arc.”\nAs host nation, Brazil is home to South America’s first Direct Air Capture facility, visited by SFLCT and commissioned in late 2024. Petrobras has re-injected a record 14.2 million tons of CO2 offshore in the Santos Basin, representing nearly 28% of global CO2 storage capacity. While historically linked to Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), this milestone now signals Brazil’s technical maturity to move beyond EOR, laying the foundation for future projects focused on dedicated CO2 storage.\nFS Energia’s ethanol-to-sequestration pilot, with oversight from ANP, marks the first well in Brazil for capturing CO2 and mirrors the pathway pioneered by Archer Daniels Midland in the U.S. in 2017, which is fully operational. Importantly, SFLCT brings institutional ethanol-to-sequestration expertise through advisory member Zach Liu, whose team at Harvestone Low Carbon Partners delivered the first CCS project at a U.S. ethanol facility in 2023 following the Inflation Reduction Act, offering Brazil a proven model.\nReflecting on the Subcommittee’s role, Hernandez stated, “This unified effort positions Brazil to present at COP30 how climate diplomacy can translate into regulatory clarity, financial innovation, and technical scalability.”"

    "content": "PTTEP has reached the final investment decision (FID) on Carbon Capture and Storage Project (CCS) at the Arthit gas field. This milestone marks Thailand’s first CCS development, paving the way for the technology to play a significant role in advancing the country’s Net Zero goal.\nMr. Montri Rawanchaikul, Chief Executive Officer of PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited (PTTEP), stated that the CCS Project at Arthit gas field is Thailand’s first CCS initiative, designed to capture and store up to 1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. As Thailand’s national petroleum exploration and production company and with today’s decision, PTTEP is turning the Arthit CCS Project from vision to execution. This represents a strategic step toward applying the technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with government policy, which recognizes the project under the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) Action Plan on Mitigation 2021–2030.\n“PTTEP strives not only to safeguard the country’s energy security but also to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. CCS is an essential technology, both nationally and globally, complementing other clean energy solutions in addressing climate change. The Arthit CCS Project will serve as a pilot for cultivating expertise and driving CCS adoption in Thailand, including the Eastern CCS Hub in the Northern Gulf of Thailand, which has potential to make material contribution to the country’s Net Zero target and enhance the nation’s long-term economic competitiveness” Mr. Montri said.\nThe Arthit CCS Project has been endorsed as one of Flagship Projects for greenhouse gas emissions reduction under the NDC Action Plan, with an approved direction for the government to consider measures and granting of appropriate investment support such as tax incentives. PTTEP is working closely with relevant government agencies to ensure alignment with the country’s emission reduction objectives.\nPTTEP has conducted extensive studies and assessments in preparation for the project, covering the entire process—from storage site selection with reservoirs at depths of 1,000–2,000 meters, to engineering design, and comprehensive Measurement, Monitoring and Verification (MMV) programs. PTTEP will leverage existing infrastructure at Arthit field while constructing and installing additional facilities as required. Carbon storage operations are expected to commence in 2028, with capacity gradually ramping up to around 1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. The five-year investment is estimated at approximately THB 10 billion (equivalent to USD 320 million). Importantly, the development will not impact natural gas production at the Arthit field.\nCCS is regarded as a reverse process of petroleum exploration and production. As natural gas is extracted from underground to provide energy for national development and everyday life, the excess carbon dioxide is captured and safely injected back into its original subsurface reservoirs.\nBeyond CCS project, PTTEP has also implemented a range of initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include reusing excess gas from petroleum production processes, improving production efficiency, adopting renewable energy, and prioritizing low-carbon intensity projects within its portfolio. The company has also undertaken reforestation and mangrove planting projects to expand green areas that can help to absorb greenhouse gases substantially."

    "author": "Block Energy",
    "content": "Block Energy plc (AIM: BLOE), the production and development company focused on Georgia, announced good progress on Phase 2 of its CCS project, with the key process specific subsurface uncertainties, ahead of the pilot test, having been resolved. Work has shifted to the redesign of existing non-producing wells, and implementation of the pilot injection of CO2 into the reservoir.\nWork has been ongoing since November 2024 on Phase 2 of the CCS project. Phase 2 comprises of desktop, laboratory and field work, aimed at undertaking a pilot injection into the Patardzueli Middle Eocene reservoir, to prove mineralization and permanent storage of CO2, and therefore the feasibility of an industrial level sequestration project. The Company has sufficient cash resources to fund the pilot program in collaboration with Indorama, a major international petro-chemical company, who are Block's partners on this Project.\n**Highlights**\n·  Results from the analysis of Middle Eocene reservoir rock samples exceeded expectations. They suggest the reservoir is suitable for CO2 mineralization at depths shallower than forecast, reducing expected costs.\n·  A successful water injection test showed that well PAT-92 (an abandoned former production well) and well PAT-49 (currently used for water disposal) are in pressure communication and therefore can be used as injector and monitoring wells (critical for the monitoring and verification plan) for the pilot test.\n·  Work is ongoing to finalize the surface facility design at the PAT-49 well site as well as the monitoring and verification plan to commence injection of CO2 into the reservoir in mid-2025.\n**Commenting, Paul Haywood, Chief Executive Officer said:**\n\"_We continue to make good progress with our CCS project, with the main subsurface uncertainties now resolved. This was achieved through operational and laboratory work. The original analysis_ undertaken in [Q4 2023](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/BLOE/ccs-update/16781068) with respect _to the project's storage potential, has been validated._\n_\"We're excited for the next stage in the project, being the injection of CO 2 into the reservoir, which will occur later this year once the surface facility modifications have been completed by our engineering team and once we conclude on the methodology to be used to verify the mineralization of CO2. With the project broadly on schedule and within budget, I look forward to updating shareholders in due course.\"_\n**Phase 2 Work to Date**\nThe original study by OPC, which examined the potential for the Middle Eocene to store carbon dioxide through mineralization, was relied upon, along with logs and analogue outcrop data, to predict the presence of Zeolites (reactive minerals) within the Middle Eocene. As part of Phase 2, samples of Middle Eocene rock from two wells were analyzed by Stratum Reservoir, to further define the project and prepare for injection of carbon dioxide. The results were above expectation, with rock samples proving the reservoir suitable for CO2 mineralization at shallower depths than originally forecast, with the distribution of Zeolite concentrations relatively consistent throughout the reservoir.\nThe initial log and analogue based estimates of Zeolite concentrations had suggested that only deeper sections of the reservoir had significant concentrations of Zeolites. The laboratory rock sampling studies confirmed the initial estimates, with a mid-case 151.5 Mt CO2 storage potential, as previously announced.\nThe field monitoring and verification that CO2 is mineralized and permanently stored in the reservoir is a key milestone for defining a commercialization route. As such, Block Energy has now conducted a successful water injection test on PAT-49 (the well selected for the pilot injection of CO2) and seen a strong pressure response in PAT-92 (the well selected to monitor the CO2 mineralization process). The operation also demonstrated that water injection rates of over 5,000 barrels per day are achievable, a positive result for potential development scale storage.\nThe water injection test on PAT-49 and the preparation of PAT-92 were conducted by Block's in-house drilling and engineering team, using the Company's own A-80 rig. The Company has identified a number of other abandoned legacy wells that could be suitable for reinjection or monitoring in the future.\nFinally, a corrosion study with respect to PAT-49 has been completed with the results determining that the well is suitable for pilot injection without any downhole modifications.\n**Phase 2 Further Work**\nWith the key process specific subsurface uncertainties for the pilot test resolved, work has shifted to the design and implementation of the injection of carbon dioxide into the reservoir. CO2 will be mixed with water and pumped into PAT-49 to commence mineralization. PAT-92 will act as a monitoring/surveillance well.\nThe monitoring and verification plan for the pilot (to ensure that the carbon dioxide is sequestered as planned into solid calcium carbonate) is currently being designed. Once this is done, then injection will begin. CO2 will be supplied by Indorama, a major international petro-chemical company, who are Block's partners on this Project."

(the Consortium), are undertaking a pre-feasibility study to assess the development of Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) hubs across Asia.\nThe CCUS Hub study is the first independent industry-led study of its kind in Asia and will examine the technical and commercial pathways to utilising CCUS in hard-to-abate industries across Asia. The study will focus on the potential to develop large-scale projects which can repurpose, or store, captured carbon dioxide (CO2).\nBy leveraging shared infrastructure and economies of scale, the study will seek potential applications for captured CO2 in industrial processes, or transport captured CO2 via pipeline or shipping to storage sites in Asia or Northern Australia.\nThe plan is for each participant in the study to be included in at least one hub, and the study will deliver conceptual development strategies for each hub including cost and schedule estimates, and potential commercialisation pathways.\nThe study will also look at non-technical enablers required to make CCUS hubs a reality, for example regulatory assessments including intra and inter-regional assessments of CCUS and cross border transport.\nThe Consortium, which is open to additional members joining and contributing to the study, has appointed Hatch as Project Management Officer in collaboration with Global CCS Institute, McDaniel, and Pace CCS.\nThe study is expected to conclude at the end of 2026, with findings to be shared publicly to promote broader industry learning and support the development of enabling policy and regulatory frameworks.\nA role for CCUS is well represented in a number of external global climatic scenarios. Carbon capture technologies used in a range of existing industrial applications are relatively mature, and able to integrate with existing facilities.\nThe Consortium is prioritising the next important step – the study of scalable utilisation and storage solutions to test the potential for broader adoption to support decarbonisation, especially in regions where regulatory hurdles and market maturity limit progress.\nBy concentrating on regional hubs, the Consortium’s study will look to find ways to solve the challenge of scale by aggregating captured carbon into sufficiently large quantities to:\n• Optimise the unit cost of capture, transportation, and storage through economies-of-scale  \n• Provide sufficient scale for economic utilisation solutions  \n• Unlock novel solutions for multiple hard-to-abate industries at once, to enable regional decarbonisation efforts to be accelerated, and/or  \n• Ensure cost and risk is appropriately shared among interested parties.\n**Comment from Dr Ben Ellis, Vice President Marketing Sustainability, BHP**\n“BHP is committed to supporting our steelmaking customers on their journey to decarbonise the industry.With more than 1 billion tonnes of production a year in Asia coming from blast furnace capacity that is relatively early in its production life, it’s important for industry to progress technologies to decarbonise existing steelmaking assets while new commercial pathways to decarbonise steelmaking are developed over time.\nBy leveraging shared knowledge and resources with our partners, we are investing in support for innovative solutions—like the potential of CCUS—that we see as an essential part of decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors such as steelmaking.”\n**Comment from Dr. Arvind Bodhankar, the Chief Sustainability Officer at ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AM/NS India)**\n**Comment from Prabodha Acharya, the Chief Sustainability Officer at JSW Group**\n“Sustainability is a value that lies at the very core of JSW's Sustainability Vision that shapes the organization's strategic goals and priorities.\nWe remain committed to transforming our sustainability vision into reality with specific targets and commitments.

    "content": "Nuada has developed a solution to capture industrial carbon emissions before they enter the atmosphere, targeting sectors such as cement, lime, and waste-to-energy. Compared to traditional methods, Nuada’s technology is more efficient and cost-effective, requiring 90 per cent less energy than conventional approaches. The system passes industrial emissions through a sponge-like metal-organic framework (MOF) sorbent material, which selectively adsorbs CO₂ molecules. A vacuum process is then used to efficiently extract the captured CO₂, without the need for large-scale chemical plants or complex infrastructure.\nConventional carbon capture methods rely on energy-intensive processes and require large, capital-heavy installations. Their complexity and infrastructure demands make carbon capture deployment costly and disruptive for industrial emitters/sites. In contrast, Nuada’s approach has the potential to eliminate the need for large chemical processing systems, offering a compact, easy-to-integrate and lower-energy solution suitable for widespread industrial deployment.\n[The pilot forms part of a project awarded funding via the CCUS Innovation 2.0 programme](https://nuadaco2.com/nuada-project-waste-to-energy/), as part of the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero’s £1 billion Net Zero Innovation Portfolio.\nVisitors from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, and Nuada’s investors recently viewed the pilot plant in operation and heard more about the company’s progress.\nA video of Nuada Scout in operation is [available here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nuadaco2_carboncapture-ccus-decarbonisation-activity-7330883010516385792-jnBt).\nKey outcomes from the _Nuada Scout_ pilot include:\n  * Capture of 1 tonne per day of CO₂ from energy-from-waste and biomass flue gas\n  * Stable MOF-VPSA operation demonstrated at pilot scale\n  * Validation of platform performance across both biomass and cement applications\n\n_“With this second successful pilot, Nuada is ready to move from demonstration to commercial-scale deployment. Our low-energy, compact system removes the cost and integration complexity barriers that have long held back industrial carbon capture,”_ said Conor Hamill, co-CEO at Nuada. _“Carbon capture must move from aspiration to implementation. This pilot proves that Nuada’s technology is ready to meet that challenge practically, affordably and at scale.”_\nNuada’s [MOF-VPSA technology](https://nuadaco2.com/technology/) requires up to 90% less energy than conventional carbon capture systems offering a scalable, low-energy, and cost-effective solution that can be installed “end of pipe.” By reducing costs and easing integration, it lowers barriers to CCUS investment, making large-scale industrial decarbonisation more viable and speeding up progress toward net zero."

    "date": "August 6, 2025",
    "author": "earth4Earth",
    "content": "The sustainable materials developer, earth4Earth, has created a range of bricks that capture and permanently store carbon dioxide. \nThe bricks use Direct Air Capture (DAC) to extract CO2 from the air. This means buildings can be transformed into carbon sinks, just by using different bricks. \nThe first batch of bricks is now available in the UK, where they are being used in a range of pilot projects. \nThe bricks are made using excavated soil, which would otherwise go to landfill, combined with a unique earth4Earth (e4E) binder that enhances their durability and mechanical properties. The production of binders traditionally releases high levels of CO2 into the atmosphere. But earth4Earth has developed technology which drastically reduces the related CO2 emissions needed to make their binder and earth bricks. \n“The binder is incredibly unique”, said Professor Theodore Hanein, Co-founder of earth4Earth. \n“As with most traditional binders, ours is lime based. Lime is typically produced by heating limestone at temperatures of around 1,000C. Traditional production generates CO2 emissions from both the breakdown of the raw materials and the fossil fuels needed to achieve the high temperatures required. \n“We have developed a unique lime production process that can be done at room temperature. \n“All of the carbon produced during the manufacture of the e4E binder is also permanently stored in a solid form, rather than being released into the atmosphere as CO2. \n“We are incredibly excited about how our work is going to help construction projects achieve net zero, and the huge difference it will make in restoring planetary health.” \nThe binder in the bricks captures and stores atmospheric CO2 quickly through a carbonation reaction. Once it is absorbed, the carbon further enhances the materials' properties. \nThe bricks are fully recyclable, as they can be crushed and made into new bricks or returned to the earth for crop growth at end-of-life. The carbon stays in the crushed material as it is chemically bound in the form of stable carbonates. \nearth4Earth has developed a range of products to suit different requirements. There are N10, N20 and N30 bricks, which contain 10%, 20% and 30% of the e4E binder. As the percentage of the binder increases, so does the level of carbon absorption. Brick L10 also captures carbon but is made using conventionally produced lime, whilst L0 is an earth-based brick with no binder. \ne4E was inspired by the Fujian Tulou, or earth buildings, found in China. They are made from rammed earth and other natural materials such as stone and wood. These buildings have stood for hundreds of years, withstanding even earthquakes and typhoons. They are naturally well-ventilated and provide excellent indoor air quality. \nThis legacy was combined with the team’s research and unique expertise to establish the earth4Earth ethos and create construction materials that are durable, breathable and genuinely good for people and planet. \ne4E was founded in 2023 and has a Research and Development Centre in Sheffield and a factory in Wuhan, China. The manufacturing process was developed in China because of the company’s connections there and the time and cost savings. Now that the production line has been established, the bricks can be made anywhere and earth4Earth plans to begin production in the UK next year, creating at least 30 more jobs locally. \nLei Zhang, Director and Co-founder of earth4Earth, said: “We are planning to develop other types of brick and materials using the e4E binder in the future too. We want to provide practical solutions to the decarbonisation of the construction industry, and we believe that high-quality materials with a range of eco-credentials will deliver this. \n\"It has been great to collaborate with others on our journey, and we are keen to hear from anyone who would be interested in joining us to scale this innovative solution further.\""

    "content": "OCOchem, a rapidly scaling pioneer of CO2 electrolysis and conversion technologies, today announced a production partnership agreement with ADM (NYSE: ADM), a global leader in innovative solutions from nature, to build a groundbreaking field demonstration plant using OCOchem’s Carbon FluX Electrolyzer technology. The plant will be co-located within ADM’s corn processing complex in Decatur, Illinois. It will convert biogenic CO2 from ADM’s ethanol production stream to formate molecules, which can be used in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products and applications.\n“The partnership with ADM will help enable OCOchem to bring our CO2 Electrolysis process to a commercial scale and start meeting early customer demand for our carbon-negative, biogenic, sustainable formate products at competitive market prices” said Todd Brix, Co-Founder and CEO of OCOchem.\n“We’re pleased to work with OCOchem to advance a high-potential pathway for converting captured CO2 into valuable, carbon-negative molecules. OCOchem has rapidly scaled an impressive CO2 conversion technology that aligns with ADM’s strategy to lead in industrial carbon management and sustainable molecule production. This collaboration represents a strategic step in demonstrating how CO2-derived formates can emerge as cost-competitive, next-generation C1 platform chemical — supporting lower-carbon supply chains and unlocking new value across the bio-based economy.” **Kris Lutt, President of Sustainable Materials and Strategic Initiatives at ADM**\nCO2 is the most abundant and readily available form of carbon for making organic molecules. Plants have been engaged in this process for an estimated 2.5 billion years. OCOchem’s technology now makes it cost-effective to convert captured CO2 into carbon-negative organic molecules directly using the highly efficient CO2 electrolysis technologies OCOchem has pioneered. “The production partnership with ADM will help enable OCOchem to bring our CO2 Electrolysis process to a commercial scale and start meeting early customer demand for our carbon-negative, biogenic, sustainable formate products at competitive market prices,” said Todd Brix, Co-Founder and CEO of OCOchem.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, OCOchem will build, deploy, and operate modular Carbon FluX electrolyzer systems in an existing facility at the ADM site, converting water and CO2 captured from the bioethanol plant into carbon-negative formate molecules to replace existing fossil fuel-based formates and derivatives. Plant construction is expected to commence later this year and is scheduled for completion by the end of 2026.\nThe companies also plan to collaborate on value chain development for formate molecules and derivatives such as formic acid, potassium formate, and ethyl formate. These will target a range of existing and emerging applications, including crop protection, biomass upgrading, fertilizers, water treatment, liquid syngas carriers, industrial solvents, cleaning products, metal recovery, de-icing chemicals, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and flavors and fragrances.\nAdds Brix: “As one of the few scaled out modular CO2 conversion facilities in the world, OCOchem’s Carbon FluX Electrolyzer will also demonstrate the economic and technical feasibility to convert large volumes of captured CO2 emissions into value-added liquid organic molecules. This will happen on-site in an existing manufacturing environment, and establish a new, fast, and modular approach to industrial symbiosis, using the most abundant waste product on the planet, CO2, as feedstock.”\nBy numbering up the world’s largest gas diffusion electrode and first-of-a-kind co-current cell design into multiple cell stacks, OCOchem’s Carbon FluX Electrolyzer converts CO2 and water into vital end-user and intermediate formate molecules and derivatives that have traditionally been made from fossil fuels. By utilizing biogenic CO2 as a feedstock and clean energy, all products are carbon negative. The core use of electrochemical processing technologies, utilizing the world’s largest CO2 electrolyzer cells measuring 1.5 m² in surface area and operating at high current densities, enables high Faradaic efficiency, high cell productivity, 100% product selectivity, and hence no waste products.\nSince opening its lab in 2020, OCOchem has scaled its gas diffusion electrode-based Carbon FluX Electrolyzer cell by a factor 1500x and quadrupled its performance to make both the world’s largest and highest performance CO2 Electrolyzer Cell. Early support for OCOchem was provided by the US Army Research Office, the US Department of Energy and ARPA-E. OCOchem recently announced the completion of a multi-cell stack pilot plant at its R&D facility in Richland, WA."

    "title": "Arbor Moves Closer to First Commercial Facility, Fueled by Frontier Deal",
    "date": "July 10, 2025",
    "author": "Frontier",
    "content": "[**Frontier**](https://frontierclimate.com/) has facilitated offtakes with Arbor, a Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) company that uses waste biomass to create clean energy while removing CO₂. Frontier buyers will pay Arbor $41 million to remove 116,000 tons of CO₂ between 2028 and 2030. BECCS is a promising carbon removal pathway because it could remove multiple gigatons of CO₂ per year by 2050 ([**source**](https://www.icef.go.jp/wp-content/themes/icef_new/pdf/roadmap/icef2020_roadmap.pdf)), while also producing low-carbon heat and electricity. These offtakes will enable the launch of Arbor’s first commercial facility and test the viability of a new, highly efficient BECCS approach for generating clean electricity and removing CO₂. The facility, located near Lake Charles, LA, is expected to become fully operational in 2028.\nArbor’s approach enables a CO₂ capture rate of over 99% and increases the efficiency of converting biomass to electricity by more than 30%—significantly higher than comparable bioenergy systems. Those advantages, as well as Arbor’s modular design, position it to substantially reduce costs while meeting the increasing demand for clean electricity, particularly for data centers. Importantly, the process doesn’t produce any exhaust or air pollution, unlike traditional bioenergy plants.\nThe process starts with converting waste biomass into syngas, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, using a new gasifier design. This gas is then sent to an oxycombustor, a specialized furnace that burns the gas with pure oxygen instead of air, producing supercritical CO₂ and water. This supercritical CO₂ drives a turbine to generate clean electricity. For every ton of CO₂ that’s removed, Arbor’s system also supplies up to 1,000 kWh of clean electricity (the average household’s monthly electricity use). What’s unique about Arbor is that it is the first carbon removal company to combine three complex processes—biomass gasification, oxycombustion, and supercritical CO₂ turbomachinery—into a single system.\n### The case for Arbor\n**Arbor’s system addresses the growing demand for clean baseload electricity**. As hyperscalers build more data centers, they need to balance their commitments to reduce emissions with the requirement for constant, dependable electricity. Arbor meets this double imperative by generating clean electricity and capturing CO₂, effectively reducing fossil fuel emissions while removing carbon from the atmosphere. Furthermore, Arbor’s system produces excess water as a byproduct of the biomass gasification and oxygen combustion process. In future projects, Arbor plans to sell this excess water for uses such as irrigation and data center cooling, minimizing the need for extra cooling water in their operations.\n**Arbor's technology can remove more CO₂ than BECCS approaches using conventional CO₂ capture technologies, such as amine solvents.** Arbor’s process burns biomass with pure oxygen, producing supercritical CO₂ and water as the main byproducts. In contrast, other approaches often use regular air, resulting in exhaust that contains various gases. This complex mix makes capturing CO₂ more costly. In contrast, Arbor's exhaust consists mainly of water and CO₂, simplifying collection and storage and enabling capture rates exceeding 99%.\n**Arbor’s process could be the lowest cost approach to BECCS.** Its compact design features an 18 MW turbine about the size of a car engine, allowing for efficient scaling and cost reductions. By integrating CO₂ capture directly with power generation, Arbor eliminates the added costs of separate capture units. This approach enables a ~10x increase in power and carbon removal for every 2-3x increase in size, potentially driving costs below $100 per ton of CO₂ removed.\n**Arbor’s project meets Frontier’s**[**sustainable biomass sourcing principles**](https://frontierclimate.com/assets/biomass-sourcing-principles.pdf). The company’s commercial facility will source biomass from thinnings of managed timber plantations, in areas where (1) the growth-to-drain ratio (the amount of biomass grown vs. harvested) is either stable or increasing, and (2) where pulp and paper mills that historically utilized these thinnings have shut down. Arbor is working with a credit issuer, Isometric, to quantify the emissions from their project so they can be deducted when calculating the net carbon removal.\nFrontier has facilitated purchases on behalf of Frontier Founding Members Stripe, Google, Shopify, and McKinsey Sustainability, as well as Autodesk, H&M Group, and Workday. Aledade, Canva, Match Group, Samsara, SKIMS, Skyscanner, Wise, and Zendesk will also participate with purchases via Frontier’s partnership with Watershed.\n**Brad Hartwig, CEO, Arbor:** “Carbon removal approaches that deliver _both_ net removal and decarbonization benefits will scale quickly. That’s what sets Arbor’s approach apart. This offtake agreement with Frontier buyers accelerates a model that removes carbon while generating the reliable, zero-emission energy our power grid needs.”\n**Hannah Bebbington, Head of Deployment, Frontier:** “We need to remove gigatons of CO₂ from the atmosphere and we need a lot more clean electricity to meet the pace of AI’s development. Though they are two separate challenges, Arbor tackles both with a single solution.”"

This initiative follows the [2023 partnership announcement](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231116159493/en/CarbonQuest-and-Daroga-Power-Partner-to-Offer-Low-Carbon-Fuel-Cell-Solution), which aims to bring “Sustainable CO2” to North American commercial, industrial, utility, and other types of emitters. This project and future joint carbon capture-as-a-service projects will be owned and operated by C2Zero, a portfolio company of SER Capital Partners, in partnership with Daroga Power.\nCarbonQuest and Daroga’s first financed project is at a beverage-industry plant in [Washington state](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250603991742/en/CarbonQuest-Enters-Food-Beverage-Industry-with-On-Site-CO2-Capture-and-Reuse-Technology). Under this model, the plant enters into a multi-year agreement with Daroga to finance CarbonQuest’s distributed carbon capture system at no upfront cost for the design, installation, and operational maintenance of the carbon capture system. This structure provides lower cost, resilient, and sustainable CO2, ensuring a reliable supply of liquid CO2 for its operations. This agreement also guarantees a minimum amount of captured CO2 for the plant each year. CarbonQuest’s Carbon Management Software (CMS) tracks in real-time the amount of CO2 captured, liquified, and sold for utilization to provide assurance and transparency.\nThis first-of-its-kind financing agreement is a significant milestone for distributed carbon capture, as it provides flexibility to emitters that cannot pay for upfront carbon emission controls, while securing a steady income stream from CO2 utilization. CarbonQuest and Daroga Power are already building on this agreement with a robust pipeline of similarly financed projects. \n“Customers in many sectors are under pressure to reduce emissions yet are concerned about paying for hardware-intensive projects with capital budgets,” said Shane Johnson, CEO of CarbonQuest. “Carbon capture-as-a-service relieves that worry while providing stable and guaranteed emission reductions over a set timeframe. Daroga Power is the right financial partner at the right time. They understand how to evaluate power generation and carbon capture investments and turn them into valuable investments that scale. We are looking forward to many more opportunities together.”\n“Daroga Power has developed and financed numerous distributed power projects globally, and carbon capture-as-a-service is a natural extension of our existing capabilities,” said Ory Moussaieff, Co-Founder of Daroga Power. “With the adaptation of CarbonQuest’s modular distributed system, we are now able to transform an overlooked resource into a valuable asset, generating financial returns with positive environmental impact.\""

    "content": "Svante Technologies Inc. (Svante) and SAMSUNG E&A announced that they have signed a joint development agreement to jointly develop a set of standardized skid-mounted modular carbon capture plants based on Svante’s novel VeloxoTherm solid sorbent-based carbon capture filter technology, leveraging Samsung’s advanced digital solutions and modularization capabilities. The agreement was signed during Svante’s Grand Opening Event, which marked the commissioning of its new commercial filter manufacturing facility in Vancouver, Canada. This is the world’s first gigafactory for Svante’s filter technology, capable of producing enough filters to capture 10 million tonnes of CO2 annually.\n‘’We are working to remove the biggest barriers to rapid deployment of industrial carbon capture by first building our world-class manufacturing facility and second by partnering with SAMSUNG E&A to reduce project execution schedule and on-site construction costs through standardized design and fabrication solutions,’’ said Claude Letourneau, President & CEO of Svante.\nSAMSUNG E&A, a total solutions provider for the global energy industry, is one of the world’s leading engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) and project management companies in the world, with an ambition to assist in the energy transition. SAMSUNG E&A’s extensive experience in executing large capital projects based on modularization and digitalization, paired with Svante’s second-generation carbon capture and removal technology, makes this collaboration an innovative, accessible solution for clients in heavy industries and the energy sector looking for engineering-based carbon management solutions.\nSAMSUNG E&A is expanding its eco-friendly business portfolio with ‘E&Able’, a solution that fosters a sustainable future through advanced technology. E&Able embodies SAMSUNG E&A’s commitment to resolving pressing societal challenges such as climate change, by swiftly securing groundbreaking technologies for its customers. It also represents the company’s mission to achieve global objectives, including carbon neutrality and the circular economy, faster. The company is accelerating the promotion of new businesses in the energy transition and eco-friendly sectors, focusing on three E&Able strategies: E&Able Low (low carbon), E&Able Zero (carbon-free), and E&Able Circle (environment).“The time is now for the CCUS industry value chain players to rethink how they approach projects to deliver them faster, more cost-effectively, and more efficiently. Undertaking multiple projects in parallel while using the same EPF contractor will greatly improve project performance”, said Hong Namkoong, President and CEO of SAMSUNG E&A. “Additionally, we have pioneered with our Engineering Data Platform (EDP)utilizing digital tools to enhance project execution efficiency, ultimately driving down schedule timelines and costs.’’\nSvante has developed a unique, environmentally responsible carbon capture and removal technology, which employs what it calls “structured adsorbent beds”, known as “filters”. The company’s filters are coated with nanoengineered solid adsorbent materials, which can capture CO2 from industrial emissions, including pulp and paper, waste-to-energy, cement, steel, fertilizer, hydrogen, and more. The company’s filter technology can also be leveraged for direct air capture (DAC), in which CO2 that has already been emitted into the atmosphere is trapped and removed from the ambient air.\n“We are looking forward to partnering with SAMSUNG E&A to deliver global commercial carbon capture projects at scale”, said Claude Letourneau, Svante’s President and CEO. “SAMSUNG E&A’s 50+ years of experience in modularization across the industrial and energy sectors will be invaluable as we continue to hyperscale our operations and filter manufacturing capacity to expand our order book.”\nOne of the objectives of this collaboration is to offer industrial customers a one-stop shop via an integrated project delivery model for carbon capture plants. SAMSUNG E&A and Svante will develop standardized advanced front-end (FEL3) engineering package deliverables. During the project execution phase, it is anticipated that SAMSUNG E&A will be the exclusive EPF supplier of skid-mounted modules for CO2 capture plants, while Svante will supply its patented carbon capture machines (contactors)and filter beds. This collaborative approach to building large industrial facilities is shown to be effective at optimizing industrial project management and performance.\nThe two companies will work together to identify, develop, and deliver commercial-scale carbon capture projects globally, ensuring heavy industries and energy producers in these regions have more viable pathways to meet their emission reduction targets.\n“This agreement will assist us in continuing to deliver world-class, environmentally responsible carbon capture plants that provide customers with both cost and schedule certainty, as well as convenient pre-engineered modules and automated data-driven engineering packages — an offering we can now provide to our clients in addition to the other unique benefits our technology brings. An integrated project delivery model means customers no longer have to rely on the traditional bid-buy transactional relationships that they’ve been forced to deal with in the past.”\n  * **Claude Letourneau, Svante’s President and CEO**"

    "content": "Last year was officially the hottest on record—as verified by NASA, the World Meteorological Organization, and the National Centers for Environmental Information—and our planet surpassed the 1.5-degree Celsius tipping point warned of in the Paris Climate Agreement for the first time. Extreme weather is becoming more frequent and has already made an imprint on 2025, with impacts ranging from the devastating wildfires in southern California and landslides in Indonesia to floods in Argentina. While reducing carbon emissions is core to combating this catastrophic trend, we need to do more.  \n  \nCarbon removal technologies offer a realistic pathway to permanently reverse legacy emissions and address carbon dioxide (CO2) released by sectors where reaching net zero is not yet feasible, giving us a fighting chance to reduce our global dependency on fossil fuels and other sources of carbon pollution. The voluntary carbon market (VCM) plays an essential role in this equation. It provides a marketplace where organizations can proactively purchase carbon removals to offset the CO2 generated by their operations—particularly for hard-to-abate industries.  \n  \nWhile the VCM is still relatively new, carbon dioxide removals (CDRs) are expected to grow in to more than $1 trillion market by 2050. To meet the growing needs of this market, it’s important to keep tabs on how customer preferences are evolving. Let’s take a look at three key insights (according to cdr.fyi) gleaned from 2024 market activity, as well as early indications from 2025 and what CDR buyers are looking for this year.\n**2024 VCM Insight No. 1: Bigger and Better - But Not Broader**  \nEngineered carbon removals, like those generated from bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) or direct air capture (DAC) technologies, are reliable, measurable, and permanent, and in 2024, the market was clearly on the same page. Engineered CDRs captured significantly more of the market and did so through larger-volume transactions.  \n  \nWhile the total number of VCM transactions dropped by 35%—mainly due to fewer transactions for DAC, enhanced weathering, and bio-oil—the total volume of engineered CDRs sold grew by an impressive 66% year-over-year. The average deal size ballooned by 155%, and 12 of the 20 biggest deals to date took place in 2024.  \n  \nWe’re seeing this trend continue into 2025, with the number of transactions for the first two months down by nearly 40% compared to the same period in 2024, but total volume sold increased exponentially, by 289%. In the same period, deal size increased again, this time by 544%. Fewer deals with higher volumes continue to be a predominant theme.\n**2024 VCM Insight No. 2: BECCS is Queen**  \nSo, what CDR technology was responsible for driving the most market growth last year? As it turns out, BECCS was the go-to solution for large-volume carbon removal purchasers and the largest driver of market growth overall.  \nIn 2024, BECCS volume rose 84% from the previous year, with transactions up 156%. In fact, three of the five biggest customer deals last year were predicated on BECCS-based carbon removals, including:  \n• Stockholm Exergi’s deal with Microsoft for 3.3 metric tons (mt) of CDRs  \n• Orsted’s deal with Microsoft for 1 mt of CDRs  \n• Orsted’s deal with Equinor for   \n0.33 mt of CDRs  \n  \nBECCS permanently removes carbon from the atmosphere, and at the same time, it generates 24/7 renewable power. This provides an additional revenue stream to the project while adding a renewable energy source to the grid in support of increasing load growth. In short, BECCS-derived removals produce scalable, high-quality CDRs and renewable energy.  \n  \nInterestingly, BECCS wasn’t the only biomass-fueled solution with increased transactions in 2024—biochar and biomass removal also saw YOY growth. This success is well-positioned to continue into 2025. For example, biofuels, which are derived from biomass, were named as one of the only preferred nonfossil fuel energy solutions in President Trump’s national energy emergency declaration, alongside hydro, geothermal and nuclear. This paves the way for additional growth, while intermittent renewables like wind and solar face new headwinds.  \nThere are indications that the policy environment will only foment this trend of biomass-based engineered carbon removal growth. While it’s too soon to say if BECCS will continue to drive similar growth in 2025, we’re already seeing the year begin with two big biochar deals: Google’s deal with Charm for 100kt of CDRs, and with Varaha for 100,000 tons of CDRs.\n**2024 VCM Insight No. 3: What Buyers Want to See**  \nFor the voluntary carbon market to continue to mature, customers need ways to increase confidence in their purchases. To accomplish this, buyers are increasingly turning to:  \n• Proven, reliable technologies like BECCS: Purchasers want to ensure their investments are truly permanent, measurable and auditable.  \n• More established suppliers: Investing in smaller, niche projects can increase risk and raise red flags during the corporate vetting process. By going with experienced providers, customers can have greater confidence that projects will reach completion and operate as planned.  \n• Offerings with greater pricing transparency and standardization: Customers want to ensure they’re landing fair market rates. As they see prices settle into consistent ranges, confidence is expected to rise.  \n  \nThe 2024 VCM and early 2025 market clearly show us that customers are increasingly turning to high-quality carbon removals—predominantly from biomass-based solutions like BECCS—and they’re willing to make larger purchases when they trust the technology and supplier. Knowledgeable developers working to responsibly develop and construct projects and provide clear insight into the quality of the product they are producing, including how those products contribute to the net zero journey, can earn customer confidence. In turn, this can help expedite the reversal of the legacy emissions warming our planet, giving us a fighting chance against climate change.\nAuthor:   \nLaura Wente, senior vice president, Commercial   \nElimini"

    "content": "Carbon dioxide has long been cast as a villain—a harmful emission to be reduced and eliminated, but CO2 is also a resource with transformative and valuable potential.  \n  \nCO2 enables new ways of manufacturing. It helps diversify hydrocarbon production right here in the U.S. It serves as a building block for sustainable fuels, chemicals and materials, reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels and creating a more circular economy. By leveraging CO2 as a feedstock, industries can drive innovation, economic growth and decarbonization at scale.\n**Reimagining Carbon: From Waste to Resource**  \nCarbon transformation represents a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize emissions. Rather than viewing CO2 as industrial waste, this innovative approach recognizes it as a valuable, and locally available resource that can be harnessed to create the materials and fuels our society depends on.  \n  \nTraditional carbon capture, utilization and storage technologies have primarily focused on sequestering CO2 underground or using it in processes like enhanced oil recovery. While these methods do reduce atmospheric carbon, they often fail to address the underlying issue: our dependence on fossil fuels for manufacturing essential products.  \n  \nCarbon transformation takes a fundamentally different approach. By using CO2 as a feedstock—a raw material that can be transformed into valuable products—this technology addresses emissions at their source while simultaneously reducing our reliance on petroleum for manufacturing.  \n  \n**The Science Behind Carbon Transformation**  \nAt the heart of carbon transformation is the process of electrolysis, which uses renewable electricity to split CO2 molecules and water. Companies like Twelve have developed proprietary technology that converts these simple inputs—carbon dioxide, water and renewable energy—into complex chemicals and fuels traditionally derived from petroleum.  \n  \nThe resulting products, known as eFuels and eChemicals, are chemically identical to their fossil-derived counterparts but come with a crucial difference: they’re produced without extracting additional carbon from the earth. Instead, they utilize carbon that's already in our atmosphere or that was going to be emitted into the atmosphere, creating a more circular carbon economy.  \n  \n“We’re taking carbon that would otherwise be emitted as a waste, and turning it into the building blocks for thousands of products we use every day,” says Nicholas Flanders, CEO of Twelve.  \n  \nTwelve’s innovative carbon transformation process relies solely on CO2, water and renewable electricity to produce synthetic aviation fuel (SAF) and other low-carbon chemicals via CO2 electrolysis. The CO2 that Twelve’s process relies on can come from a variety of sources, including from the production of ethanol. That offers unique partnership opportunities for Twelve to develop projects with the agricultural industry and bring a strong added value to ethanol producers.   \n  \nEthanol is produced from the fermentation of sugars contained in crops, and in the United States, is mostly derived from corn. One bushel of corn grain yields equal parts one-third ethanol, distillers grains (used as an animal feed or a source of renewable natural gas), and CO2. About 80% of ethanol plants today vent their CO2 to the atmosphere, thus missing the opportunity to monetize 1/3 of their feedstock output. Capturing CO2 is an additional cost for producers, which historically has only been justified when there is a local market for it, but today, those new markets are growing.\n**From Emissions to Essential Products**  \nThe implications of this technology extend far beyond simple carbon capture. Thousands of consumer and industrial products that currently rely on petrochemicals could instead be manufactured using carbon captured from CO2 emissions or even directly from the air. From plastics and textiles to jet fuel and cleaning products, carbon transformation could revolutionize supply chains across numerous industries.  \nWhat makes this approach particularly powerful is that it doesn’t require companies to completely reinvent their products or processes. The eFuels and eChemicals produced through carbon transformation can be dropped into existing manufacturing systems, allowing for a smoother transition away from fossil fuel dependence.  \n“We’re not asking businesses to throw out decades of investment in their production infrastructure,” explains Youssef Tazi, CO2 business development manager at Twelve. “We're offering them a way to make the same products they always have, but with a carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative footprint.”  \n  \n**Building a Circular Carbon Economy**  \nPerhaps most exciting is the potential for carbon transformation to help establish a truly circular carbon economy. Rather than the linear “extract, use, discard” model that has dominated industrial production for centuries, carbon transformation enables a cycle where CO2 becomes a continually recycled resource.  \n  \nIn this circular model, carbon dioxide emitted during industrial processes—which account for approximately 10% of global CO2 emissions—becomes the feedstock for new products, which will eventually release that carbon again at the end of their lifecycle. This carbon can then be recaptured and transformed once more, creating a sustainable loop that minimizes the need to extract additional fossil resources. “We’re using an industrial version of photosynthesis,” says Etosha Cave, cofounder of Twelve. “Plants have been capturing and transforming CO2 for billions of years. We’re just accelerating that process and directing it toward creating specific, useful molecules.”\nEconomic and Security Benefits  \nBeyond its environmental advantages, carbon transformation offers significant economic and security benefits. By developing and scaling these technologies domestically, the United States can position itself as a leader in next-generation industrial processes. This creates local jobs and technological expertise that strengthen our economy.  \n  \nCarbon transformation also addresses supply chain vulnerabilities by reducing reliance on imported petroleum-based products. When companies can produce essential chemicals and fuels using locally captured carbon dioxide and renewable energy, they become less susceptible to global supply disruptions and price fluctuations in the fossil fuel market. “This isn’t just about climate—it’s about American innovation and manufacturing competitiveness,” asserts James Martinez, former assistant secretary of energy. “As companies invest in carbon transformation infrastructure, they’re simultaneously investing in American industrial capacity and reducing reliance on imported energy and materials.”\n**The Road to Widespread Adoption**  \nWhile carbon transformation technology is still scaling up, its potential to address both emissions reduction and sustainable manufacturing makes it a compelling piece of our climate solution puzzle. Several factors will influence its widespread adoption:  \n1. Technological advancement: Continued improvements in efficiency, lower carbon capture costs and scalability and scalability will make carbon transformation more economically viable across a wider range of applications.  \n2. Policy support: Incentives for carbon utilization, such as tax credits for products made with captured carbon, can accelerate market adoption.  \n3. Corporate commitments: As more companies pledge to reduce their carbon footprints, demand for materials and fuels produced through carbon transformation will grow.  \n4. Consumer awareness: Increasing public recognition of “made from air” products will drive market demand for goods produced through carbon transformation.\n**The Future is Carbon-Intelligent**  \nAs carbon transformation technology continues to develop and deploy at larger scales, we move closer to a future where the products we use every day are made from air—a future where carbon emissions become valuable inputs rather than harmful outputs.  \n  \nThis transformation of our relationship with carbon could be key to creating a sustainable, low-carbon economy. By turning our perception of carbon dioxide from problem to resource, we open new avenues for addressing a whole host of challenges, from supply chain resilience to energy independence, while continuing to produce the materials modern society relies on.  \n  \nIn this carbon-intelligent future, the question will no longer be how to eliminate carbon from our industrial processes, but rather, how do we best utilize it to create a more sustainable and resilient world?\nAuthor  \nYoussef Tazi   \nSenior Manager of CO2 Business Development   \nTwelve"

    "content": "Svante Technologies Inc. (Svante), a global leader in carbon capture and removal technologies, has officially completed the commissioning of its new Centre of Excellence for Carbon Capture and Removal – Redwood manufacturing Facility (Redwood) in Burnaby, British Columbia. This milestone marks the launch of the world’s first gigafactory dedicated to producing commercial-scale carbon capture and removal filters designed to trap CO2 directly from industrial emissions and the atmosphere, and with the mindset of high-volume automation and product standardization to lower the manufacturing cost.\nThe Redwood Facility spans 141,000 square feet and is equipped to manufacture enough solid sorbent-based filters to capture up to 10 million tons of CO2 annually, equivalent to the emissions of more than 27 million cars. Svante’s patented structured sorbent filters, coated with metal-organic framework (MOF), represent a next-generation solution for managing industrial carbon emissions.\n“Today, we are making history,” said Claude Letourneau, President & CEO of Svante. “This gigafactory is a critical step forward in building the infrastructure necessary to scale up the carbon management industry and to build a marketplace for physical CO2. This first-of-a-kind manufacturing facility is a demonstration of what’s possible when technology and climate ambition align to lend nature a hand in managing global CO2 emissions.”\nSvante is currently focusing on biogenic carbon dioxide removal (CDR) sectors like pulp and paper, ethanol production, and waste-to-energy, where carbon concentrations in post-combustion flue gas are higher, and capture costs are lower to generate CDR credits. Capturing the emissions from other industries, such as cement, steel, and fossil fuels, is an essential part of a sustainable energy transition, and the commissioning of Redwood shows that Svante is stepping up to the challenge.\nThe facility’s launch follows a US $145 million capital investment and is supported by a roster of strategic investors, including Chevron New Energies, Temasek, M&G, Canada Growth Fund, United Airlines Ventures, Samsung E&A, GE Vernova, and more. Svante anticipates the need for additional gigafactories like Redwood in the next decade to keep pace with global carbon management market demand.\nSvante’s technology is already powering several major carbon capture pilot projects, including installations at Chevron’s Kern River asset in the San Joaquin Valley in California. Additionally, its earlier work with Lafarge Holcim on Project CO2MENT continues to demonstrate effective carbon capture at Lafarge’s Richmond Cement Plant in British Columbia, Canada. In addition to serving the post-combustion or “point source” carbon capture market, Svante also manufactures filters for the leading direct air capture company, Climeworks, as part of their latest Gen 3 DAC technology, which Climeworks says cuts the cost of regenerative energy in half and doubles the CO2 capture volumetric capacity.\nWith its breakthrough approach and global manufacturing ambitions, Svante is setting a new benchmark for engineered carbon capture and removal solutions. This facility is solidifying investor, customer, and partner confidence in Svante’s ability to deliver commercial projects and products today at scale and demonstrating that the company is strategically positioned for long-term success.\n“We’re also proud to launch this transformative manufacturing facility in Canada, which allows us to bring the supply chain to our shores and bring carbon management solutions closer to the needs of emitting industries in North America.”\n  * **Claude Letourneau, President & CEO of Svante**"

Al Nouf will be the largest single-site carbon-capture-ready Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant in the UAE. It will be located within the newly established Al Nouf Complex, a coastal site strategically designated to become a major hub for power and water production in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The state-of-the-art plant is designed to deliver world-class efficiency, operational flexibility, and lower emissions, supporting the UAE’s long-term decarbonisation agenda.\nThe Al Nouf Complex will play a pivotal role in the UAE’s energy and water security, with the site carefully selected for its strategic coastal location and ability to accommodate both seawater-cooled power generation and reverse osmosis (RO) desalination technologies. Designed with long-term scalability in mind, the complex features ample space and infrastructure capacity to support multiple utility-scale energy and desalination projects in the future. This integrated planning approach underscores EWEC’s commitment to developing energy clusters that deliver synergies in performance, efficiency, and environmental sustainability.\nEWEC is strategically accelerating the UAE’s energy transition to a decarbonised system, with the advanced and efficient Al Nouf providing transitional capacity to support the integration of large-scale renewable energy and provide additional flexibility during periods of peak power demand. Flexible and high-efficiency gas-fired plants, such as Al Nouf, will be crucial for ensuring the security of supply while the country’s energy sector transforms into a renewable and clean-focused industry. As part of the IPP programme, the project is expected to support Emiratisation targets by facilitating the inclusion of UAE Nationals across key roles, thereby supporting national workforce development goals.\nAhmed Ali Alshamsi, Chief Executive Officer of EWEC, said: “The development of Al Nouf power plant is a key component of EWEC’s long-term strategy to deliver a flexible, efficient, and decarbonised energy system. As we accelerate the integration of renewable and clean energy into the grid, advanced natural gas-fired capacity will play an essential role in ensuring system reliability and balancing intermittency. Al Nouf’s strategic location and high-efficiency design will enhance our ability to meet future demand while supporting the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative. We look forward to engaging with qualified developers and advancing this important project.”\nAl Nouf will closely follow the model of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi’s successful IPP programme, where developers enter into a long-term agreement with EWEC as the sole procurer. It will involve the development, financing, construction, operation, maintenance, and ownership of the plant, with the successful developer or developer consortium owning up to 40 per cent of the entity. The remaining equity will be held indirectly by the Abu Dhabi Government.\nExpected to begin commercial operations in Q3 2029, Al Nouf’s efficient natural gas turbine technology will generate up to 3.3 gigawatts of electricity. The RFP shared with bidders outlines comprehensive requirements and technical parameters, encouraging the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) where relevant to improve plant performance, operational efficiency, and predictive maintenance. The project is also expected to leverage state-of-the-art technologies including digital twinning and advanced monitoring systems, to optimise lifecycle performance and system resilience. Responses to the RFP are expected in Q4 2025.\nTo ensure efficient and timely project development following the award, EWEC has proactively reserved gas turbines for Al Nouf. This early-stage action will enable the rapid mobilisation of resources and reinforce EWEC’s ability to meet future power demand while maintaining system reliability and supporting the UAE Energy Strategy 2050."

    "author": "RepAir",
    "content": "RepAir Carbon US Inc., developer of a uniquely energy-efficient Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology, and C-Questra, an independent European carbon storage startup, announced a strategic partnership to develop the European Union's first onshore Direct Air Capture and Storage (DACS) project in France. \nThis project is promising for a number of reasons: it is the first onshore Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) project of its kind in the EU which eliminates the need for expensive midstream and offshore infrastructure. It also uses a heat-free, ultra-modular electrochemical technology - provided by RepAir - which reduces energy consumption by 70% compared to conventional DAC solutions by relying solely on electricity. \nConventional DAC solutions face criticism for their high energy consumption, resulting in prohibitive cost at scale. Additionally, these systems rely on solvents and sorbents that require regular replacement and introduce potential health and safety risks. In contrast, RepAir's approach is a groundbreaking innovation that requires only electricity. This technology provides an efficient, cost-effective, safe, and scalable solution for atmospheric CO2 removal.\nThis new partnership creates the first DACS value chain on French soil that enables co-location of capture and storage facilities reducing midstream infrastructure needs. The project is in Grandpuits, near Paris, where C-Questra has applied for a permit to develop an onshore CO2 storage site. By 2030, the goal is to remove 100,000 tons of CO2 per year from the atmosphere, scaling up megatons by 2035. This large-scale carbon removal is considered essential by experts to significantly reduce atmospheric CO2 levels.\nThe collaboration also includes a commitment to explore local manufacturing opportunities in the Île-de-France region, thus creating new green jobs, and developing similar DACS projects in other EU countries. \n\"This is setting a new standard for efficient, scalable carbon removal in Europe,\" said Jean-Philippe Hiegel, Head of Strategy and Growth at RepAir Carbon. \"The combination of our technology, which uses just 0.6 MWh per ton of CO2 captured - compared to 2.5 MWh for most competitors, and C-Questra’s unique set of carbon storage expertise, addresses a key barrier to widespread DACS adoption. This is incredibly exciting given global decarbonisation needs.”\n\"As one of the few CO2 storage companies operating independently from the fossil fuel industry, C-Questra offers the paramount safety, permanence and sustainability needed to rapidly advance CCS projects in Europe,\" said Walid Sinno, Founder and CEO of C-Questra. \"Our partnership with RepAir allows us to demonstrate Europe’s ability to mature onshore direct air capture and storage projects. This is important to balance the momentum created by the US Inflation Act and resurface Europe as a leader in the CDR space.”\nThe project aligns with France’s recently published CCS strategy, which outlines ambitious goals for the amount of CO2 that needs to be captured and stored in France by 2030. It is well-positioned to capitalise on European funding opportunities, including the Innovation Fund, where no Direct Air Capture project has yet been funded.\nRepAir Carbon has quickly established itself as a pioneer in the DAC space. This partnership follows another landmark DAC project in Greece which is also aiming to reach megaton levels. RepAir is also focused on capturing CO2 from diluted point sources, such as aluminum smelting processes. This versatility positions the company to address both critically needed carbon dioxide reduction and removal efforts.\nAbout RepAir Carbon\nRepAir is leading the transition to a carbon-negative future with a highly efficient, economically viable and ultra-modular solution for large-scale carbon dioxide removal. The company’s electrochemical cell technology uses 70% less energy than conventional methods, operates without liquids or solvents, and produces no hazardous materials or waste. \nAbout C-Questra\nC-Questra is a leading independent European startup and CCUS operator specialising in the CO2 storage value chain empowering sustainable industrial efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."

    "author": "Deep Sky",
    "content": "Deep Sky, the Montreal-based carbon removal project developer, has accomplished North America’s first underground CO2 storage via Direct Air Capture (DAC) with CO2 captured by Skyrenu, a Quebec-based DAC company. The breakthrough was achieved at Deep Sky Alpha, Canada’s first carbon removal commercialization centre, located in Innisfail, Alberta.\nIn a major milestone for the Canadian carbon removal ecosystem, Skyrenu’s DAC unit pulled CO₂ directly from the atmosphere and, in partnership with Deep Sky, permanently stored it underground. This marks the first time on the continent that CO₂ captured by a Canadian-developed DAC technology has gone through the full carbon removal cycle.\n“We’re incredibly proud to lead the way as the first Quebec-based DAC technology to capture CO₂ for permanent storage in North America,” said Gabriel Vézina, Skyrenu CEO. “Our partnership with Deep Sky is a powerful example of how to accelerate DAC to climate-relevant scale. Deep Sky’s ability to integrate the full value chain—from CO₂ capture to sequestration—perfectly complements Skyrenu’s focus on designing and producing high-performance DAC units. Together, we can deliver impactful projects faster, generate high-quality carbon removal, and set a new benchmark for the industry. This first win proves that we have the model to lead the way in Canada and beyond.”\nSkyrenu’s DAC unit was deployed at Deep Sky Alpha, the world’s first cross-technology carbon removal centre powered by solar energy. With the capacity to remove 50 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, Skyrenu’s DAC unit is among a select group of technologies chosen to capture CO2 at Deep Sky Alpha. Deep Sky selected Skyrenu’s technology for its potential to deliver low-cost CO₂ capture. Designed to accelerate the path from prototype to commercialization, Alpha enables leading carbon removal developers to validate, scale, and generate high-quality carbon removal credits in a real-world environment.\n“This is exactly what Deep Sky Alpha was built for,” said Alex Petre, Deep Sky CEO. “A product of Sherbrooke University, Skyrenu’s achievement shows that Canadian climate tech can lead on a global stage and that carbon removal is ready to scale today.”\nAs governments and corporations look to meet net-zero goals, Skyrenu’s successful deployment underscores the importance of homegrown climate solutions that are permanent, measurable, and ready to scale. High-quality CDR is essential for achieving net zero emissions goals and mitigating the impacts of climate change."

    "date": "May 14, 2025",
    "author": "Iowa Renewable Fuels Association",
    "content": "On May 12, the Iowa Senate voted 27-22 to pass House File 639, effectively banning carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) projects in the state. The vote goes against farmers and ethanol producers seeking to unlock huge new markets around the world that are demanding ultra-low carbon ethanol.\n“IRFA is deeply disappointed by today’s vote,” said Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw. “After enduring the largest two-year income drop in history, farmers are desperate to find new markets. CCS is the key to unlocking massive new demand for ethanol and corn around the world. For three years, IRFA has sought to work on a middle ground approach that enhanced landowner rights and protections but would allow CCS projects a path forward. While a majority of the Iowa Senate turned their back on Iowa agriculture tonight, IRFA thanks those who stood for common sense.”\nHouse File 639 essentially bans all CCS projects, even those that might achieve 100% voluntary easement, by putting permit restrictions in place making them not economically viable. Despite rhetoric from supporters of the bill, it fails to enhance property owner rights and targets only CCS projects. All other future privately owned projects, including crude oil, wind and solar, would not be impacted by the bill. The legislation does nothing to enhance support for land restoration, soil compaction remediation, tile replacement, or lost yields.\n“For 25 years, Iowa has benefited greatly from being the most profitable place in the world to convert corn kernels into ethanol,” added Shaw. “Once the Tallgrass CCS pipeline in Nebraska begins operations later this year, that will no longer be the case. If this legislation goes into effect, there will be very real, very severe economic consequences as others, like Nebraska, North Dakota, and Brazil, move forward with CCS. Iowa is poised to be left behind. Expansion plans will be shelved, and we could see additional plant closures over time as the CCS-enabled plants elsewhere expand. IRFA members will be asking Gov. Reynolds to stand up for their future and the future of rural Iowa by vetoing this misguided legislation.”\nAccording to the Farm Journal March Ag Economists’ Monthly Monitor, 62% of the 70 ag economists from across the nation confirm the economic decline is expected to continue into 2025. CCS is the most cost-effective and impactful tool to unlock new markets that demand ultra-low carbon ethanol, such as heavy-duty engines, ocean-going vessels, rail and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Estimates for SAF alone are pegged at 100 billion gallons annually worldwide, potentially increasing corn grind by billions of bushels."

    "content": "Nuada’s next-generation carbon capture solution is now operational at enfinium’s Ferrybridge-1 energy from waste (EfW) facility in West Yorkshire. The successful commissioning of the pilot plant marks the start of a collaboration between Nuada, a UK innovator in carbon capture technology, and enfinium, a leading UK EfW operator. The demonstration will run for a minimum of six months.\n  \nThe trial will showcase the performance of Nuada’s carbon capture technology in an industrial EfW setting for the first time. For enfinium, it represents a key step towards its ambition to deploy carbon capture at scale across its portfolio of six UK facilities, affirming its position as a leader in decarbonising the waste sector.\nThe new pilot plant uses metal-organic framework (MOF) technology that captures carbon dioxide from point sources through a vacuum swing process. This innovation has the potential to deliver significant efficiencies when deployed at a commercial scale.\nAround 50% of the unrecyclable waste produced by society is made up of biogenic content including organic material such as waste food, plants and paper, which has already naturally absorbed CO2 from the atmosphere. Installing CCS technology at an energy from waste facility enables this CO2 to be permanently captured and stored rather than released back into the atmosphere, resulting in a net carbon removal from the atmosphere.\nRecent analyses by the Climate Change Committee and The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies found that the energy from waste sector could contribute between 5 and 8 million tonnes of carbon removals every year by 2050\nSimon Forshaw, VP Engineering & Construction at enfinium, said “Deploying CCS at energy from waste plants is critical to decarbonise the UK’s unrecyclable waste and generate carbon removals at scale to achieve net zero.\nNuada’s next-generation carbon capture technology has the potential to deliver sizeable energy and cost savings in the carbon capture process. The piloting of this exciting technology at our Ferrybridge facility enables us to better understand how we can deploy carbon capture at scale across our entire fleet.”\nDr Conor Hamill, co-CEO of Nuada, said: “Partnering with enfinium on this trial allows us to demonstrate the performance our innovative carbon capture technology. We believe that CCUS innovation like ours can help the EfW sector to efficiently unlock value from an existing waste stream CO2. We look forward to deepening our partnership and supporting enfinium’s CCUS goals.”"

    "author": "University of Wyoming",
    "content": "The Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub (SCS Hub), a collaborative project between the University of Wyoming’s School of Energy Resources (SER) and Frontier Infrastructure Holdings, a portfolio company of Tailwater Capital and a leading developer of low-carbon infrastructure across the Mountain West and Texas, successfully completed the drilling operations for a second deep-characterization well -- a key step in advancing commercial-scale carbon sequestration in Wyoming.\nReaching a total vertical depth of 18,437 feet, the J1-15 well is now the deepest Class VI carbon storage well ever drilled in the United States. Preliminary data from the well is highly encouraging, showing geologic similarities to a proven acid gas injection site located just over 25 miles north. These results further validate the potential of the SCS Hub as a large-scale, permanent carbon storage facility.\n“Successfully drilling and testing a second well on this project has confirmed our preliminary interpretation of the reservoir and is a major step forward to validate the region’s storage potential,” says Robby Rockey, president and co-chief executive officer of Frontier. “This deeper well gives us a more complete picture of the subsurface, reinforcing our commitment to building scalable, practical carbon solutions for Wyoming’s key industries.”\nThe SCS Hub is part of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Carbon Storage Assurance Enterprise (CarbonSAFE) Initiative and is co-led by SER and Frontier. The project aims to establish a commercial-scale carbon capture, utilization and storage hub in Sweetwater County, capable of delivering long-term, secure CO₂ storage for industrial emitters across the region.\nAfter successfully drilling the project’s first well (SCS-1), the team then extended J1-15 to reach the Madison Limestone, another high-priority formation. This dual-target strategy is central to understanding the full storage capacity of the hub.\nGeological evaluation is being led by SER’s Center for Economic Geology Research (CEGR). The team has collected core samples, well logs and water from the site, which will undergo detailed analysis to assess reservoir characteristics and seal integrity.\n“Securing Class VI permits and executing a drilling program to this depth required meticulous planning and coordination with multiple regulatory bodies,” says Alicia Summers, Frontier’s chief development officer. “The geological data we’re seeing reinforces why we selected this location and validates our technical approach to developing world-class carbon storage infrastructure.”\nThe technical results support this strategic approach.\n“The decision to deepen the well to the Madison Limestone has proven successful,” says Zunsheng “John” Jiao, program manager at CEGR and co-principal investigator of the project. “The logging data confirms a continuous zone of strong porosity and flow -- indicators of excellent storage potential.”\nCurrently, the team is assessing the data collected from the wells in the storage hub. The project team is especially optimistic about the Madison Limestone, a formation also used in North America’s largest carbon capture and storage operation located 25 miles north of the SCS Hub. The analogy highlights the Madison’s potential as a safe and effective storage reservoir.\n“We’ve seen what the Madison can deliver through Shute Creek,” Rockey says. “Now we’re applying those learnings here, with results that are very promising.”\nThe SCS Hub continues to progress toward key regulatory and engineering milestones. The next phase will focus on detailed modeling, permitting and preparation for eventual injection operations.\n“I’m proud of our team and partners for reaching this critical point,” CEGR Director Fred McLaughlin says. “The data collected from this well is essential to confirming the feasibility of the SCS Hub and advancing Wyoming’s position in the emerging carbon economy.”"

    "content": "Since establishing an exclusive partnership in 2021, the Norne Carbon Storage Hub (\"Norne\"), a Fidelis New Energy, LLC portfolio company, and the Port of Aalborg have executed definitive agreements for the Norne CO2 reception facility with the initial site designed to handle 15 million tonnes of CO2 per year. As co-applicants, Norne and the Port of Aalborg, were awarded a Connecting Europe Facility (\"CEF\") Energy grant by the European Union. CEF is an EU programme focused on accelerating the development of strategic cross-border energy infrastructure. The grant will co-fund the development and construction of a new quay to support the Norne CO2 reception facilities serving multiple Danish onshore and near-shore CO2 storage facilities as well as the beneficial use of CO2 in industrial applications and decarbonised fuels.\nNorne has completed the front-end engineering and design (\"FEED\") studies for both the CO2 reception facility and a connecting pipeline to nearby CO2 storage. In addition, extensive environmental and ecological assessments have been completed. Norne's designation as a Project of Common Interest (\"PCI\"), by the EU in 2023, further streamlines the permitting process, enabling a faster Environmental Impact Assessment for the pipeline than otherwise would be possible without the already completed work and the PCI status. Building on the exclusive lease agreement and the CEF grant award, Norne and the Port of Aalborg will commence construction of a new 500-metre quay in the Port of Aalborg, corresponding to an area of 60,000 square metres of quay space. The new quay space will host the CO2 reception and connecting infrastructure, advancing Denmark's carbon capture and storage ecosystem.\nNorne will provide European emitters access to an excellent deepwater port and cost-effective and safe onshore and nearshore CO2 storage. Norne's PCI status ensures prioritised permitting, as the project is recognized as an urgent project of the highest national significance and it is considered a project of overriding public interest by the EU when carrying out the relevant environmental assessments. The PCI status also opens the door for additional CEF Energy grants, which Norne is actively pursuing to support further development across the CO2 value chain.\nKristian Thulesen Dahl, CEO of the Port of Aalborg, stated: \"We are very excited to continue the work we have done with Fidelis and Norne since 2021 to make the Port of Aalborg a key CO2 hub enabling economical and safe storage of CO2 onshore and near shore. In addition, we are excited to be able to provide decarbonisation services to attract new industries to the Port of Aalborg. We therefore see the collaboration with Norne as an important business development differentiator as we continue to expand the Port's role in helping to decarbonise Denmark and the EU.\"\nLars Bo Christiansen, President of Norne, concluded: \"Since 2021, we have worked closely with the Port of Aalborg, the European Union, the Danish Government, and other key stakeholders. We look forward to building on this long-term partnership – not only to expand beyond the current capacity of 15 million tonnes per year at Norne's site, but also to attract new industrial projects to the Port that require decarbonization solutions.\"\nAbout Fidelis:\nFidelis is an energy infrastructure company driving decarbonisation through infrastructure development and investments in biofuels, low- or negative-carbon intensity products, and carbon capture and storage.

    "content": "[**XPRIZE**](http://www.xprize.org/), the world’s leader in designing and operating large-scale incentive competitions to solve humanity’s grand challenges, announced the winners of its $100 million [**XPRIZE Carbon Removal**](https://www.xprize.org/prizes/carbonremoval) competition, the largest global incentive competition award in history. The four-year competition was designed to combat climate change by challenging teams around the world to develop high-quality carbon dioxide removal (CDR) solutions that are scalable to gigatonne level and durably and sustainably remove carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere and oceans. The winning teams, selected from 20 impressive Finalists across 11 countries, each successfully removed more than 1,000 net tonnes of CO₂ in the final year of the competition, meeting XPRIZE’s bold demonstration requirements, the first step towards scaling sustainably to remove billions of tonnes globally.\n[**Mati Carbon**](https://www.mati.earth/) received the $50M grand prize for their enhanced rock weathering solution. Runners up NetZero, Vaulted Deep and UNDO Carbon were awarded $15M, $8M and $5M, respectively. Two XFACTOR awards of $1M each were awarded to Planetary and Project Hajar, a partnership between Aircapture and 44.01. This announcement, timed during Earth Week, coincides with recognition of the winning teams as part of the TIME100 Summit in New York, where XPRIZE is a supporting partner.\nExcess CO₂ in the Earth’s atmosphere and oceans is the main driver of climate change, with human-produced CO₂ emissions accounting for more than two-thirds of all greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to dramatic emissions reductions, scientists agree that sustainable and scalable carbon removal solutions are necessary to keep average global temperatures from rising 2°C above pre-industrial levels, a critical threshold above which dangerous and cascading effects of human-generated climate change will occur. As we approach this “tipping point,” rising temperatures are contributing to higher sea levels, longer and hotter droughts, and more frequent extreme weather events. \n“At this critical turning point for our planet, the technologies developed by these winning teams represent hope with a broad range of approaches that are suitable for different geographies and can help the world reach net zero and ultimately reverse climate change,” said Anousheh Ansari, chief executive officer, XPRIZE. “We cannot stabilize our climate without sustainably and safely extracting carbon from our atmosphere and oceans at large scales. I’m incredibly proud of the ways this XPRIZE competition catalyzed and fostered the innovation and collaboration necessary to build this critical new industry that was missing prior to our competition.”\nThe grand prize winner **Mati Carbon** demonstrated a highly durable approach to CDR, by applying finely crushed basalt over agricultural lands in India to accelerate a natural weathering process that permanently draws down atmospheric CO₂. Beyond carbon removal, Mati Carbon’s process delivers significant benefits to smallholder farmers. These farmers are among the least responsible for and the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Mati Carbon’s deployments bolster farmers’ livelihoods through improved soil health, reduced agricultural inputs, and increased income at zero cost to them. Mati Carbon’s team has developed a scientifically rigorous approach to monitoring and verification, and excelled across each of XPRIZE’s evaluation criteria – operational, sustainability, and cost metrics – giving the XPRIZE judges the highest confidence in Mati Carbon’s solution’s long-term scalability.\n“Being named the grand prize winner of XPRIZE Carbon Removal is not just a validation of our approach to CDR, it also represents a major catalyst to building out the science and infrastructure needed to deliver on our mission – generating climate resilience and economic empowerment for the more than 100 million smallholder farmers in developing economies worldwide,” said Shantanu Agarwal, Founder and CEO of Mati Carbon. “I am very proud of our Mati Carbon team and the thousands of smallholder farmers who have partnered with us in India, Tanzania, and Zambia.”\nXPRIZE named additional runner-up teams for their compelling carbon removal demonstrations in the final year of the competition. [**NetZero**](https://netzero.green/en/), a French biochar company operating in Brazil, earned recognition as first runner-up and $15M for a highly efficient circular model to source and process tropical crop residues, then returning the biochar to local farmers to improve crop yields and resilience. [**Vaulted Deep**](https://vaulteddeep.com/), a U.S.-based waste management company, earned recognition as second runner-up and $8M for permanently storing otherwise unusable organic waste deep underground. [**UNDO Carbon**](https://un-do.com/), an enhanced rock weathering solution operating in Scotland and Canada, earned recognition as third runner-up and $5M for accelerating the natural process of rock weathering to permanently remove atmospheric CO₂ and boost soil health. $1M XFACTOR awards were also given to [**Planetary**](https://www.planetarytech.com/)**Project Hajar** for coming closest to meeting XPRIZE’s stringent demonstration criteria in the Ocean and Air tracks.[**Aircapture**](https://www.aircapture.com/) and [**44.01**](https://www.4401.earth/), removes atmospheric CO₂ using direct air capture and mineralizes it in peridotite rock formations deep underground in the United Arab Emirates’ Hajar mountains.\nIn May 2024, [**20 Finalist teams**](https://www.xprize.org/prizes/carbonremoval/finalists) were selected to advance to the final round of the competition and challenged to demonstrate their CDR solutions at kilotonne scale over a one-year testing period, model their expected cost at megatonne scale, and show a viable pathway to scaling sustainably to gigatonne scale. The Judges assessed that all 20 Finalists performed exceptionally well in the competition and represent compelling examples of high-quality, scalable carbon dioxide removal solutions with the potential to make a meaningful difference in the fight against climate change. They also represent a diverse portfolio of carbon dioxide removal solutions that will all be necessary to scale in different geographies around the world. \n“We’re incredibly proud of all the teams whose work contributed to significantly advancing the carbon removal industry,” said Nikki Batchelor, executive director, XPRIZE Carbon Removal. “Over the course of the four-year competition, more than 8,400 dedicated individuals - from scientists and engineers to students and technologists - came together to drive this critical industry forward. Their work is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, ensuring the solutions needed to confront climate change are available now.”\nLaunched in 2021, XPRIZE Carbon Removal catalyzed the development of a generation of new carbon removal solutions that laid the groundwork for [**an emerging $3.9B carbon credit market**](https://www.cdr.fyi/) for high-quality durable carbon removal in the last four years. XPRIZE Carbon Removal galvanized over 1,300 teams from over 88 countries to develop new methodologies for CDR across four removal pathways - air, rocks, ocean, and land. Half of these teams formed specifically to compete in the competition. Over the course of the competition, $5M was awarded to student teams, and $15M in Milestone Awards were granted to teams with early demonstrations of their CDR solutions. \n“This is a monumental milestone for the climate movement at large,” said David Babson, executive vice president, Climate and Energy, XPRIZE. “The vast potential of the carbon removal solutions coming out of this competition highlight the profound impact incentive competitions have in accelerating innovation. We’re proud to serve as a powerful catalyst for transformative solutions to tackle the most pressing global climate challenges.” \nXPRIZE Carbon Removal builds on a decade of work in the carbon management sector, which includes the NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE that offered $20M to innovators to develop technologies that captured and converted industrial CO₂ emissions into usable products. Awarded in 2021, the competition resulted in winning technologies that mineralize carbon into concrete to reduce the carbon footprint of the built environment. XPRIZE has been analyzing the growth of the circular carbon industry, and according to the latest annual [**Circular Carbon Market Report**](https://www.xprize.org/prizes/carbonremoval/articles/2024-circular-carbon-market-report) almost $28B has been invested in the industry, with $6.6B in 2024 alone.\nXPRIZE Carbon Removal is funded by the Musk Foundation.\nLearn more and get involved at [**xprize.org/carbonremoval**](https://www.xprize.org/prizes/carbonremoval)."

    "content": "Climeworks, a global leader in carbon removal, and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), one of the largest shipping companies in the world, signed an agreement to remove 13,400 tons of CO₂ from the air by 2030. MOL is Climeworks’ first partner from the shipping industry, underscoring the Japanese company’s leadership in advancing technologies that durably remove CO₂ from the air.\nIn addition to the carbon removal offtake agreement, the two companies signed a Memorandum of Understanding for potential investment in Climeworks’ future Direct Air Capture plants.

    "content": "Carbon Direct, in collaboration with Microsoft, released a first-of-its-kind [guide to high-quality environmental attribute certificates (EACs)](https://www.carbon-direct.com/research-and-reports/criteria-for-high-quality-environmental-attribute-certificates) in the concrete and steel sectors. These new quality criteria are designed to help Microsoft address greenhouse gas emissions from scope 3 activity with EACs that are verifiable, additional, and catalytic. The criteria are also relevant to other organizations who seek to mitigate supply chain emissions from the embodied carbon of commodity materials used in both equipment and building construction.\nThe criteria build on insight from collaborations with industry experts, suppliers, and sustainability organizations and are grounded in Microsoft’s commitment to become carbon negative by 2030. The guide explains the rationale behind EAC pathway decisions, encourages partnerships and collaborations in the supply chain, and guides procurement decisions. The criteria are designed to set a high bar for the integrity of EACs in today’s rapidly evolving market.\nSince 2021, Carbon Direct and Microsoft have collaborated to advance science-based guidance for carbon dioxide removal. These new criteria reflect their joint success in stimulating the market for that decarbonization pathway, while aligning with the expertise and activities of companies and organizations who are working to build concrete and steel EAC markets.\n**Addressing the Embodied Carbon Challenge in Data Centers**\nConcrete and steel account for approximately 13% of global CO2 emissions, making their decarbonization a critical climate priority. Microsoft is addressing these impacts by reducing demand for these materials through innovative design and procuring low-carbon alternatives, while also working to decarbonize its supply chains, efforts that can drive broader industry change. \nThe market for low-carbon concrete and steel is immature, with challenges to direct procurement including limited financing for first-of-a-kind technologies with uncontracted output, limited supply, geographic mismatch, supply chain constraints, and limited willingness-to-pay a green premium.\nTo drive both company-level and broader sectoral decarbonization, Microsoft is engaging directly with suppliers to procure low-carbon alternatives to conventional concrete and steel, as well as investing in and helping pilot new low-carbon production pathways. \n“EACs have the potential to address a number of the most critical challenges to scaling deep decarbonization solutions, not least by providing financial certainty. By setting a high bar for EACs, we’re ensuring that our investments drive real, additional, and scalable emissions reductions as we invite the industry to join us in shaping a credible, high-impact market for low-carbon building materials,” said Julia Fidler, Fuel and Materials Decarbonization Lead, Microsoft. \n“To decarbonize the world’s largest supply chains, we need solutions that are both ambitious and credible. These first-of-their-kind criteria set a quality bar for environmental attribute certificates so that every EAC transaction can drive real, additional, and verifiable emissions reductions in concrete and steel,” said Dr. Meera Atreya, Director of Decarbonization Science & European Advisory, Carbon Direct. “By prioritizing high integrity, social and environmental safeguards, and a pathway to scale, we’re not just supporting Microsoft and other companies to meet their climate goals, we’re helping to catalyze a market transformation that benefits the entire sector and the planet.”\n**Defining High-Quality EACs to Shape a Nascent Market**\nTo maximize the potential climate impact of its EAC procurement, Microsoft worked with Carbon Direct to establish the following rigorous, science-based criteria: \nRequire that EACs only be used when material with significant sustainability benefits cannot be directly procured in sufficient quantity within a project’s physical supply chain.\nAchieve a [Low Carbon Concrete (or Cement) Rating](https://gccassociation.org/lcr/) of at least “D” by the Global Cement and Concrete Association or a Progress Level 2 rating or higher by [ResponsibleSteel](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6538e481169ed7220c330f0a/66f2c08a4d88709f1a67863e_ResponsibleSteel%27s%20Approach%20to%20Decarbonisation.pdf).\nDemand robust additionality, particularly that projects must go beyond efficiency savings and subsidized upgrades, regulatory requirements, and common practice.\nSet high standards for social and environmental integrity, including community engagement and living wage requirements.\nMandate independent verification, traceability, and safeguards against double counting of environmental benefits.\nRequire assessment and mitigation of leakage risks to help prevent claimed reductions from shifting emissions elsewhere.\nThe criteria provide detailed recommendations for EAC implementation in both concrete and steel. All EAC guardrails support the delivery of real, additional, and verifiable climate impact, setting a new standard for the emerging market. These criteria will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect advances in technology, data, and market conditions.\n**Read the report:**[Criteria for High-Quality Environmental Attribute Certificates in the Concrete and Steel Sectors](https://www.carbon-direct.com/research-and-reports/criteria-for-high-quality-environmental-attribute-certificates)\n**To dive deeper, read Carbon Direct’s blog:** [Decarbonizing concrete & steel with environmental attribute certificates.](https://www.carbon-direct.com/insights/decarbonizing-concrete-and-steel-with-environmental-attribute-certificates)\n**About Carbon Direct**\nCarbon Direct is the leader in science-based carbon management.

    "date": "August 7, 2025",
    "author": "Dalum Beverage Equipment",
    "content": "The fight against climate change demands innovative solutions, and sometimes, the most impactful advancements emerge from unexpected places. [DALUM](http://bit.ly/3H5h5Y1) Beverage Equipment, a Danish startup initially focused on CO2 recovery within the craft brewing industry and is now proving to be a critical enabler for broader carbon capture and direct air capture (DAC) initiatives, thanks to its pioneering and cost-effective CO2 liquefaction technology.  \n  \nFounded by veteran engineer Kim Dalum, a recognized expert in CO2 processing, DALUM Beverage Equipment developed a patented solution allowing craft breweries and distilleries to recover, purify, and liquefy CO2 produced during fermentation for reuse or sale. This process is a significant \"low-hanging fruit\" for carbon avoidance, given that fermentation CO2 boasts over 97% purity, a stark contrast to the mere ~12% purity typically found in industrial flue gases.\nIt’s been a rewarding experience working with some of the brightest pioneers and innovators in the carbon capture industry to help them solve this ongoing challenge of processing and liquefying CO2.” — Kim Dalum.  \n  \nThe potential impact within the beverage sector alone is substantial. With 22 million barrels of craft beer produced globally each year, there's a potential to recover 80,000 metric tons of CO2 annually, at an estimated cost of just €70 per ton. A prime example of this success is [Stewart Brewing](https://bit.ly/3UGY55c) in Scotland, which not only reuses its recovered CO2 but also sells the excess, turning a waste product into a valuable revenue stream.  \n  \nBeyond breweries, distilleries represent another largely untapped source of biogenic CO2. While distilleries don't typically use CO2 in their processes, captured CO2 could be sold, sequestered in building materials, or even used for dry ice – all applications that directly displace CO2 sourced from industrial, fossil fuel-intensive processes.  \n  \nHowever, DALUM's journey has taken an unexpected turn, revealing a critical need in the wider carbon capture landscape. Over the past two years, numerous carbon capture and DAC startups have approached DALUM, seeking solutions for the final, crucial stage of their process: CO2 liquefaction. Many of these nascent companies, while excelling in front-end capture and enrichment technologies, struggle with finding cost-effective, turn-key solutions for liquefying CO2, especially pilot programs and smaller-scale commercial plants. Kim Dalum elaborates, “It’s been a rewarding experience working with some of the brightest pioneers and innovators in the carbon capture industry to help them solve this ongoing challenge of processing and liquefying CO2 – no single project is the same and very much experimental in nature.”  \n  \nThis is where DALUM's specialized expertise shines. Kim Dalum's background as the former CEO of Union Engineering (now owned by Pentair), a leading manufacturer of industrial CO2 recovery plants, provides an unparalleled foundation in gas processing. DALUM has leveraged this experience to design custom liquefaction solutions capable of purifying CO2 with purity as low as 70% coming from flue gas at a project with the environmental technology company ESTECH in Denmark at the municipality of Odense. Another project Kim Dalum personally was involved in, is in Germany, an innovative DAC project led by [DACMA](https://bit.ly/4lXkdUN) and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).  \n  \nCrucially, DALUM's plants are designed for accessibility. Starting at €44,000, for their smallest size, a 5kg/hr unit, they arrive fully assembled and are remarkably compact – about the size of a phone booth. This makes them an attractive proposition for startups that need efficient, scalable, and readily deployable liquefaction capabilities without significant upfront infrastructure investment.  \n  \nTo date, DALUM has sold ten plants to carbon capture and DAC customers ranging in capacities from 5kg per hour of CO2 to 30kg+ per hour, demonstrating the versatility of their technology, with some units customized for lower purity CO2 streams and others being standard models. By providing this essential \"last mile\" solution, DALUM enables carbon capture and DAC startups to focus on their core capture technologies, accelerating the deployment of crucial climate solutions.  \n  \nDALUM Beverage Equipment's evolution from a niche beverage industry supplier to a pivotal player in the broader carbon capture ecosystem highlights the interconnectedness of sustainable practices across industries. Their innovative approach to CO2 liquefaction is not just optimizing brewing; it's helping to unlock the potential of a truly circular carbon economy."

Crown Prince Haakon of Norway officially unveiled a concrete-made plaque commemorating the historic milestone in attendance of Terje Aasland, Norway’s Minister of Energy, Dr Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board of Heidelberg Materials, and more than 320 guests, including industry leaders, international high-level government officials, as well as representatives from NGOs and start-ups.\nBrevik CCS will capture around 400,000 tons of CO₂ per year, representing 50% of the plant’s emissions – and equivalent to the amount of CO₂ emissions per passenger for roughly 150,000 round-trip flights between Frankfurt and New York. The facility is part of the Norwegian government’s Longship project, developing Europe’s first full-scale value chain for carbon capture, transport, and storage from hard-to-abate industries. Within Longship, the Northern Lights initiative – a collaboration between Equinor, Shell, and TotalEnergies – is the partner responsible for the carbon transport and storage. The CO₂ captured in Brevik will be liquefied and shipped to an onshore terminal on the Norwegian west coast. From there, it will be transported by pipeline to permanent storage under the North Sea. \n“Today marks a historic milestone and tectonic shift in the built environment. The opening of Brevik CCS is a tremendous technological achievement that will serve as a blueprint for entire industries as we progress towards Net Zero and into a new era of sustainable construction,” said Dr Dominik von Achten, Chairman of the Managing Board of Heidelberg Materials during the ceremony. “Above all, it is a testament to what can be accomplished when exceptional minds with a shared vision and strong determination come together. I am very proud of our teams and the partners who have contributed to the success of this project. We owe it to each one of them that supplying net-zero concrete is no longer a future ambition but a reality.”\n“As a key part of Norway’s Longship programme, Brevik CCS is a powerful example of how businesses and government can work hand in hand to pave the way for a more sustainable future,” said Norwegian Minister of Energy Terje Aasland. “This form of collaboration can foster innovation and kick-start development of nascent markets for climate technology.”\nAs part of the ongoing ramp-up of Brevik CCS, first volumes of CO₂ have already been successfully captured, liquefied, and temporarily stored. Northern Lights have started first shipments to their intermediate storage site in Øygarden in June. Subsequently, Heidelberg Materials will begin to deliver evoZero®, the world’s first carbon captured cement enabling net-zero concrete, to customers in Europe. \n“Brevik CCS is a true pioneering project. Thousands of people from all over the world have already visited the facility to learn from our experience. This is not just a technical masterpiece, but a concrete example of industrial leadership on climate issues,” said Giv Brantenberg, General Manager of Heidelberg Materials Northern Europe.\nAs part of the project, the carbon capture facility has been integrated into the Brevik cement plant without disrupting ongoing cement production. Heidelberg Materials recruited 30 employees, who have undergone intensive training and are now responsible for operating the carbon capture facility.\nBrevik CCS is the first in a growing portfolio of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects across Heidelberg Materials. The project will contribute to further scaling carbon capture solutions in the industry as the company is leveraging the lessons learned in Norway."

    "author": "Mitsubishi Corp.",
    "content": "Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (TOKYO: 6503) announced that it will launch a demonstration of technology to capture CO2 from flue gas, using a CO2 capture machine developed by the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in Taiwan and installed at Mitsubishi Electric’s Advanced Technology R&D Center in Amagasaki, Hyogo Prefecture on June 9. The demonstration will last until September 2027.\nIn April 2024, Mitsubishi Electric and ITRI concluded a basic agreement to cooperate on research targeting sustainability technologies. Since then, they have been engaged in research and development aimed at mitigating climate change through carbon dioxide capture and utilization (CCU) technology. CCU separates and captures CO2 emitted from power plants and factories and then uses the recovered CO2 to produce fuel and chemical products.\nIn the demonstration, Mitsubishi Electric will connect the machine to a steam-generating boiler to test its effectiveness in capturing CO2 contained in boiler’s flue gas. The machine uses a solid adsorption method, whereby CO2 is adsorbed onto a solid adsorbent, which is then heated to release and recover the CO2 before CO2 reduction and other processes. Conventionally, CO2 from flue gas has been captured using liquid absorption. In this method, CO2 is absorbed by an aqueous solution of amine, a chemical substance mainly composed of nitrogen atoms that can absorb CO2 and release it when heated or decompressed. However, this method requires a large amount of energy to evaporate the aqueous solution, resulting in energy loss. The new solid adsorption method does not use this evaporation process, thereby reducing the energy required to capture CO2.\nIn the demonstration, Mitsubishi Electric will also enhance the energy efficiency of its comprehensive CCU system with technologies for advanced system design, advanced system control, and energy management, cultivated over many years in fields such as air conditioning, refrigeration and industrial systems.\nMitsubishi Electric and ITRI will use the results of this demonstration to accelerate research and development with the aim of realizing and deploying an integrated CCU system—from CO2 capture to utilization—in society at an early stage. Mitsubishi Electric will also combine this knowhow with its Energy & Facility (E&F) solutions to reduce CO2 emissions at plants and facilities to achieve carbon neutrality.\nGoing forward, with the goal of realizing sustainability, Mitsubishi Electric will continue to accelerate its “Trade-On” activities to simultaneously address technical issues in modern society and achieve business growth."

    "date": "July 18, 2025",
    "author": "Seabound",
    "content": "Seabound, a UK-based leader in marine carbon capture, has launched a first-of-its-kind onboard carbon capture project in partnership with Hartmann Group (\"Hartmann\"), InterMaritime Group (\"InterMaritime\"), and Heidelberg Materials Northern Europe. The solution equips the _UBC Cork_ , a 5,700 gross tonne (GT) cement-carrying ship owned by Hartmann and managed by InterMaritime, with Seabound's compact carbon capture system. The captured carbon — bound in limestone and thus stored safely onboard — will be offloaded at the Port of Brevik, Norway, and used in Heidelberg Materials' Brevik cement plant. Recently inaugurated, this world-first industrial-scale carbon capture facility in the cement industry will produce net-zero concrete. \nSeabound is deploying its compact marine carbon capture system aboard the UBC Cork (pictured), a 5,700 GT cement carrier owned by Hartmann Group, managed by InterMaritime Group, and chartered out to Heidelberg Materials. The captured carbon will be offloaded as limestone at the Port of Brevik, Norway, for use at Heidelberg Materials’ nearby cement plant.\nMarine shipping accounts for nearly 3% of global CO₂ emissions, making it one of the most carbon-intensive and difficult-to-decarbonize sectors. In April, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) introduced a global carbon price of up to $380 per tonne of CO₂, further adding pressure to shipowners. With few scalable alternatives to heavy fuel oil and existing efficiency measures proving insufficient, shipowners and global brands are seeking viable solutions to cut maritime emissions and meet ambitious climate goals.\nSeabound's containerized carbon capture system uses calcium looping technology to capture up to 95% of CO₂ and 98% of sulphur emissions from ship exhaust. The process uses calcium hydroxide, derived from calcium oxide and commonly known as slaked lime, to absorb CO₂ and convert it into limestone that is stored onboard until returning to port. The containerized system allows for easy installation with minimal vessel modification and is suitable for all vessel types. This design decouples carbon capture from post-processing, resulting in lower energy requirements, faster deployment, and reduced cost compared to traditional liquefied CO₂ systems.\n\"We're proud to partner with industry leaders like Heidelberg Materials and Hartmann to deliver scalable carbon capture solutions,\" said Alisha Fredriksson, CEO and Co-founder of Seabound. \"We're especially excited to be advancing this work in Brevik, a strategic location that's rapidly establishing itself as a global hub for CCS with Heidelberg's world-first facility and the Northern Lights pick up point. Together, we're demonstrating how onboard carbon capture can accelerate emissions reductions in carbon-intensive sectors.\"\nThe carbon captured on the _UBC Cork_ will be offloaded as limestone at Heidelberg Materials' Brevik plant, where it will serve as an input in the production of carbon captured cement, which enables net-zero concrete. The Brevik CCS facility is already operational, capturing 400,000 tons of CO2 annually. CO2 transport and storage are provided by Northern Lights, the world's first cross-border CO₂ storage hub beneath the North Sea. As part of its Net Zero strategy, Heidelberg Materials is committed to decarbonising their maritime transport and supply chain, targeting a substantial reduction in CO₂ emissions from 2020 levels.\n\"Shipping cement is emissions-intensive, and Seabound's system gives us a clear path to reduce those Scope 3 emissions while enhancing our circular use of captured CO₂,\" said Lars Erik Marcussen, Project Manager, Logistics at Heidelberg Materials Northern Europe. \"This project brings us one step closer to also decarbonising the logistics/transport part of our operations.\"\nThe collaboration marks a significant step forward, setting the stage for deeper cooperation between the partners. Heidelberg Materials aims to reduce its Scope 3 emissions from maritime transport by using a variety of methods — including Seabound's carbon capture technology — to accelerate its path to net-zero. Meanwhile, Hartmann's early adoption provides crucial operational expertise and strategically positions the company to meet evolving regulatory demands. Together, Seabound and Hartmann are committed to expanding carbon capture solutions throughout Hartmann's fleet, driving meaningful decarbonisation in maritime shipping.\n\"Hartmann is committed to embracing and investing in environmentally friendly technologies that reduce our maritime carbon footprint and promote sustainability,\" said Captain Jayant Singh, Director, Pool Manager Operations at Hartmann Group. \"By integrating innovative, eco-conscious solutions into our ship owning operations, we aim to contribute positively to the environment while delivering long-term value to the maritime industry and all of our stakeholders.\"\n\"This collaboration will play a key role in advancing carbon capture technology and accelerating its adoption in the shipping industry, marking a critical step toward realising a low-emission future for maritime transport,\" added Dieter Rohdenburg, CEO of Intership Navigation Co. Ltd., a member of InterMaritime.\nThe project is co-funded by the Eurostars partnership on Innovative SMEs which is part of Horizon Europe through the Cyprus Research and Innovation Foundation. This funding supports collaborative R&D projects that drive innovation in a range of industries, including maritime transport. The consortium of funding recipients supporting this initiative includes the Cyprus Marine and Maritime Institute (\"CMMI\"), a centre of excellence in maritime research with an interest in advancing new decarbonisation technologies. \nSeabound completed its first onboard carbon capture pilot with Lomar Shipping and Hapag Lloyd, successfully capturing CO₂ at ~80% efficiency onboard a 3,200 twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) container vessel. The company also showcased its technology for port-based emissions capture alongside STAX Engineering at an event in the Port of Long Beach, California in April. Building on this momentum, Seabound is currently building its first full-scale systems to be delivered initially to Hartmann and used in the transport of Heidelberg Materials' cement from the Brevik plant. Seabound is expanding its presence in Europe and leveraging favourable regulatory conditions to accelerate maritime decarbonisation.\nSeabound is on a mission to capture 100 million tonnes of CO₂ annually by 2040, representing 10% of the global shipping sector's emissions. The company continues to engage shipowners, cargo companies, and industrial players across the supply chain to expand adoption and maximize impact.

    "date": "May 1, 2025",
    "author": "Dr. Glenn Wilson",
    "content": "In many underground injection control operations, injection allocations across the reservoir interval are not measured and thus are unknown. This is further complicated for a fluid like supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) because injectivity is expected to vary significantly over time due to reservoir dynamics like pressure cycling and salt precipitation. If anything, these dynamics place a higher priority on storage operators measuring CO2 injectivity at the highest possible spatial resolution. This allows plume models to be optimally history-matched with time-lapse seismic imaging. The result is higher confidence in forecasting plume migration during and after injection operations.   \n  \nOver the past 15 years, the oil and gas industry has seen the rapid adoption of fiber optic sensing for downhole monitoring of distributed temperature and acoustic sensors along the entire wellbore for a wide variety of production and injection applications. Fiber optic cables installed behind casing or on tubing, along with injection and tubing pressure and temperature gauges, provide crucial downhole data about the reservoir dynamics. In unconventional wells, fluids and proppants were pumped in stages without any feedback about conformity or stimulated reservoir volume. This raised questions about where oil and gas production was really coming from. In recent years, fiber optic sensing has “turned on the lights” downhole. Its real-time analysis now advises on stimulation operations down to the perforation cluster interval, improving our understanding of where oil and gas are produced.\n**Wells Deploying Fiber Optics for Field-Scale Monitoring**  \nThe carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) industry has begun deploying fiber optic sensing in Class VI wells for measuring, reporting, and verification (MRV) of mechanical integrity testing and vertical seismic profiling (VSP). VSP provides time-lapsed images of the CO2 plume developing in the subsurface. Ideally, time-lapse VSP imaging should be calibrated with CO2 volumetrics. Without fiber optics, operators have limited sensing capabilities across the reservoir interval and require periodic interventions to evaluate well integrity. Certain unconventional and CCUS wells use similar perforated cased hole completions across the reservoir intervals. An opportunity exists to leverage the learning curve from unconventionals and quantify CO2 injection allocations down to the perforation cluster to help improve CCUS injection control operations and time-lapse VSP imaging of the CO2 plume.\n**Cluster Characterization Addresses Gaps**  \nHowever, a significant gap exists in MRV: the measurement of supercritical CO2 flow at the scale of the perforation cluster. In both research and practice, we still do not have the full picture of how CO2 is being dynamically allocated in CCUS wells during injection operations. Injection intervals can span hundreds to thousands of feet. This adds a layer of complexity when we try to determine where and how much CO2 is being injected into which formation and when. While injection logging provides some insights, they are only periodic snapshots and can alias temporal reservoir dynamics.  \n  \nHalliburton Jet Research Center in Alvarado, Texas includes perforation laboratories that are effectively at-scale, physical reservoir simulators for understanding production and injection operations. Studies are routinely performed to optimize the perforation designs to help maximize injection or production from a specific formation. This leads to an optimized design of service for in-field perforating operations and improved well productivity. Instrumentation for acoustic-based injectivity monitoring with distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) further augments those simulations to understand CO2 injectivity at reservoir temperature and pressure. We can develop unique relationships between the acoustic responses and supercritical fluid flow rates from well to formation via perforations at different pressures and temperatures.\n**Lab to the Field**  \nLearning from unconventionals, fiber optic sensing can turn on the lights for CCUS and quantify CO2 injection allocations. We can now perform at-scale simulations in the perforation laboratory to determine the expected acoustic responses for specific reservoirs, perforating designs, and injection operations. We can understand the acoustic response to individual CCUS operations a priori. When implemented in VISUM, our real-time downhole analysis software, this accelerated learning curve helps to deliver quantification of CO2 injection allocations at the perforation interval from the start-up of injection operations. This reduces the need for in-situ calibration with intervention operations. The improved understanding of reservoir dynamics helps improve our understanding of plume development and migration by calibrating time-lapse VSP images with CO2 volumetrics.   \n  \nTo learn more about how Halliburton helps companies overcome CCUS challenges, visit [www.halliburton.com/CCUS](https://www.halliburton.com/en/low-carbon-solutions/carbon-capture-utilization-storage).   \n  \nAuthor:   \nDr. Glenn Wilson, Head of Measurement,   \nReporting & Verification, Low Carbon Solutions"

    "date": "September 18, 2025",
    "author": "Boral Limited",
    "content": "Boral Limited (“Boral”) has successfully produced concrete made with recycled concrete aggregates that have been  \nrecarbonated via carbon capture technology from its integrated cement manufacturing plant.\n  \nThe trial, the first of its kind in Australia, saw recycled concrete aggregates from Boral’s Widemere  \nrecycling facility used as feedstock to capture and permanently store CO2 from the flue gas diverted  \nfrom Berrima Cement Works’ operations into its recently commissioned recarbonation-based carbon  \ncapture and storage (CCS) pilot plant. The recarbonated recycled aggregates resulting from this  \nprocess were then used to partially replace natural coarse aggregates in a low carbon concrete mix.\n  \nThis milestone demonstrates a viable pathway for using products from recarbonation-based carbon  \ncapture technology, which Boral is currently trialling at its Berrima cement plant.\n  \nOne of the unique properties of concrete is that it absorbs carbon dioxide through its service, life and  \nend of life phases. This process – cement recarbonation – occurs over many years. At end of life,  \nwhen structures containing concrete are demolished, the concrete is crushed, commonly into  \nrecycled concrete aggregates, and its exposed surface increases, accelerating the recarbonation  \nrate. The recarbonation process at Berrima CCS plant accelerates the natural carbonation of  \nrecycled aggregates by exposing them to controlled process conditions.\n  \nBoral’s concrete field trial was conducted at its Maldon cement manufacturing facility. The trial and  \nCCS pilot plant’s construction were jointly funded by the Federal Government’s Carbon Capture, Use  \nand Storage (CCUS) Development Fund and Boral. The project involved replacing 50 per cent of the  \nnatural coarse aggregates in Boral’s low-carbon Envisia® concrete with recarbonated recycled  \naggregates.\n  \nThe recarbonation CCS process offers a practical, low-cost solution for capturing and permanently  \nstoring carbon dioxide from cement manufacturing. Carbon capture, utilisation and storage is a  \ncritical decarbonisation lever for addressing process emissions, which account for approximately 65  \nper cent of carbon emissions in cement production.\n  \nDr Ali Nezhad, Head of Sustainability and Innovation at Boral, says: “We’re proud to lead the  \ndevelopment of utilisation pathways for recarbonated concrete aggregates. Its successful use not  \nonly enhances the viability of recarbonation-based carbon capture technology but also offers the  \npotential for a further reduction in the embodied carbon of concrete by replacing natural aggregates.  \nThe success of our carbon capture pilot plant at Berrima further validates the potential of  \nrecarbonation and underscores the importance of its broader recognition.”\n  \nVik Bansal, CEO and Managing Director at Boral, says “At Boral, we are committed to a lower-carbon  \nfuture, and we believe recarbonation will play an important role in decarbonising the cement  \nand concrete industry. The successful accelerated recarbonation of recycled concrete aggregates at  \nour CCS pilot plant at Berrima and utilisation of these aggregates in concrete further reinforce the  \npotential of this technology.\n  \n“Alongside our significant investments in alternative fuels and alternative materials to decarbonise  \nour cement manufacturing operations in the short term, we remain committed to exploring  \ntechnologies like carbon capture and storage as part of our long-term journey towards our net zero  \nambition by 2050.”\n  \nAs recognised in the Sixth Assessment Report of the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on  \nClimate Change (IPCC), carbon emissions from concrete and cement manufacturing are partially  \nabsorbed by concrete during the life cycle of concrete buildings and infrastructure. Studies estimate  \nthat the CO2 uptake through recarbonation of concrete could range from 20 per cent to 55 per cent of  \nprocess CO2 emissions during cement manufacturing."

    "date": "April 16, 2025",
    "author": "Vaisala",
    "content": "As the demand for scalable carbon capture technologies grows across industries, Vaisala sets a new standard for precision and efficiency in both direct air capture (DAC) and point source carbon capture with its innovative MPG241 multigas probe and comprehensive suite of CO2 measurement technologies.  \n  \nCO₂ measurement in carbon capture systems traditionally relies on large, complex extractive gas analyzers housed in bulky instrumentation racks with intricate pumping systems. Vaisala’s approach replaces cumbersome systems with compact, inline measurement instrumentation that delivers continuous, real-time data, minimizes maintenance and calibration, and dramatically reduces costs.  \n  \n“If you haven’t measured it, you haven’t captured it,” “said Antti Heikkilä, Vaisala’s Product Line Manager, Industrial Decarbonization. “By continuously providing precise, real-time CO₂ data at critical points in carbon capture processes, our solutions help operators optimize plant operations, reduce energy consumption, and ensure transparent emissions reporting,” continued Heikkilä. DAC and point source are fundamentally different approaches to carbon capture. DAC captures CO₂ molecules from the atmosphere, requiring the enrichment of CO₂ concentrations from approximately 420 parts per million to over 95% volume. Point source capture, in contrast, captures CO₂ emissions from industrial sources — power plants, cement kilns, steel mills, etc. — where CO₂ concentrations are already significantly higher.  \n  \nDespite these differences, the demand for precise measurement throughout the capture process endures as a unifying factor. Vaisala’s comprehensive CCUS product portfolio enables accurate monitoring at three key points: incoming gas, high-concentration product gas, and lean gas returning to the atmosphere. In both applications, real-time measurement allows operators to verify CO₂ removal rates and optimize plant performance using mass balance calculations, a critical tool as carbon capture operations scale up to millions of tons of CO₂ removal annually.  \n  \nTransforming measurement technology for a new era of carbon capture  \nFor DAC applications, Vaisala offers both ppm-level CO₂ measurement instruments and the MGP241 for high-concentration gas streams, ensuring accurate monitoring at every stage of the process. Precise CO₂ measurement helps evaluate sorbent efficiency, optimize adsorption-desorption cycles, and maintain energy efficiency. Additionally, Vaisala’s weather and environmental sensors provide fundamental environmental data — such as wind speed, humidity, and temperature — that impact DAC system performance.  \n  \nIn point source capture, the MGP241 provides in-line measurement at multiple locations, eliminating the need for complex extractive sampling systems.

    "content": "Sulzer has signed an agreement with KEZO (Zweckverband Kehrichtverwertung Zürcher Oberland), Zurich Oberland’s waste utilization service provider, to develop and deliver a licensed carbon capture solution for commercial validation at KEZO’s waste-to-energy plant in Hinwil. The goal is to assess integration feasibility with KEZO’s processes in preparation for its new municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) plant planned for 2030.\nMSWI plants incinerate non-recyclable waste to recover energy, diverting the waste from landfill and contributing to circular resource use. While efficient, the combustion process emits considerable carbon dioxide (CO₂). Integrating carbon capture technology can dramatically reduce these emissions, transforming waste utilization from a climate challenge to a climate solution. This is where Sulzer’s CO₂ solution comes into play.\nSulzer’s pre-assembled modular unit will be integrated at Hinwil’s waste-to-energy plant, where it will capture up to 1’000 tonnes of CO₂ annually from the flue gas. The captured carbon will then be utilized by a nearby greenhouse, demonstrating efficient, circular use of resources. This is a vital step in validating the technology’s commercial viability for KEZO’s planned new municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) plant. Pending validation, a scaled carbon capture unit can be integrated at the new MSWI facility to capture up to 120’000 tonnes of CO₂ annually, thereby supporting Switzerland’s net-zero ambitions.\nThe project is mainly financed by KEZO. The Canton of Zurich is also contributing to the financing. KEZO is making its infrastructure available and contributing its operating experience to gather important insights for the future large-scale plant.\nSulzer’s Executive Chairwoman Dr. Suzanne Thoma commented: “We are pleased to partner with KEZO, already a strong contributor to the circular economy, to advance carbon capture for waste-to-energy applications. This partnership demonstrates our shared commitment to innovation for transformative progress as we invest in tangible solutions that align environmental stewardship with economic development.”\nKEZO Managing Director Daniel Böni added: “This project shows how established industries like waste management can evolve to play a vital role in decarbonization through technology and strategic collaboration.”"

    "content": "Coastal Bend LNG, developer of a multi-train natural gas liquefaction and export facility along the Texas Gulf Coast, announced it has commenced a front-end engineering and design (FEED) study with Solvanic for electrochemically mediated amine regeneration (EMAR) carbon capture at its Coastal Bend LNG facility.\nSolvanic has signed an option agreement for use of the EMAR technology, originally developed by Professor T. Alan Hatton’s research group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Department of Chemical Engineering. The technology uses an electrochemical process to release carbon dioxide (CO2) captured by amines with electricity, rather than high temperature steam traditionally used in thermal amine systems. This innovative approach reduces the energy requirements and capital costs for carbon capture and enables much greater flexibility across operating conditions and process scales. The EMAR technology has been in development at MIT for over a decade, with recent breakthroughs by Dr. Michael Massen-Hane and Dr. Michael Nitzsche, paving the way for emissions reductions that were previously infeasible. Drs. Massen-Hane and Nitzsche have since become co-founders of Solvanic to scale the technology into industry and maximize their climate impacts.\n“To deliver on our ambitious low carbon intensity LNG goals, we need to capture carbon dioxide emissions from both our natural gas pretreatment and cogeneration facilities,” said Nick Flores, Chief Executive Officer, Coastal Bend LNG. “For post-combustion capture on our onsite cogeneration facilities, we need a step change in carbon capture efficiency. We’re highly encouraged by Solvanic’s preliminary techno-economics and are keen to accelerate their technology readiness with this FEED study.”\n“We have demonstrated our EMAR solution to Technology Readiness Level 4 with low energetics, high stability, and modular scalability across emission sources,” said Dr. Michael Nitzsche, Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer, Solvanic. He added, “This FEED study accelerates our techno-economic analyses for gas processing and post-combustion carbon capture with the full engineering support of Coastal Bend LNG and their contractors.”\n“We are leveraging over a decade of electrochemical carbon capture research and development at MIT via this option agreement. We appreciate Coastal Bend LNG’s confidence in the technology to meet their industrial decarbonization objectives,” said Dr. Michael Massen-Hane, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Solvanic."

    "content": "Chemists at the University of Copenhagen have developed a method to convert plastic waste into a climate solution for efficient and sustainable CO2 capture. This is killing two birds with one stone as they address two of the world’s biggest challenges: plastic pollution and the climate crisis.\n\"The beauty of this method is that we solve a problem without creating a new one. By turning waste into a raw material that can actively reduce greenhouse gases, we make an environmental issue part of the solution to the climate crisis,” says Margarita Poderyte.\nAs CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere keep rising regardless of years of political intentions to limit emissions, the world’s oceans are drowning in plastics, which threatens marine environments and ecosystems.\nThe key global problems are often interconnected, and typically, the solution to one problem creates another one while the clock keeps ticking. But what if we could solve several problems at the same time?\nIt’s almost too good to be true, but a new cutting-edge invention promises to do just that. Researchers at the University of Copenhagen have developed a method where one man’s trash really does become another man’s “treasure”, when decomposed PET plastic becomes the main ingredient in efficient and sustainable CO2 capture.\nWe know the material from plastic bottles, textiles, and many other uses: PET plastic is one of the most widely used types of plastic in the world, but when it has served its purpose, it becomes a pressing global environmental issue. This is because it ends up in landfills in many parts of the world, where it breaks down into polluting microplastics that spread to the air, soil and groundwater. A large portion also end up in the oceans.\n“The beauty of this method is that we solve a problem without creating a new one. By turning waste into a raw material that can actively reduce greenhouse gases, we make an environmental issue part of the solution to the climate crisis,” says Margarita Poderyte from the Department of Chemistry at the University of Copenhagen, lead author of the research paper disclosing the invention.\nThe solution is a potential win-win on a global scale, where plastic waste not only does not end up in nature but also becomes an active player in climate mitigation.\nWith the new chemical technology, researchers can transform PET plastic waste that is overlooked by recyclers into a primary resource in a new form of CO2 sorbent they have developed. The process ‘upcycles’ it to a new material the researchers have named BAETA, which can absorb CO2 out of the atmosphere so efficiently that it easily compares with existing carbon capture technologies."

    "content": "Clean Refineries Inc., and Eden Carbon Solutions Pty Ltd announced a groundbreaking partnership that will transform how refineries convert carbon dioxide emissions into valuable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The partnership grants GFO exclusive North American rights to Eden's proven carbon capture and synthesis technology, positioning the companies to revolutionize fuel production across the continent.\nThe partnership combines Clean Refineries’ Net-Zero Emissions Technology (NZET) with Eden's advanced CO₂-to-fuel conversion system, creating a revolutionary approach to sustainable fuel production.\nThe patented technology Eden utilizes operates through a three-stage process that captures and converts CO₂ into premium transportation fuels. The system uses Hot Potassium Carbonate (HPC) absorption technology—proven in hundreds of industrial installations—to capture over 95% of CO₂ emissions from flue gases at dramatically lower energy costs than traditional methods.\n\"Our technology captures carbon dioxide and converts it into high-performance fuels using hydrogen and precision-engineered chemical pathways—delivering a scalable, infrastructure-ready solution for deep decarbonization,\" explained Gavin Rodel, CEO of Eden Carbon Solutions. \"We capture CO₂ from any source—whether it’s our partner’s refinery or a nearby cement plant—and combine it with renewable hydrogen to create the building blocks for ultra-clean jet fuel.\"\nClean Refineries’ NZET technology provides the ideal foundation for Eden integration. Unlike conventional refineries that boil oil at extreme temperatures over 1,000°F with massive energy requirements, NZET facilities use precision molecular separation in a low-temperature closed-loop, zero-toxic-emission design.\n\"The NZET system already achieves an unprecedented emission reduction compared to traditional refining,\" stated Derek Williamson, CEO of Green Fuels Operations. \"By integrating Eden's technology, we’re not just eliminating our remaining emissions—we’re becoming carbon sinks that actively remove CO₂ from the atmosphere while producing premium fuels.\"\nConsider a typical deployment: A 20,000 barrel-per-day NZET refinery integrated with Eden technology could process CO₂ from a nearby coal plant, converting what would be 2.2 million tons of annual emissions into approximately 220 million gallons of feedstock for high-value SAF production.\nMarket Transformation at Scale\nWith exclusive rights across Mexico, Canada, and the United States, the partnership addresses a massive market opportunity. North America's industrial sector emits over 6.8 billion tons of CO₂ annually, while airlines desperately seek sustainable fuel supplies to meet regulatory mandates and corporate commitments.\n\"This partnership doesn’t just solve one problem—it solves three,\" noted Williamson. \"We help heavy industry manage their carbon liabilities, provide airlines with certified sustainable fuel, and create a profitable new business model for refineries. It’s a true win-win-win scenario.\"\nImmediate Implementation Plans:\nThe first integrated facilities are planned for development within 24 months, with sites under evaluation in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Alberta. Each location has been selected for proximity to both CO₂-intensive industries and aviation fuel markets, ensuring efficient aggregation and distribution."

    "content": "In the face of economic uncertainty, diversifying carbon capture technology will help keep Canada’s industry competitive globally. Expanding the range of carbon capture, utilization and storage options available to companies will increase adoption and reduce the cost of this essential technology.   \n  \nCanada is entering a time of economic uncertainty. Many discussions have centered around the need to increase the productivity of Canada’s industries to remain competitive on a global stage. The energy industry has been looking across its operations to find ways to cut costs while maintaining efficiency and environmental performance.  \n  \nThere have been many conversations about various aspects of production, but finding ways to bring costs down when it comes to emissions reduction is essential to the industry remaining competitive globally. Carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) technology is a big part of that conversation.  \n  \nIn late January, it was announced that InnoTech Alberta would receive a total of $4.5 million from Natural Resources Canada, the government of Alberta and industry to improve the energy and cost efficiency of the leading carbon capture technology, and this has Alberta’s energy industry talking. They already see the potential for this and other emerging commercial CCUS technologies to be integrated into their operations, reducing the emissions intensity of energy production. However, the next stage of that conversation is often more complicated. Commercially available carbon capture technology is still too expensive for widespread adoption.   \n  \nWe know that the use of existing commercially available technology will allow the industry to make progress on reducing emissions for targeted parts of their operations, but, more variations and options in CCUS technologies are going to be needed to make further significant emissions reductions possible in the future.  \n  \nInvesting in the adoption of current CCUS technology isn’t the only answer. We can (and should) invest in diversifying the types of technologies available for adoption. That’s where InnoTech Alberta comes in. As Alberta's leading research and technology organization, we ensure that Alberta is always one step ahead by providing innovative solutions to global challenges facing industries, businesses and the public sector.  \n  \nCurrently, there is only one widely available type of carbon capture technology and only a few technology vendors provide it globally. Not only does that make the technology expensive, but it also means that this single technology must fit all needs.   \n  \nIncreased competition will help CCUS technology improve. For example, increasing the number of alternative fuel vehicles available for purchase, including those relying on hydrogen, is increasing competition and reducing the up-front costs for consumers. They offer a range of fuel options that fit consumers’ diverse needs. The same supply-and-demand equation will be true on an industrial scale for CCUS. InnoTech is helping speed that process along.  \n  \nBy connecting with technology developers and users, we are identifying the emerging challenges the industry faces, allowing us to identify and kick-start the development of new solutions that will help reduce and capture emissions while lowering costs.  \n  \nOur work in this space is already making an impact. The $4.5 million in funding provided by the Government of Alberta, NRCan and industry will enable us to evaluate a new, more cost-effective and energy-efficient version of the existing amine carbon capture process, the most widely available carbon capture technology. A new technology that captures and stores emissions directly from the exhaust stacks of heavy haulers is ready to be tested in the field as well. And we’re also looking way outside the box; our team is developing brand-new technologies that reduce the need to capture carbon at all.  \n  \nNot all these technologies will make it into the field, but expanding the range of potential options available is the first step to diversifying any market. By spurring their development now, we are ensuring that enough of these technologies will be available to help the industry continue to reduce emissions into the future. If there were ever a time for work like this, it’s now."

    "content": "Many climate commitments are slated to come due between 2030-2050, and voluntary carbon market (VCM) skeptics have speculated that as those dates draw closer – and pressure mounts – intimidated companies will withdraw their pledges.\nWhile it’s true a few organizations have backtracked within the past year, I’m happy to report the VCM isn’t just surviving – it’s doing better than ever.\nThe first quarter of 2025 shows via engineered removal transactions that the voluntary carbon market is quickly nearing a tipping point as bigger deals continued to punctuate the growth narrative, a greater variety of removals were involved in transactions, and more suppliers and buyers broadened participation in the market.\nThese strong indicators of robust market growth could not be timelier. [ Energy demand broke records in 2024](https://www.iea.org/news/growth-in-global-energy-demand-surged-in-2024-to-almost-twice-its-recent-average), and projections estimate [energy demand will grow by 4% annually through 2027](https://www.iea.org/news/growth-in-global-electricity-demand-is-set-to-accelerate-in-the-coming-years-as-power-hungry-sectors-expand). Utilities are [delaying coal plant retirements](https://www.powermag.com/u-s-coal-plants-get-reprieve-as-market-and-policies-change/) and ordering [more natural gas turbines](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/u-s-needs-more-power-for-aibut-critical-equipment-is-pricey-and-scarce-8df92c2e?st=qakhdq&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) to meet the growing demand, giving fossil fuel a resurgence despite the associated emissions profile. The [European Environment Agency says more must be done](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/faster-progress-needed-stay-within-planetary-boundaries-2025-02-20_en) to meet 2030 climate goals. With just five years to this significant milestone, all efforts should be focused on supporting existing targets. \nHere is a closer look at four key insights* from the first quarter’s activity.\n**Q1 2025 Insight #1: Bigger deals, but fewer of them**\nThe first quarter of 2025 marked the highest Q1 volume in recorded history for VCM** engineered removals, despite the number of deals shrinking. This continues a trend [first spotted in 2024](https://elimini.com/news/key-insights-from-the-2024-voluntary-carbon-market) and signals the market maturing into one where megadeals from climate-forward corporates are leading the charge. Nearly half of all Q1 engineered volume was contracted in January alone, stemming from just three landmark transactions:\n  * [SkiesFifty purchased 200,000 tons](https://www.skiesfifty.com/news-and-information/gigablue-agreement) of direct ocean removal (DOR) from Gigablue\n  * [Google purchased 100,000 tons](https://blog.google/feed/were-announcing-our-first-partnerships-to-scale-biochar-for-co2-removal/) of biochar from Varaha\n  * [Google purchased 100,000 tons](https://blog.google/feed/were-announcing-our-first-partnerships-to-scale-biochar-for-co2-removal/) of biochar from Charm Industrial\n\nTogether, these three purchases accounted for 400,000 tons of removals, cementing Q1 as a period of concentrated but high-impact action.\nWhile fewer deals may suggest a narrower buyer base, the size and ambition of these agreements point toward a future where fewer, larger players are willing to stake bold claims in climate mitigation efforts – especially as scrutiny around net-zero commitments intensifies.\n**Q1 2025 Insight #2: Market diversification picks up steam**\nIn the first quarter, the types of permanent carbon removals represented as part of these engineered transactions diversified noticeably. Biochar has surged to become the third-largest removal method by contracted volume, aided by players like Charm Industrial expanding their offerings beyond their initial bio-oil technology.\nDirect ocean removal also gained momentum, rising to the fourth-highest contracted method by volume and further validating its viability as a scalable removal pathway, while biomass storage also recorded 33 transactions in Q1. \nWhile this is simply a snapshot, longer-term trends toward diversification are critical. As no single removal technology will scale fast enough to meet climate goals alone, a mixed portfolio approach from buyers signals a healthy and evolving market, open to innovation and adaptation.\n**Q1 2025 Insight #3: More players enter the arena**\nThe first quarter also welcomed 16 first-time buyers, outpacing the 13 new buyers who entered during the same period last year. These included a Norwegian bank, a sustainable aviation company and even TikTok joining the market for the first time. \nThe quarter also saw five new suppliers, compared to three in the first quarter in 2024, showing growth on both sides of the “desk”. While it’s highly unlikely this will be enough to meet anticipated demand for the foreseeable future, it could increase competition. \nWhile the number of transactions shrunk, the increase in players shows growing confidence in the market as new corporates, project developers, and investors engage with carbon removals in earnest.\n**Q1 2025 Insight #4: Less pricing transparency, despite customer requests**\nAt the same time that participation has broadened through these large transactions, pricing transparency has continued declining. Buyers only disclosed pricing information for two deals in Q1 2025, compared to 20 in Q1 2024. This lack of transparency denotes the large, project-specific transactions that have occurred, which don’t necessarily contribute to price standardization.\nFrontier – whose mission is to help accelerate new carbon removal technologies by providing demand for them – remains an outlier here by publishing 100% of its transaction prices. This transparency is in line with Frontier’s mission to help create new carbon supply, rather than compete against what exists today, and as such, it is anticipated Frontier will continue providing this transparency. \nWhile customers may desire more price transparency to help ensure they’re securing a fair deal, the aforementioned downtrend is likely to continue as bilateral transactions tied to large, bespoke projects continue to comprise an increasing share of the durable removals market. \n**Where’s the BECCS?**\nBy the end of 2024, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) was the breakout engineered removal pathway, dominating the top five deals and achieving an 84% increase in total contracted volume relative to 2023. But in Q1 2025, BECCS got off to a slow start, with only one of the top five deals tied to the method.\nDoes this mean BECCS is losing momentum? Not necessarily.\nThe answer lies in the evolving deal structure of the VCM. As we’ve seen already in Q2, a small number of very large deals can significantly shift the rankings by removal method. This volatility means quarterly snapshots may not fully reflect long-term trajectories.\nFor example, in the early days of Q2, the market has already experienced a reshuffle. On April 15, [Microsoft announced the largest CDR purchase](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/microsoft-signs-large-carbon-removal-deal-backing-atmosclears-louisiana-project-2025-04-15/) in history – tied to BECCS. This landmark deal is expected to significantly alter the composition of the market for the remainder of the year.\n**Looking ahead**\nThe first quarter of 2025 affirms that the voluntary carbon market for engineered removals is maturing in complexity, scale, and diversity. More players are entering the space, deals are growing in volume, and the range of viable removal technologies is expanding.\nYet, challenges remain. Price opacity threatens trust, and fluctuating deal structures complicate efforts to track progress by removal type.\nStill, the momentum is real – and the need for scalable carbon removal is only increasing. For companies like [Elimini](https://elimini.com/) and our peers across the VCM, the road ahead is about translating this momentum into durable infrastructure, trusted partnerships, and enduring climate impact.\n_* **Source** : CDR.fyi to March 31, 2025_\n_**Note: CDR.fyi_[ _reported a quieter Q1_](https://www.cdr.fyi/blog/2025-q1-durable-cdr-market-update-back-at-basecamp) _due to three deals that were contracted in December. To maintain consistency, we’ve credited those deals according to when they were announced – which falls in Q1 2025._"

    "content": "United Living Group, solutions provider to the UK’s critical infrastructure, announced that its subsidiary, United Living Energy Limited, part of its Infrastructure Services business (ULIS), has been selected by Liverpool Bay CCS Limited (LBCCS), a member of the global energy-tech company, Eni, as one of the primary contractors to deliver CO2 Transportation and Storage (T&S) infrastructure. The ULIS project is worth approximately £250 million over a three-year period.\nThis facility will be instrumental in enabling the landmark HyNet CO₂ pipeline, which aims to unlock a low carbon economy for the north west of England and north Wales. The pipeline will be the first step in unlocking the benefits and ambitions of the wider HyNet North West project and achieving the UK’s net zero target by 2050.\nThe HyNet CO₂ pipeline will take CO2 captured by industrial emitters across the region and transport it through new and repurposed infrastructure to permanent storage in depleted natural gas reservoirs under the seabed in Liverpool Bay.\nULIS has been chosen by LBCCS to work on the pipeline as part of an engineering, procurement, installation, and commissioning (EPIC) project. The pipeline will start in Ince, Cheshire, and ULIS will cover over 34 km of new pipeline, part of its Infrastructure Services business, in conjunction with 24 km of existing pipeline, which will finish in Point of Ayr, North Wales.\nLBCCS was granted a Development Consent Order (DCO) in March 2024 by the UK Government’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero to carry out the construction, operation, and maintenance of infrastructure to transport CO₂ as part of the HyNet industrial cluster.\nThe transportation and storage infrastructure has the potential to be a major contributor to the UK’s decarbonisation and net zero storage goals. In the first phase, it will have the capacity to transport 4.5 million tonnes of CO₂ per year, with the potential to increase to up to 10 million tonnes of CO₂ per year in the 2030s.\nUnited Living is a well-established regional employer that has already created 50 jobs and expects to generate a further 300 roles working on this project over the next two years. The immediate supply chain will also be generating an additional 300 roles. This highlights its commitment to developing local skills and engaging with the community.\n**Neil Armstrong, Chairman and CEO of United Living Group, commented:**\n“We are incredibly excited about the potential of this CO2 Transportation and Storage (T&S) infrastructure project and the positive impact it will have on CO₂ emission reduction. We are acutely aware of the pressing need to transition to a lower-carbon future and see CCS as a crucial element to the UK achieving its net-zero target.\n“This project will also deliver huge benefits to the North West region, bringing major investment in local skills development, employment opportunities, and strong growth prospects for local businesses.”"

    "author": "David Elam",
    "content": "There are approximately 8,500 kilometers of carbon dioxide (CO2) pipelines in the United States today, primarily in place to serve the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) market. In 2021, researchers from Princeton University analyzed five pathways to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Expansion of carbon dioxide capture, transport, usage and storage was identified as a requirement for each pathway with one pathway forecasting a need for approximately 106,000 kilometers of carbon dioxide pipeline by 2050. The study acknowledged the challenges of permitting all infrastructure projects, but did not discuss the importance of pipeline safety with respect to permitting carbon dioxide and transport and storage projects.  \n  \nThe construction and operation of carbon dioxide pipelines in the U.S. date to the 1980s and have been subject to manageable permitting challenges and characterized by few accidents. On Feb. 22, 2020, however, a pipeline transporting supercritical carbon dioxide ruptured near Satartia, Mississippi, resulting in the release of approximately 31,400 barrels of carbon dioxide (approximately 3,640 metric tons) requiring the evacuation of approximately 200 residents and sending 45 individuals to the hospital for treatment. Excluding the Satartia accident, over the 10-year period from 2010 to 2021, 66 accidents on pipelines transporting supercritical-phase carbon dioxide have been reported to the Pipeline Safety and Hazardous Materials Administration (PHMSA). The average release of carbon dioxide for these 66 accidents was 920 barrels (approximately 110 metric tons) and no accident resulted in fatalities or injuries regarding hospitalization. The Satartia accident dwarfed the historical average by more than 30-fold, a troublesome statistic considering the of importance carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) with respect to net zero goals.  \n  \nThe magnitude and severity of the Satartia event gained national attention and prompted PHMSA to undertake a deliberate approach to regulate carbon dioxide pipeline safety in the U.S. PHMSA investigated the Satartia carbon dioxide pipeline and reported the issues leading to the pipeline failure and the problems associated with prompt response to the incident. Based on those findings, on April 8, 2022, PHMSA issued a rule requiring new or reconstructed carbon dioxide pipelines to install remote or automatic shutoff valves in rare instances of pipeline failure. PHMSA then scheduled a meeting in Des Moines, Iowa, from May 31 through June 1, 2023, to obtain public comment on carbon dioxide pipeline safety. After analyzing both the PHMSA Failure Investigation Report for the Satartia accident and public comments, PHMSA submitted a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for carbon dioxide pipelines to the Office of Management and Budget for review on February 1, 2024. On January 10, 2025, PHMSA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for carbon dioxide pipelines.  \n  \nThe NPRM, although withdrawn by presidential executive order, remains instructive about the future regulation of carbon dioxide pipelines in the U.S. In summary, the proposed regulations would have modified regulations found at 49 CFR 195 (Transportation of Hazardous Liquids by Pipeline) governing highly volatile liquids (HVLs, including carbon dioxide) in 18 areas, 16 of which are directly related to carbon dioxide pipelines as summarized below:  \n  \n1. The definition of carbon dioxide would have been amended to (1) include not only supercritical-phase carbon dioxide but also carbon dioxide in the gas and liquid phases, and (2) lower the threshold of carbon dioxide molecules present in the product stream (in any phase) necessary for a pipeline to be considered a “carbon dioxide” pipeline subject to greater than 50% of the molecules in the product stream.  \n  \n2. Operators of carbon dioxide pipelines would have needed to perform vapor dispersion analyses to determine whether a release from their pipelines “could affect” a high consequence area (HCA) and would therefore be subject to integrity management program requirements. If the pipeline operator determined that its pipeline could affect an HCA, it would have been required to install fixed vapor detection and alarm systems and consider installation of emergency flow restricting devices.  \n  \n3. In excavated trenches, operators of regulated pipelines would have had to have instruments and tools capable of detecting hazardous concentrations of hazardous liquids, carbon dioxide, and any known deleterious constituents in the product stream. This proposed rule would have also required carbon dioxide pipeline operators to provide equipment, instruments, tools and materials that might be used in the event of an emergency on a carbon dioxide pipeline to local emergency response organizations and train them on their proper use.  \n  \n4. Onshore carbon dioxide pipeline operators would have been required to communicate with affected entities (including, but not limited to the public) during a carbon dioxide pipeline emergency as soon as practicable during an emergency.  \n  \n5. Carbon dioxide pipelines constructed, replaced, relocated or otherwise changed after the effective date of the regulation would have required enhanced design to mitigate fracture propagation through the pipe.  \n  \n6. All spike hydrostatic testing requirements would have been consolidated in a single section. Additionally, new hydrostatic pressure testing requirements would have been established.  \n  \n7. Carbon dioxide would have been removed from the list of acceptable test mediums for spike hydrostatic testing.  \n  \n8. Enhanced conversion to service requirements for pipelines converted to carbon dioxide service would have been established.  \n  \n9. Enhanced right-of-way surface condition inspection requirements would have been established to require carbon dioxide pipeline operators to look for indicators of leakage from the pipeline, geologic hazards in the area that could affect the pipeline, nearby construction activity, areas of reduced depth of cover, and any other factors that may affect safety and operation.  \n  \n10. An additional depth of cover classification for agricultural areas would have been established requiring regulated pipelines to be installed so that the cover between the top of the pipe and the ground level, roadbed, river bottom or underwater natural bottom would comply with a minimum depth of 48 inches for normal excavation in agricultural areas.  \n  \n11. Leak detection systems would have been required for carbon dioxide pipelines built, replaced or relocated after the effective date. Carbon dioxide pipelines existing on the effective date of any final rule would have had four years from that effective date to implement leak detection system requirements.  \n  \n12. Fixed vapor detection and alarm systems would have been required at each pump station, compressor station, meter station and valve station.  \n  \n13. Carbon dioxide pipeline operators would have had to consider deleterious constituents (e.g., water and hydrogen sulfide) for assessment scheduling, information analysis and risk analysis.  \n  \n14. Carbon dioxide pipeline operators would have had to establish a monitoring and mitigation program for constituents within carbon dioxide product streams that can affect corrosion, including microbes, water, oxygen, methane, hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, and nitrous oxides.   \n  \n15. The distance-based reporting exception for safety-related conditions would have been eliminated.  \n  \n16. Carbon dioxide pipeline operators would have been required to establish emergency planning zones extending two miles on either side of their pipelines to enable operators to adequately identify those community members requiring emergency response information.  \n  \nThe Satartia event galvanized both pipeline and CCUS opponents who have been able to swiftly and systematically challenge carbon dioxide pipeline safety. The efforts of these groups have significantly contributed to Navigator CO2 Ventures’ decision to terminate its Heartland Greenway pipeline and to Summit Carbon Solutions’ decision to suspend carbon dioxide pipeline efforts in South Dakota. The Navigator pipeline would have collected carbon dioxide from ethanol plants in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota for storage underground at Mt. Simon sandstone formation in central Illinois. The Summit pipeline was designed to collect carbon dioxide from biofuel plants in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota for deep underground storage in North Dakota.  \nThe Pipeline Safety Trust, a nonprofit public charity promoting pipeline safety through education and advocacy, reviewed the proposed rule favorably noting that it had incorporated many of the lessons learned from the Satartia accident. It criticized the proposed rule for not including a requirement for an odorant in carbon dioxide pipelines and for not including performance standards for leak detection equipment.  \n  \nUnfortunately, the advancement of this rule has been delayed. The public comment period would have drawn comments from carbon dioxide pipeline operators, carbon dioxide pipeline and CCUS opponents, and CCUS advocates and resulted in a rule intended to protect the public while allowing the advancement of carbon capture pipelines and storage reservoirs. In the absence of carbon dioxide pipeline safety regulations, pipeline and CCUS opponents control the narrative. As advocates for safe, reliable and full-scale CCUS, we must engage our elected officials to direct PHMSA to return its attention to carbon dioxide pipeline safety and build on the solid work it has already done.\n_References available upon request._  \n  \nAuthor:   \nDavid Elam, TRC Companies  \ndelam@trccompanies.com  \n919-967-0500"

    "date": "September 4, 2025",
    "author": "Equinor",
    "content": "The first CO₂ volumes have now been injected and successfully stored in the reservoir 2.600 meters under the seabed. The world’s first third party CO2 transport and storage facility is now in operation, contributing to reducing European greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe CO2 is transported via ships from Heidelberg Materials’ cement factory in Brevik. The CO2 is then offloaded and transported through a 100-kilometer pipeline and injected into the Aurora reservoir under the seabed of the North Sea.\n“With CO2 safely stored below the seabed, we mark a major milestone. This demonstrates the viability of carbon capture, transport and storage as a scalable industry. With the support from the Norwegian government and in close collaboration with our partners, we have successfully transformed this project from concept to reality,” says CEO of Equinor, Anders Opedal.\nThe Northern Lights Joint Venture is equally owned by Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies. Equinor, as the Technical Service Provider (TSP), has been responsible for the construction of the Øygarden facility and the offshore facilities on behalf of the Northern Lights JV, and will also have operational responsibility of the CO2 plant.\n“Lifting new value chains like CO2 capture, transport and storage requires collaboration and effort across the value chain - from governments, industry and customers. With Northern Lights in operation, we have proven that this is possible. Now, we look forward to leading safe and efficient operations on behalf of the Northern Lights partnership and use this as a stepping stone for the further development of CCS in Europe,” says Irene Rummelhoff, Executive Vice President of MMP in Equinor.\nThe commenced injection of CO2 completes the phase 1 of the development, which has a total capacity of 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 per year (mtpa). The capacity of this phase is fully booked.\nIn March, the owners of Northern Lights made the final investment decision for the phase 2 of the development, which will increase transport and storage capacity to a minimum of 5 million tonnes of CO2 per year. This decision was made possible after signing of an agreement to transport and store up to 900,000 tonnes CO2 annually from Stockholm Exergi. The expansion is enabled by a grant from the Connecting Europe Facility for Energy (CEF Energy) funding scheme.\nThe expansion of Northern Lights builds on existing infrastructure and includes additional onshore storage tanks, a new jetty, and additional injection wells. The development of phase 2 with Equinor as TSP is well underway, with the delivery of nine new CO2 storage tanks at the Øygarden site this summer.\nEquinor is already one of the largest CCS developers worldwide and has an ambition of having 30-50 million tonnes per annum of CO2 transport and storage capacity by 2035. To achieve this, Equinor is working on several CCS projects in Europe and the US. These projects require a conducive policy framework and collaboration between governments, industry, customers and regulators."

    "date": "May 1, 2025",
    "author": "HYCO1 Inc.",
    "content": "HYCO1, Inc. and Malaysia LNG Sdn. Bhd. (MLNG) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to collaborate on the potential utilization and conversion of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) into chemical and fuel products, setting new standards for sustainability and innovation. The signing was between Gregory Carr, CEO of HYCO1, Inc., and Mohamed Syazwan Abdullah @ Laga Jenggi, Managing Director & CEO, Malaysia LNG Group of Companies. The Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) Project will be located in Bintulu, Sarawak, Malaysia, the home of Malaysia LNG Sdn. Bhd. (MLNG; a subsidiary of PETRONAS), which is the CO2 supplier for the project. \nCentral to this initiative is HYCO1’s breakthrough CUBE™ Technology, which uses CO2 as a primary feedstock to displace higher cost natural gas to produce equivalent industrial-grade syngas in customizable ratios of hydrogen (H2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO). Under the MOU, HYCO1 and MLNG will conduct a joint feasibility study to evaluate design alternatives to produce low-cost, low-carbon syngas that best meets demand from a wide range of potential downstream syngas users. By transforming CO2 from an emissions waste gas into much-needed chemical and fuel products, this project sets a new standard for sustainability and innovation. By using lower-cost CO2 feedgas to displace higher-cost natural gas, the HYCO1 CUBE™ process will disruptively produce lower CI, “blue”, emissions free syngas for less than the cost of today’s “gray” syngas made from using natural gas. The CCU plant is expected to be completed by 2029. \n“This is very exciting for all stakeholders, including HYCO1 and MLNG and will benefit all Malaysians,” Gregory Carr shared. “We feel honored to collaborate with MLNG to support their Net Zero Carbon Emissions (NZCE) by 2050 aspirations. Our revolutionary process and catalyst are game changers in decarbonization because not only do we prevent CO2 from being emitted into the atmosphere, but we transform it into highly valuable and usable downstream products,” says Mr. Carr. \nThis landmark MOU marks the launch of work on what HYCO1 and MLNG expect to become one of the largest CO2 utilization projects in history. Unlike traditional efforts focused solely on CO2 capture and high-cost sequestration (Carbon Capture and Sequestration, CCS), this project pioneers a new approach by fully utilizing captured CO2 emissions to profitably and competitively generate valuable products. \nThis project is a testament that profitably achieving net-zero emissions without a cost penalty is not only a realistic goal at large scale but also an opportunity to drive innovation and create economic value.\n**About HYCO1**\nHYCO1 is the only CO2 utilization company in the world that cost-effectively captures industrial CO2 emissions from the source and turns them into high-value, sustainable products at lower cost than today’s gray processes and without the need for government incentives. HYCO1 reformers are designed to convert 100% of the CO2 feed gas into valuable syngas.\nHYCO1 CUBE™ Technology (Carbon Utilization. Best Efficiency.) converts and utilizes nearly 100% of CO2 feed in a single reactor pass, resulting in low-cost, low-CI, high-grade syngas (H2 and CO) at commercial scale. Such major energy transition milestones have never been achieved before. HYCO1 provides a new way for industrial companies to repurpose their CO2 emissions from being a costly burden to new, profitable, and sustainable products."

CarbonQuest’s point-source carbon capture technology captures carbon emissions from the customer’s facility before they are released into the atmosphere, then liquifies the captured CO2 on-site. The CO2 is purified to [ISBT standard](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.isbt.com%2F&esheet=54263921&newsitemid=20250603991742&lan=en-US&anchor=ISBT+standard&index=2&md5=755a297d7d5247aba2a83d65fabfdf4d) beverage grade, which is recycled on-site by the facility for use in its product. This project will capture an estimated 22,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions over a 15-year period.\nLiquid CO2 is an essential ingredient in the food and beverage industry as it is used for carbonation, chilling, bottling processes, and maintaining product freshness and quality. Traditionally, commercial CO2 is sourced from ethanol, gas refining, or ammonia. For most regions in the U.S., the product is hauled over long distances, generating additional CO2 emissions. Moreover, supply shortages and fluctuations in the last five years have left customers vulnerable to significant price increases, production disruptions, and quota curtailments.\nCarbonQuest’s point-source carbon capture and reuse system enables industrial customers to meet or supplement their CO2 supply through recycled CO2 from their own facilities, turning “waste” into a critical supply chain product. Beyond security of supply and pricing stability, implementation of CarbonQuest’s technology reduces a customer’s scope 1 emissions (via captured emissions generated from the facility) and scope 3 emissions (via reduced emissions in the supply chain for long distance hauls of their product), and may also reduce costs associated with the purchase of CO2 from outside sources.\n“We’re excited about entering this integral market in the CO2 reuse space by providing food and beverage-grade CO2 as a service,” said Shane Johnson, CEO and President of CarbonQuest. “This offering will help industrial companies remove themselves from the volatility of the CO2 market while meeting the sustainability needs of their customers, exemplifying the benefits of taking part in the circular carbon economy.”\nCarbonQuest’s DCCS™ technology is modular, has a small physical footprint, and uses cutting-edge solid sorbents that allow for CO2 capture in space-constrained settings. It is suitable for the majority of industrial facilities, utility infrastructure, food and beverage processing plants, and campus settings with onsite power generation, such as Combined Heat and Power (CHP) and fuel cells.

    "content": "LG Chem announced that it will carry out a demonstration project for CCU (Carbon Capture and Utilization) technology, jointly involving the chemical and steel industries, as part of the Ministry of Science and ICT’s national CCU Mega Project.\nUnder the project, carbon dioxide captured at POSCO’s Pohang steelworks will be converted into carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen, which are used as reducing agents* in steelmaking, via LG Chem’s proprietary DRM (Dry Reforming of Methane) technology.\n*Reducing agent: A substance used to extract pure metal from metal oxides, such as iron ore, by removing oxygen.\nIn the steelmaking process, coal is used as a reducing agent to extract iron from iron ore. The heat generated from coal combustion is used to power a melting furnace*, and the resulting carbon monoxide (CO) acts as a reducing agent, producing carbon dioxide in the process.\n*Melting furnace: Equipment used to melt materials like iron, glass, or rare earth metals at high temperatures.\nLG Chem’s DRM (Dry Reforming of Methane) technology, a form of CCU (Carbon Capture and Utilization), uses carbon dioxide and methane (CH₄) as feedstock to produce carbon monoxide (CO), a reducing agent, and hydrogen. These outputs can be used in steelmaking processes to reduce the reliance on coal.\nCarbon monoxide can also serve as a raw material for various chemical products such as plastics, while hydrogen can be used as an eco-friendly fuel. If commercialized through this demonstration project, the technology is expected to expand its range of applications significantly.\nAs leading players in the chemical and steel industries, LG Chem and POSCO Holdings aim to drastically reduce carbon emissions and secure key raw materials and fuels in a cost-efficient manner. This initiative is expected to serve as a game-changer in achieving South Korea’s carbon neutrality goals.\nIn 2023, LG Chem built a 1,000-ton DRM pilot plant at its Daesan site in South Chungcheong Province, where it is currently validating its proprietary process and catalyst technology. The CCU demonstration project will begin with the design phase in 2026, followed by facility construction at the Pohang steelworks in 2028, and demonstration operations through 2030.\nKi Soo Kim, Head of Future Technology Research Center and CTO of POSCO Holdings, stated, “The CCU Mega Project consortium led by POSCO Holdings and joined by LG Chem will mark a major milestone in achieving carbon reduction goals. We will focus our capabilities on developing technologies that reduce carbon generated during production and convert it into high-value materials, while maximizing synergy between the two companies.”\nJongku Lee, Executive Vice President and CTO of LG Chem, stated, “This collaboration between LG Chem and POSCO Holdings goes beyond a simple partnership. It marks a turning point where the steel and chemical industries come together to lead the era of carbon neutrality. LG Chem will not remain confined to existing industrial structures but will continue to take bold steps forward to lead the way in carbon-reducing and sustainable innovations across global industries.”\nMeanwhile, the CCU demonstration project connecting the chemical and steel industries will be led by POSCO Holdings. Five institutions、including POSCO, the Gyeongbuk Research Institute, the Gyeongbuk Carbon Neutrality Support Center, the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, and Hongik University, will participate in CO₂ capture, CCU infrastructure development, and reduction assessment. The CO₂ conversion technology demonstration will involve four additional institutions: RIST (Research Institute of Industrial Science & Technology), POSTECH, Seoul National University, and Hanyang University."

As the first U.S. manufacturing center for full electrodialysis systems, we’re creating local jobs, strengthening regional supply chains, and establishing domestic production capabilities for a high-demand electrochemical technology, reducing American dependence on foreign-made components.”  \n  \nCaptura’s proprietary electrodialysis technology—a process that uses ion-selective membranes and electrical current to separate ions in solution—significantly outperforms commercially available systems in both efficiency and cost. At the core of this advancement is Captura’s high-performance, PFAS-free bipolar membrane, which is made using polymer materials that are significantly less expensive than commercially available options. Captura has also developed an improved electrodialysis stack design that further enhances overall system performance.  \n  \n“Our electrodialysis technology was born in Caltech’s Pasadena laboratories, so it’s fitting that we’re now scaling its commercial production here,” said CX Xiang, Chief Technology Officer and co-founder of Captura. “This facility enables us to develop, optimize, customize and manufacture our best-in-class bipolar membranes and electrodialysis stacks in-house—a vertically integrated approach that positions Captura to deliver one of, if not the, highest-performance and lowest-cost electrodialysis solutions on the market.”\nElectrodialysis technology is instrumental for multiple industries including desalination, wastewater treatment, critical mineral extraction, and life sciences. Producing Captura’s advanced systems domestically can help dramatically reduce costs across these sectors and strengthen America’s position in the global technology supply chain.  \n  \nCaptura’s electrodialysis system also forms the basis of its DOC technology, which extracts CO₂ directly from seawater without chemical additives or waste products. This creates a measurable stream of CO₂ that can be permanently stored or utilized in a range of industrial applications, while allowing the ocean to naturally absorb more CO₂ from the atmosphere."

    "content": "Carbon Clean, a global leader in revolutionizing carbon capture solutions, and MODEC, a leading provider of offshore floating platforms, have signed a landmark agreement to jointly develop and scale Carbon Clean’s CycloneCC carbon capture technology for offshore applications. \nThe collaboration will accelerate progress toward the deployment of a fully commercialized CycloneCC solution on MODEC’s industry-leading FPSO designs. Under the agreement, a pilot plant is targeted for installation on an FPSO in 2026. This will be followed by the first commercial-scale deployment, targeting capture of up to 100,000 tons of CO2 per year, enabling partial decarbonization. A further scale-up will integrate CycloneCC into the FPSO design to achieve full decarbonization, with the capacity to capture approximately 300,000 tons of CO2 per year. \nTogether, MODEC and Carbon Clean aim to fast-track the delivery of industry-leading carbon capture technology capable of capturing up to 1,000 tons of CO₂ per day onboard FPSOs, providing the maritime industry with a clear, scalable, and competitive pathway to full decarbonization. \nThis partnership builds on the growing commercial momentum between the two companies, following the February 2025 announcement of a Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) contract between Carbon Clean and SAMSUNG E&A. That project will result in the first-ever installation of a CycloneCC carbon capture module on a MODEC FPSO, marking a significant milestone in offshore decarbonization. \nCycloneCC is uniquely suited to the offshore maritime environment. Its compact footprint is up to 50% smaller than traditional solutions, with key equipment sizes reduced by a factor of ten. The C1 series, the newest in the CycloneCC lineup, delivers a 70% height reduction compared to column-based technologies. Its Rotating Packed Bed (RPB) design enhances performance under vessel motion – an essential advantage for FPSO operations. \n**Aniruddha Sharma, Chair and CEO of Carbon Clean, said:** “MODEC is setting the pace for the next generation of FPSO development, and we’re proud to support their leadership with our cutting-edge carbon capture technology. This agreement is a major step toward commercializing onboard carbon capture for FPSOs and sets a precedent for the broader maritime industry. As the International Maritime Organisation’s emissions regulations develop in support of maritime decarbonization, CycloneCC offers a scalable and viable solution to help vessels meet these targets and achieve full emissions reductions before the end of this decade.” \n**Koichi Matsumiya, Chief Technical Officer, MODEC, said:** “Based upon the early success of the partnership that we are currently enjoying with Carbon Clean on the Pilot Plant Project, we decided to take this daring step to commit early to accelerating this work. As a technology integrator and offshore solutions provider, we must remain committed to our core values and continue to seek realization of our vision to explore ways to contribute to society humbly and diligently”. \nThis collaboration plays a key role in MODEC’s decarbonization roadmap, as outlined in its Vision 2034 strategy, which aims to significantly reduce CO₂ emissions across its FPSO fleet. It also positions both companies at the forefront of offshore decarbonization and lays the groundwork for commercial-scale adoption of CycloneCC across the global FPSO market."

    "content": "Iluka Resources has awarded JordProxa the contract to supply a custom-engineered CO₂ capture plant for its flagship Eneabba rare earths refinery in Western Australia — a first-of-its-kind facility in Australia and among only a few rare earths refineries outside China.\nThis award further strengthens the collaboration between Iluka and JordProxa, building on JordProxa’s earlier contract for ten modular evaporation plants at Eneabba.\nThe CO₂ capture plant is designed to recover carbon dioxide from boiler off-gas using an aqua ammonia solution, producing a controlled ammonium carbonate/bicarbonate mixture at the desired pH. This process is critical not only for meeting emission standards for ammonia but also for achieving precise CO₂ recovery, which plays a key role in downstream process chemistry.\nJordProxa’s solution includes three gas processing columns: one for gas conditioning and primary cooling/polishing, and two for CO₂ absorption and final gas polishing. The system has been carefully designed to minimize energy usage and reduce operating costs without compromising on recovery efficiency or environmental performance.\nWhile the large columns are supplied loose for on-site assembly, pumps, heat exchangers, and ancillary systems are delivered in modular skids — allowing for simplified installation, reduced on-site risks, and improved quality through controlled off-site fabrication.\nThis project highlights JordProxa’s commitment to sustainable innovation and delivering integrated process solutions across critical minerals projects."

    "content": "Jay LeJeune likes a challenge. That’s why he signed up to be part of the Bayou Bend CCS LLC (Bayou Bend) team.\nBayou Bend, a joint venture between Chevron, Equinor and TotalEnergies SE, is a carbon dioxide (CO2) transportation and storage project in Southeast Texas. It aims to help industries in the region make strides toward their lower carbon goals.\nThe team has already reached key milestones including drilling the project’s onshore and offshore stratigraphic wells. These wells supplied key data about the subsurface area—data that’s helpful in determining whether the conditions are right for storing CO2. The intent is for Bayou Bend to be a hub of CO2 storage for industries in the area.\n“It’s exciting to use our expertise in areas where we have a longstanding history of helping industries and customers that use our products. We’re leveraging proven methods that have the potential to make a positive impact at scale,” said LeJeune, Chevron’s commercial advisor for the Bayou Bend project. “Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) is a tool in the toolkit to support U.S. energy competitiveness.”\n**Bringing Chevron Expertise to Carbon Storage**  \nBayou Bend is an approximately 140,000-acre onshore and offshore project positioned along the U.S. Gulf Coast and operated by Chevron. LeJeune noted that experience matters when you’re developing a project like this.\n“I was drawn to this project because Chevron knows wells and pipelines,” LeJeune said. “It’s an exciting time to see our more than 140 years of expertise and technology supporting a region that supplies so many critical products and jobs.”\nWith its mix of industrial activity, the right geology, infrastructure and workforce, Southeast Texas is a prime location for a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project. The growing CCS industry could help drive economic growth, attract investment and create jobs. It could also allow the region to be a leader in both energy and environmental innovation.\n**What’s Next for Bayou Bend**  \nIn 2024, Bayou Bend reached another milestone: The project submitted a permit application for CO2 injection. The approval process usually takes the regulatory agency about two years. An approved permit means that the project satisfies government requirements designed to protect public health and underground sources of drinking water.\nThere is still more work to do before injecting CO2 into the project’s storage sites. The team must complete the design, engineering and building of facilities and supporting infrastructure. Wells for storage will need to be drilled, and the monitoring program must be implemented.\n“No one country, no one company, no one industry acting alone can meet the world’s energy and climate ambitions,” said Chris Powers, Chevron’s vice president of CCUS & Emerging. “Bayou Bend seeks to play a key role in supporting those goals. Our project is well-positioned to support multiple industries in their ambitions to lower carbon intensity and continue the positive economic impact of these industries along the U.S. Gulf Coast.”"
