Time is running out for Americans to get a federally funded discount on energy upgrades that can lower their utility bills and make their homes healthier and more comfortable.
The GOPphases out tax credits that help households afford heat pumps and other energy-saving electric appliances. The credits were supposed to last about a decade; now they sunset Dec. 31
To meet this use-it-or-lose-it moment, electrification advocacy nonprofit Rewiring America last week launched the
“CEO“
The tax credits enable households to save thousands of dollars on their federal taxes when they invest in energy-slashing home upgrades, including electrical panel retrofits, weatherization improvements, and installations of solar panels, heat pump heater/​air conditioners, home batteries, and heat-pump water heaters.
Such measures are especially salient as households grapple with inflation, tariffs, and rapidly rising electricity costs. President Donald Trump promised to lower power bills, but experts expect his administration’s anti-renewables agenda will keep them climbing.
Efficiency upgrades also help put a dent in planet-warming pollution.
With the long lead time often needed to get quotes and book contractors, households realistically need to decide if they’re going to pursue clean energy projects in the next several weeks to get the federal discounts, Matusiak said.
Accordingly, the campaign, which runs until the end of October, is a full-court press of resources and tailored support. Rewiring America is also coordinating with elected officials, manufacturers, utilities, and grassroots groups on the effort. Among those partners is the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of 24

My family started this journey 3 years ago. As it turns out, just in time. Today our residential power generation and storage system powers our home and car, and significantly helps insulate us from the continuing Trump Tax and Inflation push. As the US power grids falter and deteriorate, the grid outages and climate disasters accelerate. Our power system, along with the efficiency improvements we've implemented, stand a good chance of powering us through. The cost of waiting is growing, but so are the many developing methods to help people move in a sustainable direction. It's great to read about positive responses to our current ""government by spastic attack"" unfolding disasterous federal meltdown.

Canary Media’s Electrified Life column shares real-world tales, tips, and insights to demystify what individuals can do to shift their homes and lives to clean electric power.
Kathy Palmer was intrigued when her neighbor, an environmental lawyer she’d met while volunteering on a Minneapolis climate committee, sang the praises of the new heat pump he had installed in his home.
Now, Palmer is enjoying the warmth of her own heat pump.

## At home with a heat pump
Since August, Palmer’s heat-pump system has delivered comfort, efficiency, greater peace of mind, and lower bills.
Because heat pumps are two-in-one heaters and air conditioners, she has abundant cooling for the first time, allowing her to ditch the clunky and less-efficient window AC
And since heat-pump systems are modular, she now has different heating zones that can be independently controlled. Palmer is a widow and empty-nester, so there’s no need to always heat the whole house. The system, which provides heat to some rooms through vents and others via wall-mounted units, allows her to heat just the rooms she’s using, reducing her energy consumption. “
Another detail that factored into her decision to get a heat pump: Having one will boost her home’s resale value. According to a Nature10000252000030000

Palmer’s heat pump also reduces her family’s exposure to toxic pollutants emitted by burning gas. She noted that access to clean air is particularly important for her daughter who has asthma.
What’s more, Palmer is thrilled to be taking action to help fight climate change, the effects of which she’s already feeling. She and her family spend a lot of time outside in northern Minnesota’s shimmering 20232024““
In Minnesota, switching to a cold-climate heat pump can make a huge difference in annual household emissions, cutting them by an estimated

Looking ahead, Palmer is considering going to an all-electric heat system. The lowest-cost option in that scenario would likely entail taking out the boiler and radiators, installing ducts, upgrading the electrical panel, adding more heat-pump equipment, and using electric-resistance heat strips for extra heat on demand — at a potential cost of $3500040000150007100

Airplanes. Power plants. Cars and trucks. Their images might be the first to spring to mind when thinking about the challenge posed by the energy transition.
But what about plain old buildings?
From their structural bones to the energy they constantly consume, buildings account for a staggering 123CO2 in 2022
Most of these emissions come from their operations — the fuel burned on-site for heating and cooking and off-site to produce their electricity. But 26CO2 annually, or 7
A February report lays out a blueprint for tackling each of these sources of CO2 and 2050
The report identifies several key levers that must all be pulled in order to deal with the climate problems from buildings: energy efficiency, electrification, flexible power use, and design that minimizes materials and uses cleaner ones. Each is showing varying degrees of progress around the world.
““
!cartoon buildings with solar panels, heat pumps, smart energy systems, other electric equipment, powered by renewable energy (Energy Transitions Commission)
## How to make buildings more energy efficient
Building developers and owners can pursue a variety of strategies to make their buildings less energy-intensive and cheaper to operate without sacrificing the comfort of their residents, according to the report.
They can seal air leaks; insulate attics, walls, and floors; and install double- or triple-pane windows to make buildings snug like beer cozies. Weatherization strategies that take a medium level of effort would cut 103060
!chart showing passive techniques, including air sealing and wall insulation, their energy savings, and rates of return. (Energy Transitions Commission)
For retrofits, online tools and in-person energy audits can help owners decide which changes make the biggest difference for the climate, their comfort, and their energy bills.
Other simple techniques can combat growing demand for cooling, which globally is set to more than double by 20502540
Efficiency measures “
But because the payoffs can be slow to materialize, governments should provide targeted financing to lower-income households that might not otherwise be able to afford these upgrades, she added.
There’s also the challenge of convincing landlords to invest in efficiency measures even though tenants often pay for utility bills themselves. To ensure broad uptake, the authors recommend policymakers implement building performance standards, an approach adopted by U.S. cities like New York and St. Louis to penalize building owners who fail to meet certain emissions or energy-use benchmarks.
For new builds, energy codes and other regulated standards can set a performance floor. They differ widely worldwide, but the Passive House approach is “5070
What’s more, new buildings that use 20“15
Connecting buildings via underground thermal energy networks in which they share heat can also unlock big efficiency gains — and do it faster and at bigger scales than individual action might. The report notes that they “
## To decarbonize buildings, electrify everything
Buildings will need to be fully electrified to become climate friendly. That means swapping fossil-fuel–fired equipment for über-efficient heat pumps (including the geothermal kind), heat-pump water heaters, heat-pump clothes dryers, and induction stoves.
Heat pumps are essential to decarbonize heating, which is the biggest source of operational emissions and currently only 15two to three times as efficient as gas equipment, and they lower emissions even when powered by grids not yet 100.
!chart of building energy use and fossil fuel use showing heating takes the biggest share of both Heating accounts for 45% of building energy use. Eighty percent of on-site fossil fuel use in buildings goes to heating. (Energy Transitions Commission)
Heat pumps can come at a premium, though the authors expect prices to fall as sales grow and installers gain experience. In countries with mature markets, heat pumps can even be cheaper than gas heating systems, according to the report: Take Denmark, Japan, Poland, and Sweden.
!ALT TEXT: chart of heat pump and gas boiler costs, based on the cheapest main model, in different countries (Energy Transitions Commission)
For most homes in the U.S. and many in Europe, per the report, heat pumps are cheaper to run than gas equipment and have lower total lifetime costs. Heat pumps make even more economic sense when consumers are considering installing an AC
These appliances also keep getting better. Manufacturers learn how to improve technologies with experience, as they have done with solar panels and wind turbines. The result is that heat pumps are becoming more efficient; getting smaller; and reaching higher temperatures as they transition to natural refrigerants (which also have lower global warming potentials), the authors write.
But policymakers need to address energy costs to encourage widespread electrification, according to the report. Countries with high electricity prices relative to those of gas
Fixes include shifting environmental levies that are currently disproportionately piled onto electricity bills to gas costs, offering lower electricity rates for customers with electric heating, and putting a price on carbon, the report says. Banning gas equipment would be the most direct move, but “
## Make demand for grid power flexible
Buildings will need more power when they’re all-electric, potentially straining grids. Unchecked, global electricity demand for buildings by 20502545
That’s still massive. So, to decarbonize buildings without breaking the grid, we’ll need to make them flexible in their electricity demand, the authors note. By using power when it’s cheap, clean, and abundant, these edifices will also be more affordable than they’d be otherwise.
Low-cost smart thermostats and sensors can reduce demand by 1530tens of thousands of dollars in annual savings by dialing down energy use when grid demand is highest.
The report recommends that all buildings aim to have the ability to shift when they actively heat or cool by two to four hours without compromising comfort. That’s doable with existing solutions that provide thermal inertia, including insulation and tank water heaters that can store hot water for when it’s needed.
Utilities and regulators can spur more flexible demand by implementing electricity rates or
““
## How to clean up embodied carbon
Building floor area globally is expected to grow by over 50205075CO2 between now and midcentury.
But that amount could be reduced to about 30CO2 by maximizing the utility of buildings that already exist, decarbonizing building materials, and designing new ones differently.
Using existing structures is “
!chart of opportunities to reduce embodied emissions, with building nothing having the biggest potential (Energy Transitions Commission)
Producing materials drives up-front emissions, and the biggest contributors are cement, concrete, and steel, the report notes: They account for 95
Low- and zero-carbon cement, concrete, and steel can be made using electricity, alternative fuels, exotic chemistries (including ones inspired by corals), and carbon capture with storage. But developers need incentives to buy these clean materials, which aren’t yet widely available or competitive on cost alone.
A complementary approach is to design buildings with less of the emitting stuff. For the same floor space, a mid-rise structure uses less material than a high-rise, which needs a larger foundation and bigger columns. A boxy building is more efficient than an irregular one.
Developers can moreover supplement construction with alternative, lower-carbon materials, per the report. These include recycled materials, sustainably sourced timber, bamboo, rammed earth, and “

Embodied carbon has been particularly challenging to curb because it’s largely invisible. In 2021
Developers weren’t required to stay below any carbon-intensity threshold; they just had to report expected emissions, said Stephen Hill, associate director in the buildings sustainability team at firm Arup, a member of the Energy Transitions Commission.

Stephen Richardson, senior impact director at the nonprofit World Green Building Council, emphasized at the commission’s panel event that to decarbonize buildings, governments need to do two things at once. ““

The Trump administration appears poised to cancel billions of dollars of federal funding meant to help U.S. industries convert to cleaner alternatives to burning fossil fuels.
States can’t match the federal government’s spending power, but there are steps they can take to reduce industry’s emissions, support jobs and economic growth in places burdened by industrial pollution, and help prepare U.S. companies for global markets increasingly demanding lower-carbon commodities and products.
So says a March report from think tank RMI25
To be clear, “RMI“
But some common lessons can be drawn, she said. The first is not to try and recreate the federal government’s “$6 under the Inflation Reduction Act’s Industrial Demonstrations Program, which is now potentially on the Trump administration’s chopping block.
“
That’s too bad, because many industrial companies rely on ““like steel and cement, which have massive capital assets like blast furnaces and cement kilns that will need to be replaced or significantly retrofitted to cut emissions.
But other strategies represent lower-hanging fruit — in particular, replacing fossil-fueled boilers with industrial heat pumps and electric boilers, said Jeffrey Rissman, industry program director at the think tank Energy Innovation.
These technologies are well-suited to electrifying steam heating for food and beverage processing, chemicals production, pulp and paper mills, and 30
Heat pumps, especially, are far more efficient at converting energy into heat than fossil-fueled boilers, Rissman said. These technologies are already being deployed today and can save companies money compared to fossil-fueled systems in some applications.
“
## Finding the money to decarbonize industry
Putting some public money into the up-front costs of electrification could certainly help move things forward, Rissman said. And in some cases, states may still have access to federal dollars to make that happen.
Take the

That includes smaller-scale federal funding sources, he added. For example, the Department of Energy’s Industrial Training and Assessment Centers program provides grants of up to $300000”
A handful of states are looking at spending their own money to boost industrial decarbonization. One way to do that is to tap into state and regional programs that collect fees from polluting industries, such as California’s greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative encompassing 11Washington state’s cap-and-invest program, RMI
In California, lawmakers are considering the state’s greenhouse gas reduction fund as a source of money for 90

“ now in place in nine states, which require state agencies to purchase concrete, steel, and other industrial outputs that are made via lower-carbon processes and using lower-carbon inputs, can further incentivize industries to invest in decarbonization, Rissman said.
Those programs can also provide reporting and compliance structures that companies will need to meet demands for lower-carbon products from corporate buyers, he said. And U.S. firms that export to Europe will be looking to avoid the looming

States have regulatory ““replace fossil-fueled water heaters, boilers, and process heating with electric systems within the next decade, Cheng said.
Colorado has both carrots and sticks in place, Wil Mannes, senior program manager of industrial decarbonization initiatives for the Colorado Energy Office, said during January’s webinar. The state passed a climate law in 2021 that set emissions limits on industrial facilities, with 20302015“
“California, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, and New York are among the states that have launched these discussions to craft long-term plans for reducing customers’ reliance on fossil gas delivered through utility pipelines.
In Illinois, state regulators and other stakeholders are considering “
## A key to decarbonization? Ensuring long-term benefits for companies
Regulations and up-front financing are both important policy levers. But widespread industrial decarbonization won’t take off unless companies are confident that the investments they’re making will eventually pencil out financially.
““
Electric industrial heating faces a core challenge in the U.S. — the between fossil gas and electricity. Cheap domestic gas supplies have undercut the economics of industrial electrification over the past two decades, and while
Underneath these broad averages lie significant regional differences, however. Low spark gaps have
Narrowing the spark gap down to where it encourages industrial electrification relies on two important variables, Kwon said — “
One way to do that is to “
That’s why industrial electrification proponents are eager for states to create routes for industrial customers to access these cheap wholesale prices, rather than remaining on the retail utility rates that shield customers from these price swings. Access to bulk electricity price differentials is particularly essential for making the business case for thermal-energy storage technologies, which convert electricity to heat and store it for long durations.
In return, big industrial customers can act similarly to utility-scale batteries on the grid, Kwon said — storing excess power when prices are low and using it to reduce their grid demands when power is scarce. That’s already happening in Northern European countries “
Just how this concept can be applied depends on what kind of utility rates and energy market structures different states have, Rissman said. For decades, utilities have negotiated special rate structures with particularly large and power-hungry facilities, such as steel furnaces and aluminum smelters. And competitive energy markets like those in Texas, or across some Northeastern and Midwestern states, allow large customers to contract with retail energy providers in ways that let them access wholesale energy market prices, he said.
But these arrangements are largely kept private since they constitute a competitive advantage for the industries that are getting them, he noted. What’s more, rate programs still need to protect factories or facilities from being exposed to the enormous price spikes that can occur at times of power shortage or grid emergency — at least, for all but the handful of industrial players willing to take the risks involved. At the same time, wholesale pricing structures shouldn’t allow industrial customers to avoid paying their fair share of power grid investments or other costs that are bundled into retail rates.
In California, advocates have proposed regulations to allow industrial decarbonization projects to access low-cost renewable energy through some kind of exposure to or pass-through of the state’s wholesale energy market, Cheng said. Last year, state regulators ““

Abandoned mines across Ohio remain polluted. This site in North Lima, pictured above, is impacted by acid mine drainage. (
A new law in Ohio will fast-track energy projects in places that are hard to argue with: former coal mines and brownfields.
But how much the legislation benefits clean energy will depend on the final rules for its implementation, which the state is working out now.

The law aims to boost energy production to meet growing demand from data centers and increasing electrification, while applying competitive pressure to rein in power prices.
Targeting former coal mines and brownfields as priority investment areas furthers that goal while encouraging the productive use of land after mining, manufacturing, or other industrial activity ends. Buyers are often wary of acquiring these properties due to the risk of lingering pollution.
The new law could also help developers sidestep the bitter land-use battles that have bogged down other clean-energy projects in Ohio, particularly those looking to use farmland.
Priority areas might “MAREC

But two Ohio agencies still need to finalize rules before companies can start building energy projects in these underutilized spaces and benefiting from the new law.

Those timelines are shorter than the approximately five months HB15
## The debate over HB15
Advocates and industry groups generally applaud the new law but want tweaks to the Power Siting Board’s proposed rules.
A big concern is making sure the board will allow wind and solar developments on mine lands and brownfields throughout Ohio, regardless of which county they’re in. Roughly 88202152
However, the language and legislative history of HB15“technology-neutral,” said Rebecca Mellino, a climate and energy policy associate for The Nature Conservancy.

The Nature Conservancy has asked the Power Siting Board to add language making it crystal-clear that renewable-energy projects can be built on any land marked a priority investment area — even if a solar and wind ban otherwise exists in a county.
Industry groups are pushing for additional clarifications to make sure the Power Siting Board meets the permitting deadlines set by the new law, both for expedited and standard projects.
For example, Open Road Renewables, which builds large-scale solar and battery storage, said in HB15

The Department of Development hopes to finish draft standards and invite public comments on them soon, Waldvogel said.

A Michigan nuclear plant is looking to make history not once but twice over: First by restarting a reactor shuttered in 2022
Holtec International — the nuclear company best known for decommissioning shuttered plants and manufacturing the canisters that store spent fuel — bought the Palisades nuclear plant on the southeastern shore of Lake Michigan a month after utility giant Entergy took the financially troubled single-reactor facility offline.
Last year, the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office deal to give Holtec $15255800wants to plug the facility back into the grid by the end of this year.
Now Holtec plans to nearly double the electricity output from Palisades by building two of its own small modular reactors, or SMRs, at the site.
On Tuesday, top executives gathered at the facility in Covert Township, Michigan, to unveil blueprints for adding a pair of its proprietary SMR-300300 units internationally — as its partner in the debut U.S. project. Completing the reactor would be a first not just for the country but the company. While Holtec has disassembled reactors, it has yet to build one, much less its own design.

First, Holtec will need the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s approval of its reactor design.

In other words, those developers will design and license the technology and make money off the intellectual property, he said, but utilities and construction firms must provide the financing, time, and materials.

Holtec is betting its decades of manufacturing know-how, experience managing complex nuclear projects, and early engagement with federal regulators will secure approval fast enough to construct both its SMRs in the next five years — a breakneck speed by the standards of reactor construction.

This artist’s rendering shows how Prisma Photonics uses fiber-optic lines strung along transmission towers (highlighted in pink) to detect temperature, pressure, and electromagnetic disturbances in the nearby environment (the white circles). (Prisma Photonics)
Lots of costly and dangerous things can go wrong with high-voltage transmission lines.
Strong winds or equipment failures can cause individual lines on a tower to contact one another and short-circuit, or even break entirely. Lines can sag hazardously near trees or the ground, either due to overheating or being caked in ice. They can be damaged by wildfire smoke, windblown debris, or the simple wear and tear of time.
Sensors can help detect such threats. But it’s expensive and time-consuming to install, connect, and maintain those devices along power lines crossing remote plains, forests, and mountains.
It would be a lot cheaper and faster for utilities if they could simply use existing infrastructure to detect these issues instead of tacking on new sensors. That’s the route that

That opens up a huge market for Prisma Photonics, as long as it can prove its technology is accurate enough to replace purpose-built sensors for a growing number of tasks. The more jobs Prisma’s technology can do, the more money it could potentially save transmission grid operators, Inbar said.
Finding ways to do more things with less money and less time is important for transmission owners striving to solve multiple challenges at once. Climate change-driven heat waves and winter freezes are causing more grid emergencies, both by increasing demand for electricity for air conditioning and heating and by subjecting transmission networks to increased stress.

This is one of several methods to use fiber-optics as sensors to detect shifts in temperature, pressure, strain on the cables, and other signals, Inbar said. “
Connecting these nearly imperceptible variations to changes in the surrounding environment takes a ton of data, some complicated machine-learning algorithms to convert it into usable information, and a lot of real-world cross-checking, he said. One of Prisma’s first tasks was to eliminate the false positives — alerts of events that didn’t actually happen — that have stymied earlier efforts to use already-deployed fiber-optic cables to sense environmental conditions.

Continued progress for solar — and for any clean energy deployments — will depend heavily on the Trump administration.
President Donald Trump has already stalled clean energy and infrastructure projects nationwide by attempting to halt hundreds of billions of dollars in congressionally authorized funding — a move that experts say is illegal and has been struck down by federal courts. Some Republican members of Congress have also threatened to roll back clean energy tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act that are key to enduring growth in the renewables sector.

The political picture is even more grim for the U.S. wind sector, which has already seen years of declining installations and now faces relentless attacks from Trump.

Beyond the U.S., Powin has supplied batteries for pathbreaking projects in countries from Australia to Mexico. (Powin)
Southern California’s grid needed help in the fall of 2016
Big names like Tesla and AES2
This proved to be a launchpad for the firm, which rose to the upper echelons of the booming U.S. battery industry before crashing down to earth last month.
After that Orange County installation, Powin refocused on importing battery cells from China and integrating them into grid storage systems, fully packaged with inverters, controls, and safety systems. Powin went on to deliver battery enclosures for many pathbreaking projects: It supplied the landmark utility-endorsed battery fleet in Arizona, and a truly mammoth system in Australia, to name just a few of Powin’s self-reported KKR
And then in June, Powin filed for bankruptcy, alerting the state of Oregon of mass layoffs at its Tualatin campus, outside Portland. The news jolted the storage industry, since so many major grid storage plants run on Powin’s hardware and software. The bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing, but storage software specialist FlexGen has placed a bid to buy Powin’s assets at auction in early August, offering Powin customers a way to keep their batteries running.
Cleantech bankruptcies have flourished under the second Trump presidency, and the storage sector is uniquely exposed. The industry runs almost entirely on imported battery cells from China, making it vulnerable to rapidly shifting trade policies. The Biden administration raised tariffs on Chinese batteries, and President Donald Trump cranked the overall rate on Chinese imports as high as 145new bureaucratic regime to regulate the amount of China-derived equipment in those storage plants.
““
Nonetheless, Powin’s collapse stands out for the scale of the company’s reach — and raises serious questions. Is Trumpian chaos enough to unseat a leading battery supplier, even as the market for grid batteries continues to surge? Or did Powin’s leadership make choices that ultimately led to its early demise? And perhaps more important, what’s going to happen to those 113
## Major growth, then signs of trouble
Powin got to the big leagues by spotting technological trends before they hit the energy-storage mainstream.

Developer Convergent Energy and Power owned both systems, and its investigation concluded that a manufacturing flaw in that generation of Powin’s Centipede battery container let water leak in and start electrical fires. Those incidents prompted the Warwick Village Board to
It’s unclear what kind of financial impact the fallout from those fires had on Powin, but the firm subsequently found itself locked in a legal dispute with none other than its longtime supplier, CATL202444

Other sources in the grid storage industry noted that Powin’s quality had suffered in the scale-up, lowering customer interest in its products. The company had always had a smaller balance sheet than competitors like Tesla, Fluence, and Wärtsilä, all of which are publicly traded and worth billions.

Powin wouldn’t be the first cleantech company that failed after getting behind on its debt payments. Major rooftop solar provider Sunnova increasingly turned to corporate debt to raise cash as the market soured, then struggled to find cash for debt payments and fell into bankruptcy in June. Electric bus maker Proterra piled up corporate debt before its bankruptcy filing in 2023
## Action needed to keep the batteries running
Powin’s financial collapse triggered an existential question for all the storage plants out there running on its hardware and software.
“
Software needs updates, as anyone with an iPhone is repeatedly reminded, and the same goes for the systems that tell huge banks of batteries when to charge and discharge. Energy market rules change; hardware trips up. If Powin simply ceased to exist, it would jeopardize the reliability of all the critical power plants running on its control systems.
But those anxious battery owners may soon get some relief now that software startup FlexGen became a stalking horse bidder in June, proposing to buy “36

As for the business of buying battery cells and turning them into storage plants, Pegler is happy to leave that to the existing field of storage manufacturers. He plans to stick to software and services.
Powin has let go of much of its staff. The founders will lose their stakes, and the venture capitalists and private-equity investors won’t rake in a multiple on their few hundred million dollars invested. But a sale to FlexGen would protect Powin’s physical legacy: The gigawatt-hours of batteries installed across the world could keep on humming, as the energy storage market careens ever onward.

Clean-energy industry advocates attacked the guidance as an improper use of executive authority that will make it harder for the U.S. to meet growing electricity demand and will further drive up electricity bills. But industry analysts noted that the new rules, though restrictive, could have turned out even worse.

Shortly after the law passed in July, Trump ordered the Treasury Department to review the safe-harbor rules. The directive came after pressure from the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus members in the House of Representatives, who were upset that the law preserved tax credits for wind and solar projects at all. In that same executive order, Trump also told Treasury to develop rules governing “foreign entity of concern” restrictions; those rules, which are still in development, could be even more disruptive to the industry.

Thermal energy storage systems, which turn electricity into heat that can be tapped for hours or days at a time, could help decarbonize the production of everything from cement to beer.
But in the U.S., where the economics of replacing fossil fuels with electricity remain challenging, thermal-battery startup
Last week, the San Francisco Bay Area-based firm 100“

The project is something of a Faustian bargain. It will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 13000
Rondo’s argument for pursuing this application is twofold. For one, fossil fuels will be in use for decades to come, and so we might as well reduce emissions from the sector where we can. Second, thermal-storage startups need paying customers in order to scale up their technology, which could prove necessary to minimize pollution from a host of hard-to-decarbonize sectors.

Finding cost-effective projects in the U.S. has become even more important after the Trump administration canceled hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants for industrial decarbonization efforts across the country. The defunded projects included ones that planned to use Rondo heat batteries: International spirits maker Diageo wanted to install the tech at its
Those companies haven’t said if they plan to continue work on those projects absent federal funding, and O’Donnell declined to comment on their prospects. “
But industry experts have pointed out that building first-of-a-kind thermal batteries is challenging without government funding to absorb some of the risk. The recent rollbacks jeopardize the U.S.’s ability to develop a technology that could play a major role in cleaning up industrial heating, which is responsible for roughly

## Building a first-of-a-kind project

Rondo’s Kern County battery, meanwhile, is its first major installation, though it has several others in the works across Europe. It’s building similar heat batteries at a chemicals plant in Germany, a green industrial park in Denmark, and an undisclosed food-and-beverage processing facility in Spain or Portugal.
The market for Rondo’s tech is stronger in Europe, where companies pay much higher prices for fossil gas and face sizeable fees and taxes on their greenhouse gas emissions, O’Donnell said. In the U.S., by contrast, fossil gas is cheap, and only a handful of states impose costs on industrial carbon emissions.
California is one of those states. Under its
Still, even in more competitive markets like Europe and California, Rondo has additional work to do to hit its long-range cost goals. O’Donnell said the company is targeting $30

## Soaking up excess clean power with heat batteries
The holy grail for thermal storage — the thing that will make it broadly cost-competitive with fossil-fueled heating — is tapping into cheap, clean power.
That’s because the cost of electricity is ultimately what dictates whether a thermal battery makes financial sense. But unlike fossil fuels, electricity prices vary not just from week to week, but from hour to hour. That makes it tricky for would-be customers to evaluate whether to stick with a gas boiler or to make a bet on an electricity-powered system like Rondo’s.
Solar and wind, however, reliably generate power at a very low cost. In some parts of the U.S. and the world, the amount of renewable energy available exceeds electricity demand for hours at a time, driving wholesale power prices to zero or even negative.
Storing this excess carbon-free electricity as heat can significantly cut costs for owners of thermal storage systems, O’Donnell said. The challenge for providers of the tech is to get utilities, regulators, and energy-market operators to allow industrial customers to access those low or negative energy prices, O’Donnell said. Today, most industrial sites buy their electricity from utilities at retail rates that don’t pass through these wide wholesale fluctuations.
This is especially true in California, where thermal batteries are “
Solar power is close to overtaking fossil gas as the state’s predominant source of electricity. Much of it is generated at times when there isn’t enough demand for electricity to use it or enough battery capacity to save it for later, forcing the state’s grid operator to curtail increasing magnitudes of solar.
Thermal batteries could soak up that cheap renewable energy while helping industries decarbonize, Cheng said. But “
Holmes Western Oil Corp. is in an unusual position of owning enough land surrounding its facility to build its own 20 solar array without connecting to the grid. That “
But that’s a rare occurrence. Most industrial customers will need to source power from the grid — and opportunities for them to access electricity at wholesale prices are few and far between.
Doron Brenmiller, cofounder and chief business officer of Israel-based thermal energy storage provider Brenmiller Energy, said Europe is moving more quickly than the U.S. to support heat batteries, including a number of projects his company is building. He cited the European Commission’s upcoming
““specialty grid services like frequency regulation and demand response.
But getting the first large-scale projects up and running remains the most important next step for the industry, he said. Brenmiller expects its first industrial-scale project, a 322025302026

Manufacturers took a gamble in betting that the U.S. could reshore the battery production that China has cornered with dedicated industrial policy over the last decade or more.

Trump’s massive tariffs on China could in theory support domestic producers. But the president has changed his tariff plans from week to week, denying would-be manufacturers the stable business environment they like to see before committing billions of dollars to a yearslong endeavor. Blanket tariffs on China also inflate the cost of battery materials, which are almost entirely processed in that country, as well as the cost of battery manufacturing equipment, which also largely originates there.

To oversimplify, nuclear fusion — the source of the sun’s energy — involves converting hydrogen into plasma, which is then compressed and confined in a process that releases massive amounts of energy. Proponents say that fusion power plants could offer the best of nuclear energy — carbon-free electricity supplied around the clock — without the drawbacks of today’s nuclear fission plants, including the risk of catastrophic meltdowns and evergrowing stockpiles of radioactive waste.
Despite decades of research and billions of dollars in funding, fusion energy remains on the extremely early end of the technology-development curve. Yet a handful of recent engineering breakthroughs are giving fusion scientists and their deep-pocketed investors fresh hope that commercial fusion power could finally come to fruition.

The future of steel and ironmaking in the U.S. is poised to get cleaner — so long as the country can let go of the industry’s dirty past.
All new steelmaking and ironmaking capacity in the U.S. is slated to use technologies that sidestep the need to burn coal, according to
Steel and iron are among the most essential and widely used materials in the world. They’re also among the dirtiest to produce, responsible together for as much as 9 and a staggering amount of harmful local air pollution.
This is because the sector burns through an enormous amount of coal. The fossil fuel is traditionally used both in blast furnaces to purify iron ore and in basic oxygen furnaces to turn that purified iron into primary steel.
In the U.S., 12
About 70
In theory, steelmakers can run this electric equipment on clean power and pair it with a coal-free iron production process called direct reduction to create carbon-free primary steel. All of the new ironmaking capacity planned in the U.S. will use direct reduction, the report says, likely including Hyundai’s $6 to make what it describes as “
For now, U.S. facilities that use direct reduction will mainly rely on natural gas to purify the ore. Doing so can halve carbon emissions compared with using a coal-based blast furnace. The holy grail from a decarbonization standpoint is to eventually use carbon-free hydrogen in place of gas in the reduction process.
However, despite plans for cleaner facilities, steelmakers don’t intend to retire their dirtiest assets. Several of the dozen coal-fired blast furnaces still operating are slated to undergo costly relinings before 2030

Cheese. Beer. Clothes. Paper. Manufacturers across the country rely on combustion boilers to produce the heat required for making a range of products. But by burning coal, oil, gas, and other fuels to do so, that equipment spews health-harming and planet-warming pollution into the skies.

Like other fossil-fuel-burning machines, such as home appliances and cars, industrial combustion boilers release nitrogen oxides, fine particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide into the air. These toxic byproducts can harm children and adults in severe ways, such as asthma attacks, preterm births, heart attacks, strokes, and an impaired ability to think.
To quantify the benefits of switching to industrial heat pumps, the authors created an inventory of the industrial boilers across the U.S. based on publicly available data. They found that about 33500200
The team then estimated how much pollution would be avoided by gradually swapping these boilers out for electric heat pumps over the next 15332040001334
States in which more people live close to industrial pollution sources would experience the greatest boost to public health and productivity, according to the team’s analysis. The three with the biggest estimated health benefits are Florida, which would save $107826825
The transition would also reduce carbon emissions by 162050351
The findings come as the Trump administration aggressively rolls back emissions regulations, and support for industrial decarbonization projects, having cancelled $37 in May.
To push industries to switch to heat pumps, the report recommends state and local policymakers offer manufacturers incentives to electrify their heating, launch education campaigns aimed at communities and companies, and require the adoption of nonpolluting equipment. California has taken the lead; its South Coast Air Quality Management District passed a first-in-the-nation measure last year to gradually phase out combustion boilers and process heaters starting in 2026

# Oatly wants to kick its gas habit. Will other food and beverage firms follow?
Factories that make processed foods need lots of heat — and most burn gas to supply it. Companies like Oatly are grappling with how to decarbonize instead.

Many of these steps require heat — lots of it. Steam is used to treat the oats and to create hot water for cleaning equipment, for example. Pipes carrying this heat stretched above and around us, connecting like veins to the factory’s beating heart: the boiler room, where giant cylindrical tanks burn large volumes of natural gas every day.
Oatly, which has baked sustainability into its brand identity, recognizes that relying on fossil fuels for heating is a problem for the planet and is at odds with the company’s climate goals. At the Millville facility, Oatly has taken steps to reduce its gas use, including by recycling the plant’s waste heat.

Ditching gas entirely is a far greater challenge.
Oatly is considering installing industrial heat pumps and other electrified technology to replace its gas-fired boilers and reduce carbon emissions. But that promises to be an expensive endeavor, and the gas system in Millville is practically new, with many years of useful life left. In an industry that’s virtually always used fossil fuels to make heat, the company would be charting a new course in its effort to decarbonize.
It’s a dilemma facing food and beverage manufacturers across the country. Giant conglomerates and artisanal shops alike are feeling the pressure from consumers, shareholders, and regulators to minimize their environmental footprint — from how they source ingredients to how they operate the bakeries, breweries, and factories that make our supermarket staples.
But they are also contending with the logistics and cost of overhauling their operations. As firms like Oatly take the first steps, their real-world experiences could help ease the qualms of more-reluctant manufacturers.

Processes like mustard-making and cheese pasteurization require relatively low temperatures. That heat could potentially be provided using existing low-carbon solutions like electric boilers and industrial heat pumps, which transfer hot and cold air using a refrigerant. In 202180200392

Still, if it was easy to do, more facilities would’ve installed electric systems by now. The reality is that natural gas is cheap and abundant in the U.S., which makes it much harder to justify the expense of switching to electricity, especially for giant factories. And given that U.S. manufacturers have used fossil-fuel boilers for over a century to produce steam, many companies prefer to stick with technologies they already have and that are well understood — especially for things that people consume.

Before following Gavris along the catwalks and corridors of Oatly’s New Jersey factory, I sat down with Chris Edmonds at the front of the building. Edmonds is Oatly’s senior sustainability program manager for North America, and one of his main priorities is designing a decarbonization plan for the company’s facilities in Millville and Ogden, Utah.

Seated in the office, Edmonds outlined Oatly’s key strategies for decarbonizing heat in its U.S. facilities, beyond more immediate steps like boosting efficiency and recycling waste heat. Mostly, it has to do with ditching steam.
““
That history, coupled with low natural gas prices, has made steam the default setting for many facilities. But not every industrial process requires the high temperatures and pressures that steam-driven systems deliver. Often, facilities that need steam for specific purposes — like sterilizing infant formula or treating almonds to kill bacteria — will also use steam for more routine operations, such as washing food and cleaning.
Gas-fired boilers supply heat for Oatly’s New Jersey facility. (Matt Peters for Canary Media)
Until recently, manufacturers didn’t see this as much of a problem. But as companies look to decarbonize, using energy-intensive steam complicates those efforts. Across the industry, one approach that’s gaining traction is to “100212
Oatly is looking for de-steaming opportunities in Millville because its process already uses temperatures around that level, Edmonds said. Making the change would require redesigning the factory’s systems, but it may be worth the effort. If facilities can use hot water, they could operate more efficiently and cost-effectively. And it’d make it easier for plants to adopt currently available solutions such as electric boilers and industrial heat pumps.
Edmonds stood up, grabbed a dry-erase marker, then sketched out the complex calculations his team is considering for a possible heat-pump installation in New Jersey.

As it happens, Oatly already uses electric heat pumps at its flagship facility in Landskrona, Sweden, and a factory in the Netherlands. The machines boost the heating potential of hot water used throughout the plants, reducing the use of fossil boilers. The company also is in the process of replacing an aging boiler in Landskrona with a hybrid model that can burn gas or biomass pellets. Still, it’s hard to copy and paste those projects onto other facilities. In Europe, regional climate policies alongside rising gas prices — driven by Russia’s war in Ukraine — make for different market dynamics than in the United States.
Then there’s the fact that, save for the Landskrona plant, Oatly’s other facilities are relatively new. “
The same is true for many of its manufacturing partners. Next door to Oatly’s Millville factory is a larger facility run by 2022
As Oatly weighs what to do with its gleaming new boilers, other food and beverage companies are figuring out how to revamp much older factories. Kraft Heinz, headquartered in both Chicago and Pittsburgh, is one of those manufacturers.

““
Like Oatly, the company is scrutinizing how it uses heat in the first place. Kraft Heinz has started testing different ingredients to see if it can cook various products at lower temperatures while maintaining their classic tastes. Adopting less heat-intensive processes will be key as the manufacturer looks to ease off its gas boilers and shift to using electricity at its massive factories, which make everything from cream cheese, candy, and ground coffee to hot dogs and frozen tater-tots.

Eventually, the manufacturer aims to replicate its efforts across not just its remaining factories in North America but also within the dozens of manufacturing sites it partners with outside the region. “
Kraft Heinz and many other companies can’t solve all of their energy problems through de-steaming alone. But novel technologies are becoming available that could clean up the trickier, higher-temperature processes inside of food and beverage plants.
To learn more about one potential solution, I sat down with Addison Stark, CEO
The Colorado-based startup is making a heat-pump boiler that’s designed to slot in where a gas boiler would go in a factory’s steam-distribution system. The technology can draw heat from ambient air or water to make steam at the temperatures and pressures needed for industrial applications. It can also simultaneously deliver cooling or refrigeration.

““
If low-carbon solutions like these are going to scale up and fully commercialize, U.S. manufacturers will need to receive more policy support and government investment to defray the costs and risks of moving to a new kind of heating system, experts say.
That could include enacting federal tax credits that reward companies for investing in or producing non-polluting heat sources, similar to existing tax credits for clean electricity and clean hydrogen. Reforming electricity markets would enable thermal batteries such as Rondo’s to earn money for the role they play in balancing the electricity grid. Expanding federal programs, like the DOE

It’s unlikely that any of these measures will be enacted under the second Trump administration, which spent its first week attempting to unravel many Biden-era climate and clean energy policies. But advocates see investing in U.S. food and beverage facilities as part of the country’s broader goals of making American manufacturing more competitive in the global economy. Hart, the ACEEE372023

Back in New Jersey, at the end of my visit to the Oatly factory, Gavris led me from the cozy warmth of the production floor into the gray, damp outdoors.
We walked around the building to a loading dock, where Oatly pipes the residue left over from its process into a giant tank. A local company hauls the porridge-like sludge away for disposal, turning it into animal feed or pouring it into an anaerobic biodigester to make biogas to power buildings. Across the giant parking lot, we could see the beige exterior of the neighboring facility, where oat milk is made and packed into shelf-stable containers. A semitruck rumbled by us, ready to collect more gray and blue boxes of oat milk.

Building a new natural gas pipeline from Pennsylvania to New York would not make electricity in New England more affordable or reliable, experts say, despite the Trump administration’s push to revive a project that stalled out years ago.
Environmental advocates object to the construction of more gas infrastructure at a time when much of New England is trying to wean itself off fossil fuels, but there are economic concerns as well. Industry insiders say the proposed Constitution pipeline would do little to get more gas to New England power plants and could raise costs for both generators and consumers.
““
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin breathed new life into that narrative in a Boston Globe op-ed 125
It’s the latest in the EPA“end the $7 program that funds solar projects for low-income households, eliminate the Energy Star label for energy-efficient appliances, and strip itself of authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.
The Constitution pipeline is not a new project. Federal regulators initially approved it in 201420162020
Then, in May, the Trump administration lifted its stop-work order on a major offshore wind project under construction off Long Island’s coast, claiming the move was
In his Boston Globe piece, Zeldin traces New England’s soaring electricity prices — the highest of any region in the continental U.S. — back to an inadequate supply of natural gas to the area’s power plants. The Constitution pipeline would transport more gas into New York, where it could be exported to its neighbors to the East. More gas would mean more reliable power generation and lower electricity prices, Zeldin contends.
It has the ring of a plausible argument. New England’s power producers are heavily dependent on natural gas — 552024ISO
“
Piping more gas up from Pennsylvania’s ample supplies could seem like an economically sensible way to bolster the grid in light of these facts. The reality is far more complicated, however, say advocates and experts.
The major problem is that the pipeline wouldn’t actually bring much, if any, new gas into New England, Dolan said. The Constitution pipeline would terminate in Schoharie County, New York, where it would connect to pipes that already carry gas into New England. That existing infrastructure is the true bottleneck, he said.
The pipes into and around New England are “
““
Furthermore, multiple New England states are enacting plans to transition away from natural gas for home heating and appliances. In late 202320502025
Even if new pipelines increased New England’s gas supply, that influx of fuel would be unlikely to consistently lower prices in the long term, experts said. Despite the appealing logic that more supply leads to lower costs, natural gas prices are inherently volatile and susceptible to influence by global events. In 20222020645220430
““
A better solution to both price and reliability worries, said advocates, would be to build a system that simply requires less gas.
That would mean relying on a diverse portfolio of options that includes solar, offshore wind, battery storage, energy efficiency, and demand-response programs. Such resources could be coordinated to create virtual power plants — a collection of geographically distributed resources that can work together to supply power to the grid and reduce demand. Not only do these networks emit less greenhouse gases than fossil-fueled plants, but their components can be built more quickly and cheaply, McDiarmid said.
This approach already had a chance to prove itself this summer, when solar and storage worked together to lower peak demand during a heat wave that saw temperatures hit 100

The Trump regime keeps issuing stop work orders on offshore wind projects that are nearly complete and would relieve our need for more gas. It is criminal to stop these projects and then force fossil fuel on us.. They are literally consigning the human race to doom.

Lets have the natural gas supply as much as the pipeline can handle and do the rest with coal. People we got you covered. You will have reliable 24/7/365 electricity. The solar and wind can put into the batteries what little it can, and a few cars can be recharged at night with that battery stored power.

Responding to questions from Chief Justice Sharon Kennedy, Funk said each permitting case is considered individually. He also said public comments weren’t used as evidence by the board and didn’t determine the outcome.
On rebuttal, Settineri stressed that, in light of the rest of the board’s decision on Kingwood Solar, there is no evidence backing up the claim that the vigor and rationale of local governments’ opposition meant that the project would not serve the public interest. “
The board appeared to accept local objections at face value, said Chris Tavenor, general counsel at the Ohio Environmental Council, which is not a party to this case. “
““
## A looming decision
The Ohio Supreme Court will debate the case and is expected to come out with a decision in the coming months.
A decision against Kingwood Solar would establish a legal precedent that makes it much harder for companies to overcome local pushback, which has often been fueled by misinformation. An adverse ruling for the solar developer also would continue the uncertain regulatory standards and framework from the past several years.
Layne Ashton, a senior project development advisor focused on utility-scale solar at Engie North America, said his company would be very cautious about moving ahead with new facilities in Ohio.

There were boat rides to see an offshore wind farm — America’s largest — being constructed. An exhibit space greeted attendees with German beer, Danish cuisine, undersea robots, and free novelty socks stamped with wind turbines. But even a black-tie gala held after hours couldn’t lift the dark cloud hanging over this group of U.S. offshore wind professionals.
Two weeks ago, I attended one of the largest offshore wind conferences in America, a surreal experience given that the industry has become a political punching bag for President Donald Trump since he and the Republican Party resumed control of Washington in January. Two of the most popular sessions at the conference, which was organized by the industry group Oceantic Network, were about how to navigate and even appeal to GOP
It seemed prescient, though I was told it was coincidental, that the event was located in Virginia. It’s the sole Republican-led state actively building an offshore wind project — Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind — and that project seems to be one of few not facing political and legal challenges. At night from my hotel room, I could see the wind farm’s blinking lights on the horizon.
In one session, a spokesperson for the project said that it was 55“2026

Szoka said that when he talks to fellow Republicans about offshore wind, he stresses how the energy source eases load growth issues, especially amid a boom in artificial intelligence and data centers. He also emphasizes how offshore wind can be built much faster than other forms of energy, like nuclear.
And he offered another piece of advice: to embrace Republican rhetoric. Szoka gestured to bumper stickers his group had made and passed out to audience members depicting a wind turbine rising from the sea, a U.S. flag in the sky, and the words “AMERICANENERGYDOMINANCE

""In the United Kingdom, the country’s largest single emitter is a wood-fired power station that, as of 2022, released more than 12 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per day
This looks like a typo, it should be 12 MMT of CO2 per year from the Drax plant in the UK. 12 MMT per day would equal 4,380 MMT of CO2 per year, which is 11x larger than the total territorial GHG emissions for the entire UK in 2023.

You can use wood waste in more environmentally friendly ways - pyrolysis instead of combustion infrastructure is the answer. They should check out AirBurners, creates biochar and controls for PM.

So, it is a better idea to just let these trees, cut to protect utility wires, to just rot away somewhere still producing CO2 (and methane, and heat)? Don't waste the embodied energy of these trees, convert it to productive electricity instead. You get the CO2 no matter which method you use.

The Trump administration has extended its order to keep a Michigan coal-fired power plant running until November, well past its planned closure in the spring. It’s the latest move in a push to force dirty, expensive power plants to keep operating, which experts warn could saddle Americans with billions of dollars in unnecessary electricity costs.
Just days before the J.H. Campbell plant was set to shutter in May, the administration ordered it to stay open for 90 — an unprecedented federal intervention in state-regulated utility operations. That order has already cost Midwest utility customers millions, and Michigan’s top utility regulator estimates that keeping the aging plant open longer could burden consumers with more than $100
The Department of Energy’s Wednesday between $36 per year by the end of President Donald Trump’s term, per an August report from consultancy Grid Strategies.

Lawmakers, advocates, and industry experts are increasingly concerned that the Trump administration intends to apply its Section 202
The document was written to comply with an April taking unilateral authority over power-plant closures, circumventing decades-old structures that utilities, state and federal regulators, and regional grid operators follow to determine when power plants can close or when they must stay open.
Earlier this month, clean-energy trade groups and nine Democrat-led states filed rehearing requests with the DOE asking it to redo the July grid-reliability report. They argue the study uses cherry-picked data and flawed assumptions to declare that the U.S. faces a hundredfold increase in grid blackout risks absent federal intervention in power plant operations.
Running aging power plants is expensive for utility customers, both in terms of direct costs on energy bills and the indirect costs of crowding out new, cheaper renewables. Utilities and independent energy developers will build less solar, batteries, and wind power if those plants stay online.

Like other building performance standards across the country, Evanston’s policy will set limits on emissions or energy efficiency without mandating how
Nieuwsma describes Evanston’s law as ““
Evanston’s policy is unusual in baking in a high level of formal input from property owners. Three out of six seats on the technical committee will be nominated directly by local building owners associations,
The setup is designed to address property owners’ cost concerns and could help Evanston avoid industry pushback that has stymied similar laws in places like Colorado, which currently faces
Building performance standards are still relatively novel. The first one in the U.S. was introduced in 201820191130
Last year, the Biden administration doled out hundreds of millions of federal dollars under the Inflation Reduction Act to cities and states pursuing building performance standards. Evanston was one of them and received a $104
But since Inauguration Day, the Trump administration has attempted to freeze and claw back climate funding to nonprofits and local governments. Pratt said the federal government has not told the city that it will withdraw its grant, but Evanston has also not received word on whether the funding will be finalized.
The city had intended to use the grant to hire additional staff and support energy audits for resource-constrained buildings like public schools, Pratt said. Yet regardless of whether the city receives the money, the work to reduce emissions from large buildings will continue, she said, adding that Evanston committed to adopting a building performance standard a few years ago without the promise of federal funding. “
Jessica Miller from the Institute for Market Transformation, who served on a committee that helped the city develop its ordinance, pointed out that the country’s first building performance standards were passed during the first Trump administration. “

Energy storage is having a moment — but the batteries that are taking off today only have enough juice to provide a few hours of grid power. Developers technically could stack up more batteries for longer-term storage, but that gets prohibitively expensive. For a renewables-dominated grid to ride out days of poor solar production or even just an entire night, a breakthrough in cost-effective, longer-term storage is needed.
Over the last couple decades, venture capitalists have recognized this transformative possibility and heaped billions of dollars into the sector known as long-duration energy storage, or LDES
A few weeks ago, I saw something in the desert outside Reno, Nevada, that got me thinking the investors and startups may have been barking up the wrong tree all along.
Former Tesla Chief Technology Officer JBunveiled a surprising new project in June at the Tahoe campus of his lithium-ion recycling company, Redwood Materials. Instead of ripping apart old electric vehicle battery packs, his engineers arranged them across a patch of desert and hooked them up to an adjacent solar field. This assemblage now stores so much clean power that it can run a small on-site data center, rain or shine, night or day.
In other words, instead of inventing a brand-new technology tailored for long-term storage, Redwood made it way cheaper to stack enough time-tested lithium-ion batteries to accomplish that goal.
Unveiling this new business line, Straubel wasn’t just diversifying his revenue streams. He was staking claim to the long-duration storage market writ large.
““
As he spoke, Straubel pointed at a bar graph depicting the costs of those types of LDES
It’s a big claim. Second-life battery development is even newer than the LDESB2U and Element Energy, had built large-scale second-life storage plants, and those were just in the last few years. The sector has a lot of work to do to convince customers and financiers that the gently used battery packs can be trusted to hold up over years of service. And with new lithium-ion packs getting ever cheaper, the discount offered by used batteries may prove tenuous.
Still, Straubel’s first operating project, which holds 63
## Starting off bigger and cheaper than LDES
At the June event, Straubel essentially asserted that his band of desert engineers, in just a few months of tinkering, has outmaneuvered the researchers and companies working on long-duration for decades.
That deserves some scrutiny — but even pinpointing the costs of the competition is challenging.
““
Redwood says its second-life battery installations cost less than $15024482024
Iron-air is under development, most famously, by Straubel’s former Tesla Energy compatriot Mateo Jaramillo at Form Energy, a VCraised more than $12 to date. Redwood calculated iron-air costs at higher than $150below $20 when its factory reaches full production scale.
It’s worth noting that not all these technologies are directly comparable, because companies design and market them at different durations based on their technical sweet spots. If a technology works especially well at, say, 1248
“VC“
Epistemological issues aside, Redwood accurately diagnoses that the LDES
Brand-new lithium-ion batteries aren’t economically viable at longer durations, though their limits keep expanding as battery prices fall.
“
Pumped-hydro and compressed-air energy storage work for longer durations, but they are huge, billion-dollar infrastructure projects of the sort that don’t get built anymore in the U.S. (Canadian company Hydrostor is attempting to break that curse with a $15500MW4000 in California; if it gets permits to build, it might be online by 2030

Meanwhile, many LDES

Flow batteries have built up considerable installed capacity in China, but that trend hasn’t gotten much coverage in English-language press, said Eugene Beh, CEO

After building a pilot and a commercial project in Sardinia, Energy Dome just announced an
These more out-of-the-box LDES
Second-life companies take hundreds of batteries from different manufacturers, with different patterns of wear and tear, then operate them all in concert. If that was easy, more people would be doing it by now. Firms that get this wrong could start fires, and fire safety is one of the key arguments used against lithium-ion installations, both by rival technologists and the general public.
Then again, Straubel has as much experience as anyone with the inner workings of lithium-ion batteries. At Tesla, he built the nation’s leading electric-car company and a wildly successful stationary-storage business with the Powerwall and Megapack.
Then there’s the question of longevity. The batteries were pulled out of vehicles for a reason: usually due to their capacity degrading, though other problems develop with age, like higher internal resistance, which makes batteries heat up during discharge. If second-life packs need to be swapped out too frequently, it undercuts the ease and cheapness of the model.
That leaves the matter of supply. Success in second-life depends on a steady and cheap source of gently used EV1EV5
The available supply of used EV“10“2030
Indeed, he added, the growth in volume of used EV
## Lithium just keeps winning
It’s too soon to know if used EV
In doing so, Redwood puts a new spin on an energy-storage maxim that venture capitalists keep forgetting, or simply ignoring: Lithium-ion always wins.
Challengers that rely on different chemistries have to build up from negligible production scale and convince customers to take a chance on a design that few people have seen before. It’s a clear uphill battle.
Lithium-ion batteries, in contrast, command an unmatched and ever-expanding scale of industrial production, mostly in China but increasingly in the U.S. too. That manufacturing juggernaut unlocks incremental gains from economies of scale and continual innovation. It also confers consumer confidence, because the technology has such a clear track record of performance.

While grid scale storage is the main focus there are areas where power outages from storms are a real concern. Refrigerator not working ? Very bad. I suspect that many of the battery cells from used EV packs could still be useful. I've often found that flashlight batteries are not ""all"" bad. Some still have a good amount of energy. Every home has a wall (perhaps in a garage) that could accommodate these cells...floor to ceiling. Sensors could isolate a ""suspect cell"" and later replaced. But providing home power would kind of ""save the day"". Instead of a lost resource these cells would be ""re-purposed"".

!A large coal plant with multiple smokestacks is viewed from afar during the day

The Trump administration is threatening to force U.S. grid operators and utilities to keep money-losing coal-fired power plants running, no matter how dirty and expensive their power is.
Its stated reason? To shore up the reliability of the U.S. power grid.
It’s the latest salvo in a long-running battle over the country’s increasingly brittle grid — one that pits those in favor of hanging on to fossil fuels, and particularly coal, against those who put their faith in a future powered by cleaner and cheaper alternatives.
That battle is entering a critical phase as the grid faces challenges on multiple fronts.
Ever more intense summer heat waves and winter cold snaps driven by climate change are already straining the grid. An unprecedented boom in electricity demand, spurred by AIaging and unprofitable coal power plants have been closing at a rapid clip — and grid backlogs are preventing new solar, wind, batteries, and even fossil-gas plants from being built fast enough to replace them.
If these imbalances persist, more than half of North America faces 102024build more fossil gas–fired power plants and
But energy experts insist that there’s no single, simple solution to this high-stakes challenge. Maintaining reliability will certainly require retaining some otherwise unprofitable fossil-fueled power plants. But it also requires pressing utilities and regional grid operators to rapidly bring solar, wind, and batteries online — and enlisting electricity users to shift power use to reduce costly peaks in demand.
This multifaceted approach would bolster the grid without sacrificing cost and climate concerns. Flocking back to coal and ratcheting up gas, meanwhile, would cost consumers more, increase climate and air pollution, and ultimately result in a less diversified and therefore more fragile grid than one balanced by renewables.
In the longer term, the U.S. must break barriers to building far more high-voltage power lines to connect clean energy across regions and share power when extreme weather strikes, experts say. It also needs to support the economics for “advanced nuclear and enhanced geothermal power, or long-duration energy storage systems that can fill the gaps when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing.
“
“
## Why coal isn’t going to save the grid
Baldwin’s “
Last week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order that authorizes the Department of Energy to prevent uneconomical coal plants from closing, even if they’re violating federal and state carbon and environmental mandates and imposing higher power costs on customers. This would be the most aggressive federal intervention in modern history into the authority of states to regulate utilities, and of regional grid operators to manage competitive energy markets.
Many Republicans in Congress have long insisted that grid reliability problems are primarily caused by climate and clean-energy policies put in place by states and the Biden administration. They argue that regulations, not economics, are forcing coal plants into “
During “
Under questioning, most representatives of the U.S. grid operators, which are responsible for managing the systems that deliver electricity to about two-thirds of U.S. customers,
But Rep. Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat and ranking member on the energy subcommittee, pushed back on Republicans’ framing. Instead of trying to keep coal plants open, he said, utilities, grid operators, and regulators must clear bottlenecks preventing new clean energy and energy storage from taking over the role that fossil fuels have previously played.
Grid operators are ““
Instead, Republicans are considering repealing the clean-energy tax credits created by the 2022
“
## Getting the grid-reliability diagnosis right
Pallone’s comments underscore two of the biggest problems facing the U.S. grid.
The first is that coal simply cannot compete economically against alternatives. Coal has dwindled to providing only about 15, as both fossil gas and renewables fall in cost. Last year, solar, wind, and batteries alone made up more than 90 of the 56lead new additions in 2025, too.
The second problem is that many U.S. utilities and grid operators have been unable to move fast enough to embrace the advantages of cheap, clean energy. As Energy Innovation’s February report highlights, “
Much of the reluctance from certain grid operators stems from the fact that solar and wind ebb and flow with the weather, whereas fossil-fueled power plants can be turned on and off on command.
“CEOPJM65
But daytime solar production and nighttime wind generation can still provide a large and predictable amount of the power needed during hot summer afternoons and evenings and cold winter mornings, when demand for electricity spikes and reliability issues loom, said Wilson Ricks, a researcher and energy-modeling expert at Princeton University’s ZERO.
Meanwhile, lithium-ion batteries are becoming a more cost-effective way to store clean power for use when the grid needs it, he said. Utility-scale batteries deployed in California and Texas are storing gigawatts of solar power to cover peak grid demands during sunset and evening hours, for example.
Taken together, “
Real-world experience bears this out, said Ric O’Connell, founding executive director of GridLab, a think tank that contributed to the Energy Innovation reliability report. The standout example is Texas, which is adding wind, solar, and batteries faster than any other state.
The transmission grid operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas “85helped cover the absence of fossil-fueled plants that were shut down for seasonal maintenance, he noted.
Similarly, Southwest Power Pool, which manages a grid stretching from the Dakotas to Oklahoma,
Last year, on California’s solar- and battery-rich grid, grid operator CAISO100with 100 for at least a part of each day. Gigawatts of battery capacity also improved the state’s summer grid reliability by shifting solar power into the evenings.
That’s a big change from the summers of 20202022CAISOCEO

By contrast, O’Connell said, PJM“PJM‘‘
## Crying wolf on ​“
PJM
The region expects to lose about 40202030inability to interconnect new resources to replace what it’s losing.
For years, PJM conducted by other grid operators. It has also failed until recently to undertake the kind of regional grid expansion plans that have been done by grid operators in Texas, California, and the Midwest, which have enabled them to bring much more clean energy online.
Critics say PJMPJM
Instead, state regulators and grid operators have been forced to use costly emergency mechanisms to keep power plants from closing. In Maryland, for example, PJMused its “ to pay the owners of coal- and oil-fired power plants to postpone their retirements until at least 2028
The high price tag of these emergency stay-open measures highlights the economic burden of poor planning around power plant retirements, O’Connell said.
Those costs are bound to rise if the Trump administration forces coal power plants to stay open under emergency orders — or even demands that
These poor economics are why backers of renewables are frustrated with those who insist that clean-energy policies are to blame for coal plants closing and thus for grid reliability challenges.
“
Karen Palmer, a senior fellow and director of the electric power program at think tank Resources for the Future, agreed that coal retirements are “
Nor are
And major wintertime grid emergencies of the past several years, such as the Texas grid collapse in February 20212022
No one technology is immune to weather stresses and disruptions. Subzero temperatures can freeze up wind turbines and sap battery capacity, and scorching temperatures reduce solar-panel output and dampen battery performance. But this reinforces the importance of a portfolio approach to solving reliability challenges, Baldwin said.
## No simple fix for a looming grid crisis
None of this is to downplay the complexity that grid operators face — particularly at a time when demand for electricity is growing at a pace not seen in decades.

Battery cyclers charge and discharge Inlyte’s iron-sodium batteries to test their efficiency and durability. (Inlyte Energy)
Antonio Baclig spent eight years as a researcher at Stanford University scouring as many battery designs as he could find in search of something cheap enough to transform the grid. He honed in on one from the 19802021
“
Now Inlyte has secured its first major utility contract, a crucial step in proving the viability of the technology.
Southern Co., which owns the biggest utilities in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi, has agreed to install an 8015
New types of batteries are notoriously difficult to bring from the lab to large-scale production. Many startups have toiled at this task for years, pitching anyone who will listen about the superiority of their technology. None have come close to unseating the dominant lithium-ion battery designs that have plummeted in cost over the last decade as China massively scaled up production. But researchers have concluded that lithium-ion batteries can never get cheap enough for the mass deployments of storage that will be needed to run a grid dominated by renewable energy.
The onus is on Inlyte, then, to avoid the lackluster fate of its peers and prove its exceptionality among the ragtag camp of lithium-ion alternatives. The company has three important things going for it: dirt-cheap cost of materials, a simpler-than-usual manufacturing process, and system-level round-trip efficiency on par with lithium-ion battery systems. (Round-trip efficiency is a metric for how much of the electricity stored in a battery can later be recovered. The technologies challenging lithium-ion tend to fare poorly on this front.) Plus, the work of researchers in prior decades has already helped speed Inlyte’s path to market.
## New riff on a forgotten battery
Some battery-startup founders have spent years toiling away in a lab on a favored chemistry, only to spend more years figuring out how to turn it into a viable product. Baclig, a materials scientist, surveyed the annals of battery science and plucked something off the proverbial shelf that had almost hit the big time but not quite.
He landed upon the family of sodium metal halide batteries, first developed in the late 19701987
The sodium-nickel-chloride chemistry became known in battery industry lore as the ZEBRA1990
Baclig contends that the historical abandonment of iron-salt chemistries did not reflect an intrinsic failing in the technology, just a different set of needs at the time. Today, with record solar panel installations reshaping electricity systems around the globe, there’s growing interest in cheap, long-term energy storage. And power plants don’t need to cram as much energy into a confined space as electric vehicles do.
“
Baclig reached out to the company that had pioneered the technology in the first place: Beta Research. That firm was looking for a new project to focus on as the Covid pandemic receded, Baclig said; after a year of conversations, he and Beta Research decided to join forces in 202282023
Since then, the team has worked at a steady clip to dial in the best iron cathode for the grid storage job. They also scaled up the size of each cell, which, unlike in lithium-ion batteries, takes the form of a ceramic tube that gets filled with powdered iron and salt. The new tubes hold 20
From there, Inlyte set about testing its new battery cells, culminating in a recent third-party engineering test of a 100“
!A person in protective gear opens a kiln filled with tubes.

The chance to innovate on a legacy design attracted the firm’s chief commercial officer, Ben Kaun, who spent many years analyzing alternative grid storage concepts for the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit research arm of the U.S. utility industry.
““
## Battery field test first, then domestic factory
Southern Co. will install and operate the first large-scale Inlyte battery system for at least a year as part of its ongoing efforts to test emergent long-duration storage technologies in a real-world environment.
The utility company was attracted to Inlyte’s low fire risk (it does not use flammable electrolytes like conventional lithium-ion batteries) and its ability to be sourced domestically, Southern Co. R&
“
The company’s subsidiary Georgia Power previously signed a landmark deal to test out another iron-based long-duration battery, from Form Energy, starting in 2026
Researchers from the Electric Power Research Institute, Kaun’s former employer, will document the results of the Inlyte installation and share them with utilities around the country.
“
Of course, habitually risk-averse utilities often prefer to test-drive new technologies in their own backyard, even if that duplicates efforts elsewhere. Many utilities continued to tiptoe into lithium-ion battery installations even after the batteries had been operating for years on a massive scale in other parts of the country.
Baclig, for his part, hinted at many more trial runs in the works for next year. These projects will be doable because Inlyte gained possession of a pilot-scale factory in the U.K. as part of the Beta Research acquisition. That facility can pump out megawatt-hour-sized volumes for early test projects, but it won’t keep up if Inlyte starts closing commercial deals.
Baclig has begun seeking a location for a factory in the U.S. Building a first-of-a-kind factory can be risky, but he stressed that four factories have been set up around the world for essentially the same technology, and the Beta Research team advised on all of them. The plan is to build at the same scale as those previous facilities, to minimize uncertainty around factory economics.
“‘“‘
Filling ceramic tubes with metal powders doesn’t require the same pinpoint precision as a lithium-ion battery factory. When companies construct lithium-ion factories in the U.S., they have tended to cost at least $1
Furthermore, the machinery to manufacture this unique battery does not come from China’s dominant battery sector, a boon at a time when the Trump administration’s tariffs are driving up prices on Chinese imports (even the equipment needed to build factories in America).
Going forward, Inlyte will need to move from field demonstration to customer contracts, and the company is focused on buyers who need power every day but also have occasional long-term backup requirements.
Inlyte is pursuing utilities like Southern Co., which must deliver power to a fast-growing region while surviving hurricanes and other extreme weather. The startup also has a dedicated pitch for providing data centers with backup energy: The long-lasting iron-sodium batteries can ostensibly replace both the instant response from uninterruptible power supply systems and the diesel generators that would kick in until power is restored. And the batteries could run every day to lower a data center’s demand from the grid.
Convincing data center owners to adopt Inlyte’s product will not be trivial, but that sector is struggling to find the power capacity to fuel its growth, not to mention maintain corporate commitments to sourcing clean electricity. If Inlyte can really deliver clean, long-lasting power that’s cheaper than fossil-fueled alternatives, it would almost certainly find willing takers with the ability to pay.

Places like Joliet and Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood have become overrun with heavy-duty trucks as warehouses crop up, bringing excessive diesel pollution with them. Replacing those trucks with zero-emissions vehicles would improve air quality, especially in frontline communities that face higher pollution burdens.
Back in California, concrete progress on electrifying heavy-duty trucks is still happening, Canary Media’s Jeff St. John reports. Two all-electric charging depots just opened last month — infrastructure that will allow electric trucking to keep on growing, despite all the potholes ahead.

In Ohio, county and township officials have a lot of influence over permitting decisions for wind and solar farms.
So when local elected officials oppose a project, it matters whether they are doing so in their official role or as private individuals, says the developer of a central Ohio solar project.
Open Road Renewables is seeking to build an agrivoltaics project of up to 500a majority of public commenters support the project. However, the state’s deference to local opponents, through legislation and regulatory decisions, has made Ohio a challenging place to develop large clean energy projects.

The company is urging state regulators to view many of the comments as personal opinions rather than official government positions. Some local governments have formally weighed in, but Open Road alleges the county and some townships didn’t follow open meetings rules or allowed members with conflicts of interest to participate in votes.
““
How state regulators factor local views into permitting decisions is the subject of a pending case before the Ohio Supreme Court, in which a solar developer is challenging the state siting board’s use of local opposition to justify its decision to reject a permit.
Whether comments represent official action versus individual opinions affects how the state board perceives them, according to Heidi Gorovitz Robertson, a professor at Cleveland State University College of Law.

New Jersey’s Attorney General Matthew Platkin “
In an exclusive interview with Canary Media, Platkin said the motivation for challenging the anti-wind directive ““
Tensions have been high between many of the states that are all in on wind energy and President Donald Trump since his first day in office, when he pressed pause on new wind development with an executive order. The order halted the approval of leases, permits, and loans for wind energy, pending a federal review. The move dealt a particularly strong blow to the country’s still-emerging offshore wind efforts — and to Northeastern states like New Jersey that have based decarbonization goals and grid planning around the construction of offshore wind farms.
At the time of Trump’s executive order, the nine commercial-scale offshore wind projects that already had federal permits in hand appeared safe from the pause. But Trump’s anti-wind directive has since been cited in federal actions to derail two of those fully permitted projects, including New Jersey’s only fully permitted project.
In March, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency clawed back a clean-air permit from New Jersey’s Atlantic Shores wind farm, using the January executive order as its main justification. A month later, the Interior Department cited Trump’s directive in a stop-work order issued to New York’s Empire Wind 1, a massive 810just started at-sea construction.
The attorneys general are asking a federal court in Massachusetts to declare the president’s directive illegal, in part because the administration provided no “10
Joining New Jersey in the filing are Democrat-led states Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington. The District of Columbia also joined.
Barbara Kates-Garnick, a professor of the practice at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, said the coalition’s coastal states could be influential in the outcome of the lawsuit. Massachusetts and New Jersey, she noted, are small states without much pipeline infrastructure to rely on to expand energy sources like fossil gas. Nor do they have much land to build utility-scale solar. But they have significant offshore wind resources — and they’ve already spent years investing in and planning to develop those assets.
“
This lawsuit is the state of New Jersey’s strongest rebuke yet against the U.S. government’s obstruction of its ability to follow its own clean energy laws and goals.
In 2022112040“183
Platkin spoke with Canary Media Monday about how the lawsuit came to be and the rationale behind it.
This discussion has been edited for clarity and brevity.
Canary Media: What is the origin story for this multistate lawsuit?
Matthew Platkin:20242025
He’s now illegally trying to shut down the wind industry at a time when the president is saying we want to increase domestic energy production. And we’re trying to ensure that we can address climate change. Also, we’re dealing with rising costs. It just makes no sense — on top of it being illegal.
The Trump administration’s EPA
We’re looking at everything they are doing. Based on the number of lawsuits that our office has successfully filed, they’re violating the law at a very unprecedented pace. And they’re harming people here. So when it comes to wind, it’s not a policy question in my job. It’s a question of whether the law is being violated. And one of the things that they’ve done with this wind order, and as you heard in other instances as well, is yanking permits unlawfully, both unconstitutionally and in violation of statute.
It was notable to me that, in the EPA
This administration seems to think that executive orders carry the force of law outside of some underlying legal authority. For example, an executive order can implement a statute or a constitutional authority. It cannot create new powers. But they seem to be confused about that, given the number of times they’ve tried to rely on executive orders to do unlawful things.
When the federal government issued Empire Wind a stop-work order, was that a tipping point for this group of attorneys general?
It’s hard for me to say what the tipping point is for all of us. I think certainly the executive order was a major point. For us to have a basis for challenging, you have to have standing. We try to bring a suit when they are ready to be brought, when they are ripe for challenge.
What is important for the public to know, when it comes to this lawsuit, about why it was brought by New Jersey specifically?
This is a time when we’re dealing with rising costs, when everyone agrees we should be increasing domestic energy production. To just unlawfully shut down an entire industry, simply because you don’t like it for political purposes or because you want to serve the interests of Big Oil, it just makes no sense. It’s flagrantly illegal, but it also just makes no sense.

Minnesota State Capitol Credit:
A state-funded climate financing authority will begin ramping up lending in Minnesota this year after hiring its first executive director in October.
The Minnesota Climate Innovation Finance Authority, established by state legislators as part of a flurry of climate and clean energy bills in 202325
The timing — as the Trump administration sows
Kari Groth Swan, the state authority’s executive director, said she hopes to use her background in banking and community development to help connect promising projects with state and private money.
She recently spoke with the Energy News Network about the launch of the program, which has already drawn dozens of applications.
What kind of projects are eligible?
The finance authority seeks to fund projects that help Minnesota meet its climate action goals, including the
How does it work?
The funding process is similar to what conventional lenders use. Applicants provide two years of financials, a narrative, a project budget, a list of commitments from other funders, and other financial information.
““
A governing board appointed by Gov. Tim Walz makes the final lending decisions. The board includes representatives of state agencies, industry organizations, tribal nations, labor unions and people from other professions.
Why does the state need a green bank?
Green banks are mission-driven to promote clean energy projects, and have technical expertise in energy lending. Minnesota’s green bank intentionally focuses on underserved markets unlikely to receive all their capital from private lenders. By deploying a lending institution rather than relying on grants for clean energy projects, the state creates a revolving fund as loans are repaid.
The finance authority won’t ever be the primary lender on a project, but having the state involved helps move projects forward, Swan said. The green bank has a pipeline of $25265
Swan said the first wave of applicants came fully formed and with significant capital in place. The second wave might need some additional advocacy with lenders. “‘
How large are the loans?
A wide range of loan amounts are available. The green bank requires a minimum loan amount of $250000110
How much money is available?
By statute, the bank must lend at least $254520246025
What other requirements are there?
Half of the loans must meet guidelines for environmental justice communities based on the 4035200
How could President Trump’s attacks on federal clean energy affect the program
Swan thinks federal investment tax credits for clean energy will survive under Trump, adding that unwinding them quickly will be challenging because they’re part of the tax code. But the Trump administration has already signaled a willingness to usurp Congress’ constitutional spending authority when it comes to clean energy, which could mean a greater need for money but also fewer projects ready to fund in Minnesota.

On March 6
At a time of year when Canadian hydropower typically supplies up to a tenth of New England’s power, the region has instead gone almost a month with virtually no cross-border flow of electrons.
Hydro‑Québec leaders say low prices in the New England market — not politics — are behind the decision to suspend sales. The disruption hasn’t affected power costs or reliability in the region yet, but some experts say it could if the cutoff extends into the summer cooling season. The situation also highlights a potential risk to state clean energy plans that count on Canadian hydropower to help offset fossil fuels.
“
Hydro‑Québec’s main transmission line into New England, known as the Phase II1200MW510
The longer that New England needs to replace the absent hydropower, the more often it will call on natural gas or oil power plants to fill the gap with dirtier and more expensive electricity, particularly as demand increases in the summer and again next winter.
““
## The future of Canadian energy in New England
In an email from a company spokesperson, Hydro‑Québec attributed its lack of exports to market conditions, saying milder spring weather has lowered demand and thus prices. Others have theorized the move is also a show of power
Hydro‑Québec has been sending signals for a while that it might be moving away from delivering power to New England at its historic levels. Last year, 5560II2022ISO2024
This pullback is likely due, at least in part, to ongoing abnormally dry and drought conditions in much of Quebec, which mean less water flow to power the company’s generators. Hydro-Québec, therefore, faces choices about what to do with the power it can generate, whether that means holding out for higher prices on the New England market or selling it domestically to meet the province’s own growing demand as it too electrifies in pursuit of climate goals.
“2024
The lack of exports from Hydro-Québec coupled with the specter of fluctuating tariffs and counter-tariffs brings into focus the need for the New England grid to develop more stateside power resources and expand the infrastructure required to get energy where it’s needed, experts said.
““
Some are also concerned that ISO2000MW“
The situation has also raised questions about the 1451200MW202026
Recent circumstances, however, have those in the industry combing over the contracts to determine how solid Hydro-Québec’s commitment to deliver that power actually is and how tariffs might affect the terms of the deal. One promising sign, they said: The company is still sending electricity into the U.S. over a second, smaller transmission line that ends in Vermont, which has an agreement to buy power from Hydro-Québec until 2038
““
In the meantime, the region will just have to wait and see what Hydro-Québec does next, without much information to go on.

Very unlikely that this has anything to do with Trump or tariffs. Quebec is interested in making money long-term and will honor any contracts. It was Ontario Premier Doug Ford bloviating about cutting off electricity, even though Ontario is simply connected to a larger midwestern power grid and is not a major supplier. Quebec and Manitoba officials, who actually do have power supply contracts, were likely appalled by his grandstanding.

I understand that Quebec exports hydro power using DC current and Ontario exports hydro power using AC current. I'm not sure how this applies to the discussion. I believe that using DC voltage surges isolates Canada from voltage surges that may occur in the USA.

If the New England grid is desperate enough for power, I would think they'd be willing to increase the monetary incentive to get HQ to sell their power. Also, I am doubtful HQ would refuse to send power in a situation where grid stability is at risk. It sure would be bad optics for them if another August 2003 happens because they refuse to send power.

The simplest explanations are usually correct.
Quebec not participating in auctions is more a reflection that the province will have less excess power to export due to (1) - Quebec's reduction upon hydrocarbons for home heating + automobiles and (2) - the long list of power-hungry manufacturers setting up business in Quebec.
You would be informed if when we send a message.

The U.S. is still on track to build a record amount of new solar capacity this year, even as the Trump administration works to obstruct renewables.
As it stands, the power industry is building more solar than any other type of power plant, which has been the case for several years running. Roughly 1221
![]( In recent years, solar has dominated new power plant construction, along with batteries and wind. (EIA)
Solar thus will contribute more than half of the expected 6493, the EIA2025582002
Those facts reflect a set of hopeful trends: The U.S. is building power plants at a record pace; nearly all of those new plants will not emit carbon emissions; and, since renewables and batteries cost far less to operate than fossil fuel plants, they exert downward pressure on electricity costs. These are all good things to see at a time when demand for new power production is soaring — thanks to electrification, industrial growth, and an AIsteadily rising electricity rates.
Of course, these trends could prove short-lived, because the Trump administration is actively working to obstruct the buildout of clean and cheap energy.
This summer’s signature Republican domestic policy law targeted wind and solar with early termination of their tax credits, effectively raising the cost to deploy these types of power plants. The executive branch has sought to halt or inhibit offshore wind and renewable development on public lands. Simultaneously, the Trump administration is giving an artificial boost to fossil-fuel plants. The Department of Energy is invoking emergency powers to block the planned shutdown of the J.H. Cambpell coal-fired plant in Michigan, forcing customers to pay millions of dollars extra to preserve an outdated, uneconomical facility. Analysts fear the DOE
Any clean power plants coming online this year were planned, permitted, and undergoing construction before Trump’s policy shifts took effect (though his officials have found ways to interrupt construction that was fully permitted, like the Empire Wind project off the coast of New York). In that sense, this year’s buildout offers the last snapshot of what it looks like when the electricity industry serves market demand with modern technologies absent active resistance from the U.S. government.
It’s still possible that momentum will carry the solar industry to another record year in 2026start construction by the first half of 2026 to claim the full tax credit, and the administration recently tightened the longstanding tax rules on what counts as “

Nice looking graph. If humans were not built on psychosis, it would be easy to imagine that we are finally making the turn on the bell curve that could lead to survival. But, alas, we are quite certainly and decidedly psychotic. A comparison of the progression of this terminal condition, as demonstrated by the complete transition of the US federal government to majority psychotic, shown in similar graph would quickly turn any optimism to complete impending doom. But, as any delusional psychos should, let's turn to our tool of hope - and remember the old saying that it's always darkest just before the dawn.....

It’s been a grim five weeks for the clean energy transition in North Carolina. From
President Donald Trump’s edicts against climate spending and wind and solar aren’t the only problem. Earlier this month, Duke Energy quietly proposed a massive new fossil-gas plant in Person County to help replace two aging coal units that advocates say seldom operate.

Unlike much of the Midwestern, coal-based steel production that supplies the domestic automotive industry, the Hyundai Steel plant in Ascension Parish, roughly an hour west of New Orleans in the heart of the Bayou State’s so-called Cancer Alley, proposes to use an electric arc furnace. This technology is increasingly popular in the U.S. and around the world, and if powered by clean electricity it can produce steel without emitting nearly any CO2

How easily Hyundai’s plant could be retrofitted to use green hydrogen later depends on which of the two major manufacturers of DRI

Everyone agrees that California’s major utilities are charging too much for electricity. But as in previous years, state lawmakers, regulators, and consumer advocates are at odds over what to do about it.
With the state’s three biggest utilities reporting record profits even as customers’ rates have skyrocketed, critics say the time is right to pass laws that will force regulators to more tightly control key utility costs — or even outright curb utility spending and profits.
Customers of Pacific Gas &&4720192023
Rates are set to climb even further in the coming years as utilities look to expand their power grids to meet growing demand from data centers, electric vehicle charging depots, and millions of households buying EVs and heat pumps. Utilities also need to build high-voltage transmission lines to connect far-off clean energy resources to population centers. And they need to harden and protect thousands of miles of low-voltage power lines to prevent deadly wildfires in a landscape that’s growing more susceptible to conflagration because of climate change.
Utilities are allowed to earn a profit on these infrastructure investments and to pass the costs onto customers — but only within reason. It’s the job of regulators to ensure that profits aren’t disproportionate to what utilities charge ratepayers.

Other energy analysts, including some who strongly disagree with Lynch’s views on rooftop solar, share this perspective on the grid’s role in driving up utility costs.

Going after those costs is tricky, however. When it comes to generation, utilities can’t back out of contracts for expensive power, even if they were signed more than a decade ago. Nor can they avoid buying power on the state’s energy markets during times when those prices spike.
Tackling grid costs puts regulators and lawmakers in a bind as well. Nobody wants utilities to skimp on critical investments like replacing aging equipment or protecting power lines from being knocked down by trees or high winds. Efforts to police utility grid investments risk forcing regulators and utilities to spend lots of time and effort delving into the minutiae of those plans without any clear promise of savings to show at the end of it.
Even so, Toney highlighted several bills being proposed this year, and others he hopes will be revived from last year’s session, that could drive down some of these costs.
On wildfire-related expenditures, he’d like to see a new bill that revives the policies proposed by CPUC

California could also find other ways to pay for grid investments, Toney said.

## How far can California go to control utility spending?
Some consumer advocates say lawmakers and regulators need to go after rising rates directly by limiting the return on investment that utilities are permitted to pass on to customers. Utility critics say that’s the most direct way to halt rate increases.
It’s also the most likely to trigger major pushback from utilities.

Canary Media’s ​“Electrified Life” column shares real-world tales, tips, and insights to demystify what individuals can do to shift their homes and lives to clean electric power.
Have you been sitting on the sidelines, waiting to decarbonize your home and commute?
It may be time to jump into action.
The “Big, Beautiful Bill” that President Donald Trump signed on July 4and even sooner for EVs — none of those incentives will be available.

Besides improving indoor air quality, switching to a heat pump lowers energy bills by hundreds of dollars for the majority of households, according to electrification nonprofit Rewiring America. Savings climb still higher by installing heat-pump water heaters and rooftop solar. These benefits are especially salient as utility bills rise nationwide, a trend that experts expect the new law to exacerbate.
In addition to the tax credits, households may also be able to access federal home-energy rebates, depending on their state; that Biden-era program was untouched by the new legislation.
Here’s a run-through of the federal incentives that are, for now, available to help you electrify your life.
## Upgrade your home

## Making microgrids happen
For years now, Lewin has been calling on state leaders to focus on helping customers save energy and keep power flowing during hurricanes, heat waves, and winter storms. He thinks microgrids are a good way to do that.
When the broader grid is functioning well, facilities equipped with microgrids can use their solar, batteries, and generators to reduce their use of grid power. But when the grid goes down or experiences serious stress, those facilities can rely on those resources to continue running.
Microgrids could also help meet ballooning power demand from homes, businesses, factories, and especially data centers chasing the AImassive share of future load growth forecasts, he said. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the grid operator for most of the state, forecast in April that peak electricity demand could

Enchanted Rock has joined other backup generation providers including Bloom Energy, Base Power, Cummins, Generac, Mainspring Energy, and Power Secure in what Yu called an “18
Most of these companies focus on gas-fueled power generation systems, whether those are linear generators from Mainspring, or battery backup systems, as with startup Base Power, or combine solar, batteries, and energy control systems with generators, as with Generac.

Different combinations could offer more favorable economics for different types of customers. Some may find that lots of solar panels are useful for lowering day-to-day utility bills, while others may want to maximize gas-fueled generation to cover multiday winter outages, when solar-charged batteries are less useful.
The legislation creating the program does limit projects from actively playing in the grid operator’s market programs, Yu added, meaning microgrid owners will face restrictions on selling the power they generate or the grid-balancing services they can provide to the market.

Jetson says its average heat-pump installation cost is way less than the national average: just $15000
Many markets also offer thousands of dollars in heat-pump rebates, which the startup deducts from what customers pay out of pocket. In these spots, Jetson can offer heat pumps in some cases for as little as $5000

## A new business model to deploy heat pumps
Jetson is taking a fresh approach to deliver its low heat-pump prices: vertical integration.
Traditionally, equipment manufacturers sell heat pumps to brands, which sell them to distributors, who sell them to HVAC

Jetson cuts out the middlemen. It buys the heat pumps, stores them in its own warehouses, and has its own in-house installers ride out in the company’s electric vans to put the appliances in homes, Lake said.
Using custom software, Jetson also cuts costs by scoping heat pump projects virtually rather than sending someone out to each would-be customer. Last year, Jetson acquired whole-home decarbonization startup Helio Home and built upon its thermal modeling software that can accurately size heat pump systems remotely. In most cases, the first time an installer comes to an abode is to put in the heat pump. The company additionally uses proprietary software to process rebates.

What about repairs for Jetson heat pumps? For example, standard advice for traditional heat pumps is either pick an installer and buy what they support, or pick a heat pump then (try to) find an installer. Either way, that installer can fix the heat pump when it breaks. Vital in less urban areas.

I love almost everything about this, except ""The tech also lets Jetson monitor a system’s performance"". Does it also let the homeowner monitor performance? If Jetson goes belly up, does the homeowner still have access to this software, or is their smart HVAC system now a dumb HVAC system?

As someone who follow this space pretty close, this feels really significant. The US HVAC industry is being held back at every layer, from manufactures and supply houses, to HVAC techs running around trying to keep up with all the problems that they themselves are creating. This kind of vertical integration might be one of the few ways to cut through it all.

A mix of reactions
1. I like the model, wonder when /if any big dog manufacturer might duplicate it ( like Anderson in windows) . These guys don’t manufacture it so in essence they are still a bit of a middleman but w a custom design/private label. 2 ) details ? What Seer and heat efficiency - I image they are either good or have a range but who knows- do they also offer any minisplits? If so do they work in tandem w central? ( I have both in my house)
2. $30 k is average competitor, wow, and they are half yet that half is more than the 12k I paid in MD to replace a 15 yr old heat pump? Mine was only a Trane 14 seer, and it was a replacement of a heat pump not a new install or a replacement of oil - so at 1st glance I can’t make sense of this, again details matter.
3. love the advanced tech approach and love even more the integration w rebates- I had 3 bids and zero input much less integration w rebates, - my bad that I researched it later when filing taxes and it seems like I should have paid the extra $2k for a 16 seer that would have qualified- in knowledgeable contractors are inexcusable- they are in the biz every day vs the layman homeowner- what subpar service are we paying for- live and learn.

Finally a company that allows the user the benefits of technology especially the on board diagnostics . No more paying for routine not needed service. Also I like the idea of his company finally telling all that heat pumps need special considerations to operate down to 22 degrees. Many disappointed users because that fact was not explained at purchase especially those living in the NE USA .. I for one when living there.. When are you coming to SC???

They look like Mini-Splits. Technically it is a heat pump but there's no inside duct work or air handler needed, hence the much lower cost than a regular heat pump.

That’s where 3 Infrastructure comes in, Gunnels said. Since launching last year, the New York–based startup has 3 is installing chargers at hundreds of sites in 172030
Getting big is key to 3’s business model, Gunnels said. Many “ already cover the cost of chargers in exchange for monthly fees or other payback structures. But 3 isn’t asking property owners for any money at all, she explained — just a 10
That means it’s up to 3 to pick the right properties, install the right number of chargers in the right locations, keep them in good working order, and decide how much it needs to charge users to make its money back.

## A business model for EV
In that sense, 3’s business model more closely resembles that of the public charging operators that rely on electricity sales to earn back their up-front costs. That’s inherently riskier than getting someone to pay you to install and operate EVEV
It is, after all, still early days for the EVfirst public charger deployments were boosted by significant government or utility incentives to make up for the fact that there weren’t enough EVs on the road to reliably finance their costs.

Gunnels conceded that 3’s customers will need to have faith in its ability to execute on its 10
That’s important for aligning the long-term incentives of the charging business, she believes. ““
3’s conservative approach may limit the scope of markets and properties that the company goes after. ”EV3 will also limit how many chargers it installs at each property during its initial deployment phases, as the company tests its utilization forecasts against reality.
The key to success, Gunnels said, is scale and diversity. Each individual project may be relatively small — costing, say, between $30000100000142

It would be interesting to know how the logistics would work for residents. This will work if people can plug in, charge quickly, and then move their cars. How do you make that easy? How do you motivate people (e.g. with extra fees for staying too long) without leaving people with unreasonable penalties if they forget to move the car or can't move it due to some unplanned issue? How do users who get home after all slots are full know when there is an open slot? I would not relish walking to the parking lot every 15 minutes every night of my life.
I wonder if it would work to have many connection points, even if they can't all be powered simultaneously. With the right controls a resident could plug in at 6 PM, perhaps not get charged immediately, but know that before they leave the next morning their car will get its turn to be charged. If the cables to each car are cheap relative to the power infrastructure this could work economically, though maybe best in new construction.
Just thinking...

Patrick, in your units (since you describe yourself as an owner, I'm assuming you have renters, that is, not a condo building), what percent of your occupants already have an EV? Have you polled them to see if more EVs will be purchased if EV chargers, are available?
I'm assuming the renters will pay for the ""juice"" and the EV charging company's overhead and company profits.

France is currently implementing rapid, massive, widely distributed solar parking lot canopy +V2G charger installation at ALL parking lots larger than about 50 spaces, right where most people live & work, within 5 years. They didn't stop with investment incentives; they made it a mandate with non-compliance penalties. And the biggest parking lots have to comply within 3 years. Carrots aren't sufficient to make property owners & managers care about their tenants' utility bills. France brought the sticks. Bottom line: There isn't a faster way to develop widely distributed community solar micro grids delivering cheap reliable energy to everyone, with no new utility transmission, site acquisition or other site improvement spending required at large apartments & condos, BigBox & neighborhood shopping centers, business parks, & various public facilities like hospitals & schools.

France's plans are interesting, but it certainly seems like making it mandatory is going to boost overhead which will translate into higher rents. Unless of course everything is rent price controlled, which has its own pitfalls.
It seems the rate of EV sales in France is now between 22-25% of all new registrations, but, that still means the vast majority of cars in France run on fossil fuels. A quick search came up with 2024 numbers saying France has 1 million EVs registered out of 38.9 million cars. or less than 3%... Of course the bill requires this to happen within 5 years, so with 25% of new registrations being EVs, in 5 years that number should be 5% of all cars on the road. Might work out well, might prove an expensive boondoggle. Reality likely somewhere in between. Good luck France!

Landlords might not want to be subject to:
1. Theft of power losses, including credit card fraud
2. Demand charges, surcharge on electric bill if total usage by the building exceeds a certain amount in a given hour.
3. Miscellaneous liabilities from existence of charging station in the complex. Would the investment community or the power companies be interested in establishing concessions in apartment complexes to provide car charging, setting uncontrolled prices, collecting payments, and caring for the infrastructure? The landlord just provides the space for the concessions.

Well, if this company is contracting directly with the tenants, and owns the chargers, then the owners shouldn't have problem (as their contract may not make them liable for any expenses,, assuming there's a practical way to implement chargers (especially where there are shortages of parking spaces, ie most multi-unit rental properties.

Very informative! In thinking on this piece, it seems like there are a number of hurdles. Many multi-family buildings lack assigned parking spaces, which would make billing a problem, or need to set up a limited number specific charging spaces would see a rotation of users, but how to bill? In such case, it would be like a gas station. Put in your credit/debit card to charge up? Also having some EV specific spaces, could be a huge problem in buildings already short of spaces, which is likely the majority of buildings.
Most likely success exists if this and other companies target condos (and co-ops), rather than rented apartment buildings. At this point in time the majority of renters, are likely unable to afford an EV at US prices. And the percent of renters, with EVs, let's say, in a 50 unit building would have to be at least 10%, maybe a lot more, to make it even financially practical, I would think? Of course targeting condo owners, isn't exactly helping spread the use of EVs to folks at the lower end of the middle class financially, most often, renters.
Of course now, in 2025, something just north of 7% of vehicles on the US roads are EVs. And, I expect that almost all of those owners/leasers of EVs, are home/condo owners, not renters, due to the high entry price of EVs. Sure some folks with money prefer to rent, but that's the exception rather than the rule. And I suspect renting among higher income folks is mostly a big city thing, where many/most people don't need cars.
Still, this company seems to have a viable model, if, as they say, they will be selective with which buildings they work with. That said, good luck to them, in attempting to operate in renter only multi-family buildings, especially those with 50 units or less, as they may only have 1 renter with an EV, maybe 2? Could only having a handful of EVs in a building make this practical?

A legislative proposal in Maine that would impose new fees on community solar projects is having a chilling effect on solar developers, some of whom say they may stop working in the state, or even already have.
““
The
Nationally, net metering programs have been contentious, with states like California, New Hampshire, and North Carolina making big changes to mixed — and sometimes litigious — receptions. Maine’s system has been under scrutiny for years, as many critics say it has created excessive profits for developers while unfairly shifting costs to consumers who don’t even use solar power.
While many renewable energy advocates and developers agree that the program needs some reform, they say the current bill goes too far. The legislation outlines a new system for compensating commercial and industrial customers who own solar panels. Currently, the compensation rate is based on standard utility electricity rates, meaning solar owners make more revenue when power prices rise. The bill would require a new mechanism of gradual, annual rate increases to avoid excessive windfalls for solar owners when energy costs go up.
Of particular concern, however, are other provisions that apply to community solar developments, larger-scale installations that sell power to multiple rs.
In 20192021791008MW
““
The bipartisan legislation now under consideration would impose a monthly fee, paid by community solar owners to utilities. The money would be intended to cover the cost of delivering the solar power to consumers. Those “
Projects between 1MW3MW28056002 project, for example. Larger arrays between 3MW5MW6240004 installation. These rates would be increased as needed to keep up with the cost of maintaining and expanding the grid. The goal, proponents say, is to continue supporting solar in a way that does not add to residents’ financial hardships.
“
However, renewable energy advocates and solar developers say the monthly fees could scare away new projects as well as put existing operations at risk.
“CEO
Opponents question the way these fees came to be included in the bill. They were not in the original draft legislation, but the idea was raised and voted on during committee debate. The language is in the process of being officially added to the bill so that lawmakers can report it out of committee and send it to the House floor. It is concerning that the fees received no public hearing, and many stakeholders and lawmakers are not even aware they are being added in, said Eliza Donoghue, executive director of the industry group Maine Renewable Energy Association.
Even if this bill fails to pass, the damage may already be done: Investors in all sorts of clean energy segments are becoming wary of doing business in a state that would even consider retroactively changing the rules for projects that were designed and financed under a different set of expectations, opponents said.
“
Opponents also worry that the bill sends the inaccurate message that increasing solar adoption makes energy more expensive, when research suggests the reverse is true. In 202420247
Warren, however, says reining in even this modest increase could help some of her constituents.
““
Bill proponents are also not convinced by claims that the new rules would cause financial problems for developers. The provisions are designed to have less financial impact on smaller companies that are less able to take the hit, said Maine Public Advocate Heather Sanborn, a supporter of the bill.
The bill also contains important consumer protections that opponents aren’t talking about, Sanborn said. Community solar operators would be required to rightsize customers’ subscriptions, preventing them from paying for more credits than they can use. Should a customer still end up with more credits than they need, the operator would be required to issue a refund. The legislation would also encourage the installation of battery storage in conjunction with solar.
“
For opponents, however, the community solar fees are an intractable problem that outweighs any other provisions.

Gerry Runte - I have similar questions. My Massachusetts town owns its own ""municipal lighting plant"". Its fully loaded, total retail rate is 17.7 cents per kWh - which is about what you cite for worst case net PROFIT under the new terms for these Maine solar projects! Plus, our net metering policy gives me as a residential solar owner only the light plant's average wholesale cost per kWh, nowhere near the retail rate. It sounds like Maine extended an incredibly sweet deal to attract solar projects but now has buyer's remorse and wants to renege. We'll see if it passes and what the investor fallout will be. That said,, as a 77 year old who skimped for many years to be financially secure in my old age, backing off implied commitments to investors so that boomers on reverse mortgages can save $7.00 a month on electricity seems driven not so much by compassion but by the simple fact that they have a propensity to vote. Understandable, but that does not seem like a perspective that will bring prosperity to Maine and ignores the fact that it's young people who are going to ultimately pay the price climate change will exact. I for one would like to see more generational equity in this society. Young people - vote!

We ratepayers have been getting ripped off by CMP subsidizing solar farms at 38 cents per kwh for years. Time to stop the gravy train for developers and get CMP back to it's core function of just delivering electricity. Solar is intermittent and extremely costly with a major waste problem to manufacture and dispose of at end of service and gobbles up land. Those black panels are too hot to touch on a sunny day and radiate that heat into the environment.

While every project's financials differ, we know, with accuracy that a 5 MW kwh credit project can bill customers based on the then prevailing retail rate. If they offer a 15% discount, and sell their RECs, in 2026, their gross revenue will be about 23.5 cents/kwh. After the charge from this bill is applied, and assuming they are 7% underd, that leaves about 17 cents/kwh - 19 cents for projects less than 3 MW which have a lower charge, and 23.5 cents for those less than 1 MW. No question the bill represents a haircut for projects greater than 1 MW - but are these projects really unable to find a way to survive on this amount of revenue?

The article suggest that the bone of contention is a fee that CMP should collect for ""distribution"". Since CMP already has a mechanism for collecting distribution costs for any energy source, directly from customers, why would it not also do that for community solar sources? I really don't see why the government should get involved in a matter that is between the solar sources and the consumers buying their kWh. And why is the word ""subsidy"" being bandied about here, when we are talking about consuming rate payers? Admittedly, I'm new to this situation, though I've been on Community Solar since 2017, first in MD, now in ME.

Rep. Runte, respectfully, the answer is these projects see their return almost entirely down to zero and also violate their loan covenants and need to renegotiate loan terms with their lenders. The lenders will not take a loss and will require more equity to cover the loans where upon these Maine projects become negative or near negative equity return solar projects. No person or company would invest in such an arrangement. I have been involved as an expert on net metering projects in other states as you may know in front of other PUCs. This is an astonishingly poor bill and should be abandoned. If you must, please change the rules prospectively, not retroactively for those who have already put money into projects, steel in the ground in fair and reasonable reliance on the law and rules Maine established in 2019 through 2021.

The Trump administration insists that renewables are making energy more expensive and that more fossil-fueled power will reduce utility bills.

## Why clean power is cheaper power
The reason repealing these tax credits would drive up costs is simple, Orvis said. Solar and wind energy can supply U.S. power grids with electricity at lower long-term cost than alternatives such as coal, gas, and nuclear power plants. The more of it that can be built, the more it can supplant those costlier resources.
Over the past decade, solar and wind power have become the
In the U.S., newly built solar and wind farms can provide power at a cheaper rate than 99the country’s remaining coal plants. Even fossil gas, the workhorse of the U.S. grid, struggles to compete with new clean energy. A study from think tank RMIserve grid needs at a lower cost than newly built gas-fired power plants.
What’s more, the cost of solar and wind power isn’t tied to fluctuations in the price of fossil gas, which has driven significant electricity price increases in the past several years, Orvis said. That lack of fuel cost, along with lower operations and maintenance costs, make wind and solar a long-run winner financially.
Energy developers and utilities are following the money. Last year, solar, batteries, and wind made up more than 90 of the 56lead power plant construction and that battery installations will break records again in 2025
Wind and solar farms
Cutting off those tax credits would curtail that growth and leave the country more reliant on fossil-fueled power plants that would not only create planet-warming emissions and harmful local air pollution but cost U.S. consumers more money. That would add roughly $2020302035

## An ​‘
The Trump administration has moved to undo decades of federal policy seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, fight climate change, and protect the environment. It has also declared a “
Energy Secretary Wright, a longtime gas industry executive who &“
But that assertion is “primarily driven by increasingly extreme weather, which is linked to global warming. And while the variability of wind and solar power generation is intimately tied to weather, traditional power plants have proven to be far less reliable than their backers have claimed, particularly during winter cold snaps like those that led to massive grid outages in Texas in 2021 and across the U.S. Southeast in 2022.
As for clean energy’s relationship to rising electricity prices, an Energy Innovation report last year highlighted that surging electric utility costs in recent years are linked not to renewables but other factors, including spikes in fossil gas prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the increasing cost of expanding and maintaining utility power grids.
A report out last week from think tank Ember reiterated “
!Ember graph showing a lack of correlation between wind and solar power penetration and electricity rates in U.S. states (Ember)
Other states with aggressive clean-energy mandates, such as California and Massachusetts, also have some of the country’s most expensive electricity, the report says. But those costs are more closely driven by aging infrastructure, ““massive costs of wildfires, many caused by utility grid failures, and the investments meant to prevent more of them.
More broadly speaking, the cost of electric utility service is primarily tied to rising investments in utility transmission and distribution grids and the cost of fuel to power their generation, said Paul DeCotis, a senior partner at consultancy West Monroe. And “
In his speech at CERAWeek, Wright also mocked the idea that wind, solar, and batteries could completely replace fossil fuels for providing reliable round-the-clock generation capacity. But the U.S. isn’t facing that problem in the near term. Instead, it must cheaply and quickly build new capacity to meet the country’s growing power needs — and clean energy and batteries are best positioned to do that, according to energy industry analysts and executives.
The U.S. is experiencing a first-in-decades boom in demand for electricity, driven by new data centers and factories in the short term, and in the longer term by the push to shift from fossil-fueled to electric vehicles and building heating. A number of utilities are proposing to build gigawatts of new gas-fired power plants to meet that demand. But as of today, manufacturers of gas turbines say they’re unable to supply power plants not already in planning until 20282029

For decades, electrical engineers have dreamed of a device that can seamlessly connect solar panels, battery systems, and on-site generators to high-powered equipment like EV
Now, these devices, called solid-state transformers, are actually starting to hit the market — and they couldn’t be coming at a more opportune time.
That’s because the technology could be key to dealing with the torrent of power demand from data centers, factories, and electric-vehicle charging hubs that threatens to overwhelm the grid and cause utilities to burn more planet-warming fossil fuels.
Right now, these large electricity customers are clamoring for more power than the U.S. grid can easily supply. In theory, this problem could be solved by allowing them to install their own solar arrays, batteries, and generators on site — ideally as a microgrid — but that seemingly simple solution is actually complicated and costly to execute.
Every solar array, battery, fuel cell, generator, or other source of on-site power requires multiple pieces of equipment — electrical protection gear, isolation transformers, step-up and step-down transformers, power converters — to safely turn direct current into alternating current or vice versa, and to raise or lower voltages to match the needs of different loads within a building.
Solid-state transformers can do all that from a single device, controlling electricity as nimbly as routers control the flow of data. That’s particularly valuable when it comes to managing equipment with high power needs, like EV
So says Haroon Inam, CEODG1000

So if solid-state transformers are such a useful technology, why are they just now getting into the field?
There are good reasons why it’s taken so long, said Vlatko Vlatkovic, a veteran of General Electric’s industrial electrification business and a partner at DG
Much of the power grid relies on electromechanical devices that operate in relatively simple ways that haven’t changed much in a century. Despite recent advances that have enabled things like solar inverters or electric-vehicle drivetrains, the same kind of semiconductors that make modern computing possible have yet to be applied widely to the power grid.
““
Similar challenges have dogged solid-state transformers in higher-voltage industrial applications, said Neal Dikeman, a partner at Resilient Power investor Energy Transition Ventures. Consistent advances in silicon carbide semiconductors have helped, as have strides in the computing ability required to make them effective at power conversion, he said. “

It isn’t easy to trace the flows of electricity across a high-voltage transmission grid that spans 15
But doing so is necessary for states, companies, and other entities to track real progress toward decarbonization goals. Ultimately, it can be done — so long as you have the right data sources and the willingness to conduct some tricky analysis on power plant emissions and how power moves on the grid.
Just ask the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISOdeveloping open-source carbon emissions accounting software. In March, the partners unveiled a MISO
That data is useful for utilities offering “
Those were the two use cases detailed by Jordan Bakke, MISO““MISO
Greg Miller, research and policy lead at Singularity, said similar approaches could help companies that have contracted with wind and solar farms or nuclear power plants to determine how much of that carbon-free power is actually reaching their data centers, factories, and office buildings from hour to hour. That’s a big deal for corporate clean-energy buyers like Google and Microsoft that have committed to serving a growing amount of their enormous power needs with carbon-free electricity.

The end result isn’t as complete a picture as some might imagine, Miller emphasized. MISO
And while the dashboard’s emissions data will be made available on a near-real-time basis at the regional and state level, users have to wait a month after the end of each quarter to look at the hourly data for counties. That’s to avoid revealing operational information about fossil-fueled power plants in those counties to competitors, at least in timeframes that would allow them to act on it in ways that could give them unfair advantages.
Nonetheless, publicly accessible data at the hourly and county level is breaking new ground in the world of grid carbon accounting, Miller said. “
## How states and utilities can use grid-emissions data

Utilities and regulators need hard data to start translating these commonsense understandings of how grids work into real policy decisions with dollars and cents attached to them, Spees said. “

Today, companies can offset emissions associated with their electricity use through clean energy purchases that are averaged out over the course of a year, and which can come from sources far removed from a company’s power-using facilities.
Those loose accounting rules helped enable corporate spending in building more clean energy when solar and wind were rare and expensive, and when linking their generation and delivery to a corporate customer’s actual energy consumption was less important.

Illinois legislators and clean energy advocates have found themselves in a déjà vu moment: working on a package to accelerate their clean energy transition while federal opposition mounts.
The state’s path to climate action began eight years ago with the Future Energy Jobs Act, which devoted millions of dollars to clean energy jobs training, pushed utilities to create energy-efficiency programs, created a community solar program, and drove investment in renewables across the state. President Donald Trump had also just been sworn in for the first time, reinvigorating climate skepticism and renewable energy resistance on the national stage.
Despite the federal challenges, FEJA2021went even further on phasing out fossil fuels. The results have been clear: Illinois had only installed a tiny 80MWFEJA3500MW
That wouldn’t have happened if Illinois waited around for the White House to step up, James Gignac, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, told Canary Media’s Kari Lydersen earlier this year.
““
So now, state lawmakers are working on another pair of bills to make sure things keep rolling, Kari reported this week. They aim to evaluate the state’s current power grid, make it easier to expand the transmission system, and add a ton of new battery storage to make sure the grid can handle a mandated transition to 1002050one of the cleanest grids in the nation thanks to bountiful nuclear power.

California’s cloudy rooftop solar outlook
Rooftop solar is more popular in the Golden State than in any other, but some analysts say the energy source is in part to blame for California’s sky-high utility bills. Industry supporters say this is dead wrong, but two years ago, the state amended its rooftop solar incentives under this logic anyway — a move that caused installations to plummet and is now threatening even the largest solar firms. Sunnova announced this week it could run out of cash within the year. Now, as Canary Media’s Jeff St. John reports, advocates fear deeper cuts are on the way as the debate over rooftop solar rears its head once again. On the other side of the country, similar discourse is threatening Maine’s net energy billing rules, Sarah Shemkus reports.

When utility Duke Energy backed North Carolina legislation four years ago to spur new investments in natural gas and nuclear power, opposition from pulp and paper mills, furniture factories, and other large industrial customers helped tip the political scales and reshape the measure into what ultimately became a landmark bipartisan climate law.
Today, some of the same companies are changing their tune: deriding solar and wind investments, embracing coal and gas, and backing a bill that would unravel the 2021
Testifying before the Senate Agriculture, Energy, and Environment Committee in March, three major industrial associations spoke positively about 2030702005
The bill would also allow the utility to recover power plant development costs from ratepayers before the facilities are producing electricity — a break from the status quo that would encourage Duke to build conventional nuclear plants, which have high upfront costs and long construction timelines.
Kevin Martin, head of the manufacturing and industry trade group Carolina Utility Customers Association, told Canary Media his organization is “SB2612021
Other stakeholders who testified displayed less support for the clean energy transition.

## How the economics of clean energy won over North Carolina’s industrial customers
Although the Trump administration has made a sharp U-turn on Biden-era policies meant to spur clean energy, little about the economics of renewables has changed since the start of the decade.
As of 2024
Such realities, alongside booming power demand, have prompted major industries in North Carolina to welcome renewables alongside more traditional electricity sources.
Duke Energy’s monopoly has also influenced industries’ approach to energy policy. Because they can’t purchase power anywhere else, large customers have relied on regulators to control prices. Big power users have also sought green tariffs — allowing them to buy renewable energy at a premium with Duke acting as a go-between — to help them meet their own sustainability goals.
Those dynamics led major industry groups to join forces with clean energy advocates in 2021 to fight an early draft of a bill that prescribed massive new investments in gas plants and would have charged customers for the utility’s forays into new nuclear power.
Dozens of mills and factories 2021““

By the fall, the bipartisan version of the bill that was signed into law allowed Duke to seek multiyear rate increases, prompting some of the industrial groups to oppose it and others to remain neutral. But none voiced opposition to a 203070

Both businesses and investors value policy certainty, said Mel Mackin, director of state policy at Ceres, the nonprofit advocacy organization that helped draft the letter.
What’s more, she said, “
While President Donald Trump and his backers have made corporate climate targets decidedly less in vogue, Mackin said Ceres’ business members largely remain steadfast.

Though Newton abruptly resigned soon after moving SB261
That means the bill is now in the hands of the Republican-led House twice over.
While the economics of clean energy or corporate climate goals could yet influence the bill’s outcome, advocates also emphasize that incentivizing expensive nuclear and gas projects could leave Duke customers, large and small, in the lurch.
They point to two examples in the region as red flags.

With SMRs, the thinking goes, relatively smaller plants can be plopped down wherever energy is needed in the world, with factory-fabricated components used to cut down on supply chain and construction costs. The designs being developed today aim to do everything from powering merchant ships and off-grid mining operations to supplying baseload power for data centers and producing high-temperature heat for manufacturing.

None of these SMR projects solve the fundamental problem with nuclear power in the US, i.e. high cost. And the anticipated dates for when they'll produce power are almost certainly unrealistic. NuScale failed because local utilities decided the cost of electricity was going to be too high. The same problem exists for the various projects described in this article.

The SMR PowerPoint industry, is just that. There were SMRs built in the U.S. in the 1950s-early 70s. they didn't pan out economically, so the industry upped the size to get an economy of size advantage. These newer SMR designs would get a dis-economy of scale, costing more than the 2 large Vogtle reactors, recently completed. Vogtle will be about 30-33¢/kWh delivered, and these would probably be 40-50¢/kWh delivered. The industry has touted their economy of scale, but never mentions the economy of size. The economy of scale would not kick in if ever, until many units were built. The U.S. and French nuclear industries never experienced a learning curve, but instead kept going up in cost in real dollars. This is an economic bubble in the infant stages.

. . . As the article sub-caption says, ""Nuclear experts say 74 SMR designs are under active development worldwide."" The industry has been saying that SMRs will help nuclear go with standardized designs. With 74 designs, it's going go be a long time before any serious standardization occurs. Learning curves are higher when there is standardization. This does not look like standardization; it looks like a free-for-all to me.

Pretty funny that on the link provided there is a whole section on how it is misleading to directly compare technologies across technologies. Then you proceed to do just that. The proper way to read the chart is to only compare what is in the same box, not between different boxes. Nuclear beats combined cycle in LACE and VCR, both more important metrics.

Some formidable barriers stand in the way, from the Trump administration’s antipathy to clean energy and communities of color, to pockets of local opposition to the large solar farms that have become common across the region.

It appears that the Enfield municipality is up against obtaining adequate funding to upgrade its substation as well as designing and constructing a large community based solar array & battery storage. It may be attractive to find an expert in agrivoltaic systems who can help find private funding to combine sheep herding/perennial grains and PV arrays on private land near the existing substation. Combinations of farming and solar power create highly productive systems that help people with local food and electricity rather than seeing them as competitors for land use.

A home electrification and solar pilot program for lower-income Cape Cod and Martha’s Vineyard residents is cutting participants’ energy bills nearly 60

The program, known as the Cape and Vineyard Electrification Offering, gave solar panels to all 55452024wrapped up in May 2025
The results: The average household is saving some $15059“71
““500
Massachusetts has long had strong incentives for renewable energy and been a leader in policies promoting energy efficiency. The state has had less success, however, in helping lower-income households realize the benefits of these measures. At the same time, Massachusetts residents — especially those who make less money — face some of the highest energy burdens in the country. On Cape Cod, households making less than one-third of the area median income spent an average of 272023
The Cape and Vineyard Electrification Offering was conceived of as a way to overcome the sometimes unmanageable up-front cost of efficiency and clean energy upgrades, and to amplify the impact of individual technologies by deploying them together. Solar panels would keep down the cost of operating heat pumps, and batteries would maximize the amount of zero-cost electricity available to each home.

These figures raised some questions at a recent meeting of the compact’s governing board, at which the Guidehouse report was presented. Downey acknowledged the cost, but pointed out that the need to transition off fossil fuels is inevitable — and comes with a price tag.

The report offers suggestions for improving any future iterations of the initiative. Pilot participants were prohibited from enrolling their solar systems in the state’s net-metering offering, and therefore their compensation for excess energy sent back into the grid was between 51025
The Cape Light Compact will present the results at the August meeting of the state Energy-Efficiency Advisory Council, the group responsible for writing Massachusetts’ triennial energy-efficiency plan.

## California dreamin’
California’s unique geology has made it the destination for the geothermal industry for decades. The Western Hemisphere’s first commercial geothermal power station opened in California in 1960
The state has enormous untapped potential — and a growing need for electricity. California has shut down all but one of its nuclear power plants over the past few decades. In recent years, persistent drought has made the state’s hydroelectric stations less dependable. Solar generation has soared, and a growing fleet of batteries has helped steady the supply when sun-soaked days threaten to overwhelm the grid with electrons and dark nights send panels’ production plummeting. But the state
Burning biomass, such as dry wood cleared from California’s forests to help prevent wildfires, could provide one option — but that still generates carbon dioxide, and the demand for wood might encourage logging of healthy trees. Despite the state’s reversal of its plan to shut down Diablo Canyon, its final atomic station, building new nuclear reactors is still banned in California. Hydropower is dogged by water scarcity. That makes geothermal a particularly attractive choice.
It’s not without some drawbacks. Conventional geothermal, which involves drilling down into underground reservoirs warmed by volcanic heat, is limited to easily accessible areas and comes with the challenge of maintaining the subterranean water source over time. Next-generation geothermal companies are rapidly advancing drilling techniques that the oil and gas industry perfected in recent years to go deeper and harvest heat from dry, hot rocks, vastly expanding the locations with potential to generate energy. In a seismically active state, that carries some risk since the version of next-generation geothermal that uses hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, technology to drill could trigger earthquakes.
But every energy source comes with challenges, and neighboring states such as Utah, Nevada, and New Mexico are aggressively pursuing next-generation geothermal projects.
In theory, the best place to develop those first-of-a-kind plants would be California, with its energy-affordability woes and status as a major global economy.

California needs to diversify it resource portfolio. Solar and batteries have been and will continue to be the favored resources because of their lower costs and multiple options for siting. Proposed offshore wind development is facing headwinds that may take a few years to overcome. The CPUC has expressed a clear need for clean firm energy resources as electrification of the economy accelerates. Geothermal companies will need to reach out to the gubernatorial candidates who are seeking to replace Governor Newsom next year.

No mention of Quaise Energy, the geothermal driller that's using microwave technology to access supercritical heat in Oregon with 10x the energy capacity of conventional depth geothermal wells. And Chevron recently bought a 4 square mile ranch with a year round creek located in the valley below the Geysers steam field in Sonoma County. Trump has kneecapped every renewable resource development except geothermal. Probably because geothermal can be monopolized by BigOil&Gas whenever they're ready, and offshore wind is the biggest immediate threat to existing fossil gas producers.

Californians face steep up-front costs if they want to install solar panels to produce clean power and batteries to back up their homes in outages. A new state program will cover those costs for low-income homeowners, but they still have to pay up to tens of thousands of dollars initially and then wait months for the rebate to come through.
Now a startup called
It’s the latest riff on the evolving market for virtual power plants, which aggregate thousands of small energy systems into a meaningful tool to meet the energy needs of utilities or competitive electricity markets. The grid needs more energy just about everywhere in the U.S., but large-scale infrastructure construction runs into persistent delays and challenges. Adding generation and storage capacity in homes is relatively quick, and with the right incentives, can add up to a substantial tool to meet the grid’s needs.
If Haven successfully implements those incentives, it thinks it will be able to install 10
## Haven’s home-battery strategy
Haven launched in 2023CEO
““
At the same time, utilities have begun grappling with a sudden uptick in electricity demand to supply AI, industry, and electrification. Utilities increasingly recognize the value of fleets of aggregated batteries to help meet peak demand, Campo said, but they’re much more comfortable contracting for large assets than thousands of small ones.
Putting these threads together, Campo decided Haven should own the batteries it installs at customer homes, so it can control them to serve utilities’ grid needs, and pull together different revenue streams to lower the cost for consumers.
““
Now Haven can tap into a new tranche of state funds to make this a reality.
## California earmarks $280
Batteries don’t generate power, but for arcane bureaucratic reasons California has long funded its desired battery expansion with the Self-Generation Incentive Program. This legacy program has shifted with the times, and its newest evolution opened up $280
Technically, those homeowners can apply for the funds themselves. But this is a rebate program, so they would have to front the cost — which can easily tally up to $3000040000SGIP
Haven, though, has raised a debt facility and studied up on the necessary details. It can fund the cost of installation and wait for the rebate without sweating. Then it’s on the hook to make sure the installed battery system meets the program requirements for lowering demand in the evenings over 10
The customer, meanwhile, doesn’t have to pay Haven any money, but benefits from the backup power and from lowering their electricity demand during peak pricing hours. Customers who use the SGIP
Haven has already signed up a few hundred households for this program; the new rebates for solar-battery systems will open up on May 20
““‘‘
## Complex regulations could hinder battery adoption
Customers could be forgiven for not believing this program is real, because up until now, it hasn’t been.
State legislators originally allocated $900SGIP202270SGIP
But instead of quickly establishing the rules and moving the money out the door, the California Public Utilities Commission oversaw a yearslong process of laborious updates to the SGIP
“
While that cumbersome process was underway, the Legislature pared down most of the allocation, leaving just $280
The funds still need to be claimed by June 302026
SGIP-funded batteries already had cycling requirements, meaning they couldn’t just sit in backup mode and not provide more value to the grid, he noted.
Going forward, the batteries have to be enrolled in a “
Other demand response programs include home batteries, like the Demand-Side Grid Support and Emergency Load Reduction programs, but the commission hasn’t approved them for the SGIP
The commission did grant an exemption for customers of municipal utilities who don’t have access to any qualified demand response programs, Buswell-Charkow said. But the regulators denied an exemption to the SGIP
The demand response requirement “
Given those layers of complexity, it’s hard to imagine homeowners wading into the morass themselves. Even local solar installers struggle with the administrative burden of meeting SGIP

A coal fired power plant is far more efficient and produces far more power reliablity over all boutique solutions offered by the green options currently existing. It requires far less land and operates in sun, wind, rain, snow and darkness. As far as economical, remove the Obama era taxes, you'll find it the second lowest per kilowatt power generation option after established nuclear plants. If the playing field was leveled and all government funding from wind and solar projects removed, no one would ever select either as their power solution.

As Mellino sees it, solar in priority areas would avoid objections raised by some people about displacing farmland.

The law also removes a restriction that has required behind-the-meter generation to be located

In other words, multiple businesses could form a shared “
The ability to combine resources means customers wouldn’t necessarily need lots of land to add renewable energy, said Benson. “
The law also reduces the overall tax burden for new electricity production. Local governments may collect less revenue but still welcome the jobs and other spending that come with new energy investments. And less stringent requirements might even benefit some communities when new power generation is sited, Borchers suggested.

Amid rising power bills and surging energy demand, Republicans in Congress are set to undermine the country’s primary source of new electricity — clean energy.
The “passed in May by House Republicans and now being considered by the Senate would rapidly phase out key clean-energy tax credits, casting uncertainty over more than 6002028
To be fair, the 600 figure is based on what’s currently in the interconnection queue, and a good number of those projects won’t get built regardless of the fate of the tax credits. (Projects often drop out of the queue for all kinds of reasons.) But if the bill kneecaps even a fraction of what’s anticipated, it will have serious consequences for the U.S. energy system. For context, 12002023
The current version of the legislation would rapidly phase out federal tax credits that encourage clean energy development. As it stands, developers would be eligible for the tax credit only if their projects begin construction within 602028
That puts the 318GW202920282029
That doesn’t necessarily mean those projects would be cancelled, but it would scramble their economics, which were calculated under an entirely different set of policy assumptions. It’s near certain that some would fall through. Many more would be delayed as developers hash out new financial terms — read: higher power prices that will be passed onto consumers.
A slowdown in clean energy construction is the exact opposite of what the moment demands.

Last summer, utility Duke Energy joined U.S. and state officials to announce with fanfare
Funded jointly by the federal government and Duke, the project highlighted how advanced technology can help solve the problems posed by an aging electric grid: It will include cables better able to withstand extreme weather and modern support structures that can accommodate new sources of power.
“
But advocates and experts say the Lee-Milburnie transmission line in Eastern North Carolina is just the tip of the iceberg. To save consumers money and meet growing energy demand, they believe policymakers should follow other states’ lead and encourage Duke to perform many more grid upgrades like the one unveiled last summer.
Bipartisan legislation that would do just that failed to meet a key deadline last week, but its contents could still end up in another bill before the session ends later this year. Backers of the measure remain hopeful, in part because it would benefit all energy sources, not just renewable ones.
““
## A congested electricity highway
In North Carolina, as across the country, the transmission grid — the network of high-voltage lines designed to transport electrons across long distances — faces a confluence of challenges. For one thing, the grid is old: about 7035
These aging conductors have much less capacity than newer ones, said North Carolina-based Maureen Quinlan, senior officer for energy modernization at The Pew Charitable Trusts. Old lines are also susceptible to failure from normal wear and tear as well as from extreme weather events like hurricanes and heat waves, causing “
““
The resulting grid congestion from existing, interconnected power suppliers is one “1152023
A second challenge for the present is the long line of projects waiting to merge onto the clogged highway that is the transmission grid. In North Carolina and throughout the Southeast, that “
As Duke and other utilities race to build power plants of all kinds to supply large data centers, manufacturing plants, electric vehicles, and more, the queue is poised to lengthen until the road is widened — that is, until the grid’s capacity is expanded.
““
Addressing today’s bottlenecks helps utilities save money to address a hurdle for tomorrow: building brand new highways to bring large sources of energy, such as offshore wind, to population centers, such as the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area known as The Triangle.
That’s why experts are increasingly looking to advanced transmission technologies, which can quickly be added to the existing grid to allow it to carry more power.
““
The technologies include both hardware and software. Carbon composite conductors, for instance, are up to twice as efficient as traditional aluminum cables reinforced with steel, in part because they sag less when overheated. These modern lines are a key reason the Lee-Milburnie upgrade is expected to reduce the length of service interruptions by 10
Through a process called dynamic line rating, utilities can place sensors on lines to assess temperature, wind speed, and other factors, allowing significantly more power to flow under favorable conditions.
Installing advanced hardware is more economical than building new conventional transmission lines because it offers more bang for the buck, doesn’t involve new rights-of-way, and reuses some existing infrastructure. One recent study found that replacing conventional lines with advanced conductors nationwide would “852035
The Lee-Milburnie line, for instance, will allow 1600260
Advanced software technologies are also money-savers. A pair of studies from Quanta Technologies and The Brattle Group shows such software could reduce energy costs nationwide by over $5“
## Filling the policy vacuum
From Arizona to Maine, there’s growing bipartisan interest around the country in filling that void. Just this week, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, signed a bill requiring utilities to report on their advanced transmission efforts.
Advocates made some headway in North Carolina last November, when the state Utilities Commission
Regulators wrote in their decision that they believe that grid-enhancing technologies “
Commissioners ordered that Duke’s next plan, a draft of which is due in September, report on the utility’s progress toward implementing such technologies, including explanations for not proceeding with any grid enhancements it evaluated.
Legislation sponsored by Rep. Kyle Hall, a Stokes County Republican who co-chairs the House Energy and Public Utilities Committee, would set that directive into law.
“
The proposed legislation,
Gavin’s group has long supported energy efficiency, she said, and promoting advanced transmission technologies is a logical next step.
““
Still, HB8148
Duke, which holds significant sway in the Republican-controlled legislature, hasn’t taken a public stand on the legislation.
However, the utility has previously expressed concern about challenges posed by grid-enhancement technologies. During its planning process last year, the company told regulators that such tools could “
Asked recently about Duke’s position, a company spokesperson told Canary Media: “
Official legislative deadlines notwithstanding, North Carolina lawmakers often combine an array of energy policies into one grand compromise bill; that’s how they passed the state’s bipartisan climate law in 2021

In July, China
The United States, meanwhile, is yanking funding for some of its most ambitious clean-hydrogen projects.
Last week, as part of a list of 32175rescinded $22 in awards to two of the seven regional hydrogen hubs established under the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Unlike the five other hubs, the law designed the terminated projects, in California and the Pacific Northwest, to focus exclusively on hydrogen made with renewable electricity, making them an easy target as the Trump administration slashes Biden-era clean energy projects.
Now this week a second Energy Department list shared with Canary Media indicates the agency is considering whether to pull funding from all seven hydrogen hubs, including those in Texas, Appalachia, and the mid-Atlantic and two in the Midwest.
It’s not certain whether the entire $24carbon-removal firms, have yet to receive notice of cancellation. While federal officials gave companies involved in the West Coast hubs a warning before announcing the cuts last week, three separate producers involved in the other five hubs had not heard from the administration as of Thursday, according to California Hydrogen Business Council CEO
But already, the potential cuts are sowing doubt within the emerging sector — and in the clean energy space more broadly.

Already, key Republican lawmakers have expressed concern.

The uncertainty only adds to the challenges facing the hydrogen industry.
The Biden administration created a two-pronged hydrogen strategy via the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act. The IRA45, was meant to help spur supply of the fuel. The policy survived the rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed in July, but Republicans shortened the timeline for the write-offs from 10
The hydrogen hubs, meanwhile, were meant to coordinate producers and offtakers to create regional ecosystems that could someday be interconnected with pipelines and other infrastructure. Even before the cuts, however, the hubs were struggling to generate enough demand.

Whether states can deliver a green hydrogen industry at scale, however, remains to be seen — and removing billions in federal funding certainly doesn’t make the task easier.

In Puerto Rico, Vermont, California, Texas, and other states, virtual power plants have helped the grid survive spikes in demand, avoiding outages or the need to fire up gas-fueled peaker plants, and saving consumers money.
Illinois is among the areas expecting electricity demand to grow rapidly because of new data centers; meanwhile, the state is mandated to phase out fossil-fuel generation by 2045, and residential and commercial solar have boomed thanks to state incentive programs. If those solar arrays were paired with batteries, they could provide crucial clean power to the grid during high demand.

The bill’s plan would offer a rebate to customers who purchase a battery, if they agree to let the battery be tapped for several hours a day during the summer months, when air conditioners drive up electricity use.
The Illinois proposal is less nuanced and comprehensive than VPPsubsidizes the purchase of batteries, which the utility can then tap while also controlling customers’ smart thermostats, EV
But stakeholders in the solar and energy storage industry say Illinois’ proposal is an important first step, opening the door for more ambitious VPP

## Building momentum
Energy players in Illinois have been talking seriously about VPPs for several years, during negotiations over what has now become HB4120procurement by the state power agency. VPPs, meanwhile, would provide a decentralized form of storage.

Illinois residents already receive a rebate for the same amount when they purchase a battery, but with the new rules, consumers would need to participate in the VPP

The basic program would not help with peak demand during unscheduled times — like unexpectedly hot fall weather. But at least utilities would be guaranteed power during the scheduled peaks, said Heart.

Illinois, like many states, has demand-response programs that are often considered part of virtual power plants, helping people reduce their energy use during peak demand. And ComEd has already proposed a VPP

Proposed legislation in North Carolina that would allow utility Duke Energy to charge customers for power plants still under construction is taking heat from opponents across the political spectrum, in part because similar schemes have left residents in neighboring states holding the bag for pricey abandoned nuclear projects.

## How North Carolina pays for power plants today
A basic tenet of the utility regulatory compact is that shareholders bear the risk and cost of power plant construction. In exchange, these investors are guaranteed a customer base that repays them, plus profit, once facilities are producing electricity.
This dynamic has long disfavored nuclear power, with its protracted construction timelines, astronomical costs, and episodic concerns about safety. Especially since the fracking boom began some two decades ago, Wall Street has judged natural gas the better bet.
This century, 16
Vogtle was made possible partly by policymakers who scrambled the regulatory compact, allowing investors to recoup their outlays as the plant was under construction and to shift the burden of cost overruns to consumers. Thanks to similar policies in other states, the Southeast is dotted with examples of

By contrast, SB26112““
## Legislation could harm state’s nuclear energy aspirations
Duke has no plans for a large, Vogtle-style nuclear reactor right now, and the earliest it envisions bringing a small modular reactor online is in 2035

(David Becker for the Washington Post)
Two years after slashing compensation for rooftop solar owners who send power back to the grid, California policymakers are once again looking for ways to contain high and rising electricity rates — which means the accusation that rooftop solar pushes costs onto other utility customers is once again rearing its head.
Last month, representatives of the California Public Utilities Commission
That testimony is backed by a CPUCCPUChomes, businesses, farms, and schools in the past two years.
The CPUCCPUC&&852024
Solar advocates and environmental justice groups have long said this “2006
Last week, several pro-solar groups research released last year by energy and environmental consulting firm
The latest round in the “CPUC2022 to cut compensation for newly installed rooftop solar systems has decimated the country’s leading rooftop solar market, potentially putting the state’s carbon-cutting goals out of reach. About 45CPUCwent into effect in mid-2023.
Without more rooftop solar, ““
But the cost-shift argument has short-circuited that kind of policy discussion, said Brad Heavner, policy director for the California Solar and Storage Association, a solar-industry trade group that funded M.Cubed’s cost-shift analyses. “
Now, with mounting pressure to reduce utility rates, rooftop solar advocates fear the argument will be used once again to justify further cuts to an industry they view as crucial not only to climate goals but as a net benefit — not cost — to utility customers.
## What’s the cost shift?
The cost-shift argument was initially put forward
But Richard McCann, a founding partner at M.Cubed, argues that California’s 152024
Back in 20054560GW2022
But peak electricity demand on the statewide grid operated by the California Independent System Operator (CAISOrecord-setting peak of 52GW2022 — only about 2GW2006
Over that same time, the state’s net-metering policies have incentivized millions of customers of the state’s three big utilities to install solar panels, he said. Much of the state’s peak grid demand coincides with hot summer afternoons — the same time that rooftop solar produces the most electricity.
CAISO“CAISOCAISO
If that’s the case, customers investing in rooftop solar have helped the state’s utilities avoid investing in new generation, transmission, and distribution, potentially saving ratepayers billions of dollars, he said. “
## Who owns the solar power used at home?
McCann’s view, supported by some energy analysts, is hotly contested by utilities as well as
In the latter group’s view, rooftop solar is a more expensive and less efficient alternative to building utility-scale solar power plants and transmission grids. Shifting money from those larger-scale alternatives not only pulls money from customers without solar to those with solar, they argue, but represents a lost opportunity for utilities to invest in more cost-effective clean power.
Severin Borenstein, head of the Energy Institute at the University of California, Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, is a key proponent of the cost-shift theory. In January, “
Borenstein said that a proper analysis finds that in 2024485CPUC
In February, McCann published a 20
That uncertainty has led both sides to accuse the other of using intentionally misleading data and methods. McCann acknowledged that his initial analysis last year miscalculated the benefits that he believes rooftop solar has delivered to customers of the state’s three big utilities. He originally calculated $23202415
The in-the-weeds exchange between McCann and Borenstein reveals a deeper disagreement at the heart of their vastly different estimates — one that cost-shift foes say California regulators have failed to fully acknowledge. It centers on a simple question: When a household generates solar power at the same time as it’s using electricity from the grid, who owns that solar?
According to McCann, who cited legal precedents and the fundamental physics that determine the flow of electrons, solar power that customers generate and consume at their own homes and buildings is theirs by right. They paid for the solar systems, and they’re directly using the electricity those systems generate.
But according to both Borenstein and the Public Advocates Office’s analysis, solar power simultaneously generated at the time that power is being consumed on site should be considered as a cost to other utility customers.
As Borenstein states in his January rebuttal, “‘
In other words, according to this logic, allowing solar-equipped customers to count the power they generate as offsetting their use of grid power undermines the fundamental structure of utility rates, which recover the costs of electricity delivery by charging customers for their hour-by-hour energy use.
These two different interpretations go a long way in explaining the chasm between McCann’s analysis and those from Borenstein and the Public Advocates Office. According to McCann’s analysis, this category of “485
But McCann believes that Borenstein and the Public Advocates Office’s perspective runs afoul of standing legal and regulatory precedent on such matters.
He cited a 2015CPUCUC
FERC
The bigger problem with the cost-shift numbers from CPUCCPUC20002002
Instead, the Public Advocates Office published a
“CPUC
Then, the CPUC“
## Differentiating rooftop solar’s past from its future
It’s important to note that these cost-shift analyses are looking at California’s rooftop solar past, not its future. In more recent years, as solar has grown to make up an increasing portion of California’s electricity-generation mix, peak grid demands have shifted from late afternoons when the sun is still shining to hot evenings after the sun goes down. Every new increment of solar power added to the grid is less and less useful on its own in reducing these
Batteries that store power for use during these post-sundown peaks have thus become a vital addition to new solar installations, both at the utility scale and at homes and businesses.
The net-billing tariff the CPUC2022rewards customers who add batteries that can store and inject power during those valuable hours — a service that should reduce how much energy utilities need to secure and how much grid infrastructure they need to build to serve those peak moments.
But solar advocates are now worried that the CPUC“
Under the CPUC20CPUC
The CPUC“

Nice article Jeff, objectively written!
This basic argument hasn't changed in 15 years. Utilities still do whatever they can to impede disruption of their legacy business models. From a consumer advocacy perspective, we must reduce costs and/or increase cost-performance to the point where a customer's economics make sense without subsidies. It may seem like we're a long way off from that, but look at how far we've come. Community solar can be a solution for customers whose roofs or finances prevent them from investing in their own solar system.

The only true effect residential roof-top and or community solar has on the Grid (The Utility Companies) is their BUDGET. They do not want to see any external influences affecting their profits. They agree Community Solar is a Great Benefit yet they fight smaller companies and groups in the development of it until they themselves have built out mega solar farms which increase their profit margins exponentially with very little overhead aside from initial cost to build. Rates continue to go up yet they have failed to reinvest profits or more accurately establish an efficient line item in their budget for maintenance and upgrades which is often used as the reason for increased rates to consumers.

The announcement follows a series of setbacks for foreign offshore wind developers that were once seen as essential to fulfilling the decarbonization goals set by the U.S. government and many Northeastern states.
In January, the U.K.’s Shell exited the now-defunct Atlantic Shores wind project slated for the waters near New Jersey, and failed — to cancel.
Though intensified by the current administration, the industry’s financial troubles began even before Trump took office. One year ago, Ørsted 70412
“
Denmark, which owns half of Ørsted, is backing the new fundraising effort in which the company will issue new shares worth about 459242027
Selling off a stake of Sunrise Wind was always part of the plan; the proceeds were meant to cover a large chunk of its construction. Now that would-be buyers are avoiding Trump’s chaos, Ørsted is left footing the entire bill. The firm’s other active U.S. project, Revolution Wind, is 802026
But despite assurances that both Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind will be finished, even at a steep cost to the firm, Ørsted — according to Wilson — is unlikely to invest in American offshore wind again. Ørsted did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.
“
Trump issued an executive order on Inauguration Day that froze all offshore wind permitting and leasing pending a federal review. Seemingly safe at the time were eight projects, including Ørsted’s Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind, that already had all their federal permits in hand. Of those fully permitted projects, the 28 off the New Jersey coast has since fallen apart. Two more are likely to be mothballed — MarWin near Maryland and New England Wind off the Massachusetts coastline — since they probably won’t qualify for the wind-energy tax credits that Trump’s July megabill sent to an early grave.
Trump did not kickstart the sector’s problems — he simply poured gasoline on the fire.

You say that but do you know why the industry is the way it is now? Its because we subsidize the hell out of oil and gas. The biden tax break for wind was just to give it a chance to go to market. Unlike oil and gas, after it is operating., electricity generated by offshore wind is free.

The Ohio Chamber of Commerce is emerging as an unexpected ally of clean-energy advocates and solar developers who are hoping to build more projects in the state.
While the business group continues to oppose clean-energy mandates and still supports natural-gas expansion, it has become more vocal in recent years in supporting utility-scale solar projects.

Building dirty power plants to serve the AI

This is the third article in our four-part series ​“ _Boon or bane: What will data centers do to the grid?” _
The world’s wealthiest tech companies want to build giant data centers across the United States to feed their AI1
If built, these data centers would unleash a torrent of demand for electricity on the country’s power grids. Utilities, regulators, and policymakers are scrambling to keep pace. If they mismanage their response, it could lead to higher utility bills for customers and far more carbon emissions. But this mad dash for power could also push the U.S. toward a cleaner and cheaper grid — if tech giants and other data center developers decide to treat the looming power crunch as a clean-power opportunity.
Utilities from Virginia to Texas are planning to build large numbers of new fossil-gas-fired power plants and to extend the life of coal plants. To justify this, they point to staggering — but dubious — forecasts of how much electricity data centers will gobble up in the coming years, mostly to power the AI
Most of the tech giants in question have set ambitious clean energy goals. They’ve also built and procured more clean power than any other corporations in the country, and they’re active investors in or partners of startups working on next-generation carbon-free energy sources like advanced geothermal.
But some climate activists and energy analysts believe that given the current frenzy to build AI
It’s time, these critics say, for everyone involved — tech giants, utilities, regulators, and policymakers — to “
“AI
Williams isn’t alone. Climate activists, energy analysts, and policymakers in states with fast-growing data center markets fear that data center developers are prioritizing expediency over solving cost and climate challenges.
““
Some tech firms intend to rely on unproven technologies like small modular nuclear reactors to build emissions-free data centers, an approach that analysts say is needlessly unreliable. Others want to divert electricity from existing nuclear plants — as Amazon hopes to do in Pennsylvania — which simply shifts clean power from utility grids to tech companies. Yet others are simply embracing new gas construction as the best path forward for now, albeit with promises to use cleaner energy down the road, as
Meanwhile, several fossil fuel companies are hoping to convince tech firms and data center developers to largely avoid the power grid by building fossil-gas-fired plants that
But a number of tech firms and independent data center developers are pursuing more realistic strategies that are both affordable and clean in order to meet their climate goals.
These projects should be the model, clean power advocates say, if we want to ensure the predicted AI-fueled boom in energy demand doesn’t hurt utility customers or climate goals.
And ideally, the companies involved would go even further, Williams said, by engaging in utility proceedings to demand a clean energy transition, by bringing their own grid-friendly “
## Getting utilities and data centers on the same page
The basic mandate of utilities is to provide reliable and affordable energy to all customers. Many utilities also have mandates — issued by either their own executives or state policymakers — to build clean energy and cut carbon emissions.
But the scale and urgency of the data center boom has put these priorities on a collision course.
As the primary drivers of that conflict, data centers have a responsibility to help out. That’s Brian Janous’ philosophy. He’s the cofounder of 25

Similar developer partnerships between utilities and data centers are popping up nationwide.
In Georgia, the Clean Energy Buyers Association and utility Georgia Power are negotiating to give tech companies more freedom to contract for clean energy supplies. In North Carolina, tariffs for long-duration energy storage, modular nuclear reactors, and other “NVadvanced geothermal plant that Fervo Energy is planning.
““
Insulating utility customers from bearing the costs of data center power demand is a core feature of these tariffs. Broader concerns over the costs that unchecked data center growth could impose have triggered pushback from communities, politicians, and regulators in data center hot spots. But Janous highlighted that Cloverleaf’s Wisconsin project will have “100

## Bringing the data centers to where the clean power can be built
But cost is not the primary barrier to building clean power today.
In fact, portfolios of new solar, wind, and batteries are cheaper than new gas-fired power plants in most of the country. Instead, the core barrier to getting clean power online — be it for data centers or other large-scale power buyers, or even just for utilities — is the limited capacity of the power grid itself.
Across much of the U.S., hundreds of gigawatts of solar, wind, and battery projects are held up in yearslong waitlists to get interconnected to congested transmission grids. Facing this situation, some data center developers are targeting parts of the country where they can build their own clean power and avoid as much of the grid logjam as possible.
In November, for example, Google, infrastructure investor TPGunveiled a plan to invest $202030 into clusters of wind, solar, and batteries that are largely dedicated to powering newly built data centers.
With the right balance of wind, solar, and batteries, topped off by power from the connecting grid or from on-site fossil-gas generators, Intersect Power CEO“80
And importantly, that clean energy is ““
Think tank Energy Innovation has cited this “
And while many existing data center hubs aren’t well suited to energy parks, plenty of other places around the country are, said Gary Dorris, CEO““100
That’s not to say that building these energy parks will be simple. First, there’s the sheer amount of land required. A gigawatt-scale data center may occupy a “500010000
And then there are the regulatory hurdles involved. Almost all U.S. utilities hold exclusive rights to provide power and build power-delivery infrastructure within the territories they serve. The exception is Texas, which has a uniquely competitive energy regulatory regime. Intersect Power plans to build its first energy park with Google and TPG
Cloverleaf’s Janous highlighted this and other constraints to the energy-park concept.
Getting the workforce to build large-scale projects in remote areas is another challenge, he added, as is accessing the fiber-optic data pipelines needed by data centers serving time- and bandwidth-sensitive tasks.
“
On the other hand, the task of training AI“
““AI
## Why relying on fossil gas doesn’t make economic sense
The Sierra Club and other climate advocates would prefer data center demand is met with no new fossil-fuel power at all. But few, if any, industry analysts think that is realistic. So, the question becomes how much
A growing number of companies are targeting data centers as potential new customers for gas-fired power, including oil and gas majors. ExxonMobil announced plans to 1GE“
President Donald Trump has also backed this idea of building fossil-fuel power plants for data centers. ““
The federal government doesn’t regulate utilities and power plants, however — states do. And even if that weren’t the case, Janous and Intersect Power’s Kimber agreed that building utility-scale gas power plants solely for data centers is a nonstarter. ““
Kimber said that Intersect Power’s energy-parks concept does include gas-fueled generators. But they’ll be relatively cheap, allowing them to earn their keep even if run infrequently to fill the gaps at times when solar, wind, and batteries can’t supply power. Eventually they can be replaced with next-generation storage technologies.
That’s quite different from building a utility-scale power plant that must run most of the time for decades to pay back its cost, he said. “
Nor can large-scale gas power plants be built quickly enough to match the pace that developers have set for themselves to get data centers up and running. GE
Utility holding company and major clean energy developer NextEra Energy announced last month that it was GECEO“2030““
Marathon Capital’s Kania agreed with this assessment. ““

Speaking to fossil fuel executives and other energy leaders at the CERAWeek conference last week, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright made a bold claim.
“
But that claim is​“not borne out by the data at all,” Robbie Orvis, the senior director of modeling and analysis for nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation, told Canary Media’s Jeff St. John. In fact, a report out Thursday from Orvis and his colleagues found that clean energy is key to keeping U.S. electric bills in check.
The analysis looks at what would happen if congressional Republicans succeed in repealing the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits that have helped supercharge clean energy adoption in the U.S. The result of such a repeal? Dirtier air, more carbon emissions — and higher power bills. The average household’s energy bills would rise $482030682035
The reason bills would rise is straightforward: Cutting IRA
Aside from electricity cost, clean energy boasts several other economic advantages over fossil fuels. A 2023Energy Innovation report found that 992023drastically reduces particulate matter and other air pollutants, which in turn helps people avoid health care costs.

(Boston Metal)
Massachusetts-based Boston Metal is on the verge of earning its first revenue as it continues honing a novel steelmaking process so clean it can vent emissions into a parking lot the company shares with a day care center.
“
The technique, which was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is now being scaled up for commercialization, uses electricity to remove contaminants from iron ore, producing a small fraction of the emissions generated by traditional fossil fuel–fired blast furnaces. Indeed, the technology releases no carbon dioxide — just oxygen — and the only greenhouse gas emissions are those associated with the electricity used to power the system.
Promoting green steel was a major element of former President Joe Biden’s economic and environmental agenda. However, the Trump administration’s desire to boost fossil fuels has already undermined these efforts and left the future of the sector in question.
Against that backdrop, Boston Metal, with its carefully calibrated business plan and lack of dependence on increasingly unreliable federal funding, seems to have unusually bright prospects.
The company was founded in 2013400range of backers including global steel giant ArcelorMittal, the venture-capital arm of oil company Saudi Aramco, global investment manager M&
The possible payoff is significant: Demand for low-emissions steel is expected to increase by at least 672030RMI
““
## A novel way to refine iron ore
The task of greening steel production is daunting. Globally, nearly 192
Roughly 90contributing to high pollution levels in the cities where they are located.
Another process, known as direct reduction of iron, or DRIDRIDRI
“
Boston Metal sidesteps that complication by refining iron through a process called molten oxide electrolysis. Iron ore is poured into a brick-lined chamber, where it dissolves in an electrolyte solution. An electric current runs through the liquid, melting the ore. Contaminants in the ore — like alumina, silica, and calcia — are left behind in the solution, while the molten purified metal settles to the bottom of the chamber.
When enough iron has accumulated, the chamber is tapped, in a sort of fiery, industrial analog to tapping a maple tree for sap. A meter-long bit drills into the cell, allowing the molten iron to flow out. Then the hole is plugged with a ceramic clay until the next tapping.
Though the equipment runs constantly at a temperature of about 1600
The electricity powering the process runs from an anode at the top of the chamber to the molten metal, which acts as a cathode. The anode is one of Boston Metal’s major technological innovations. For the equipment to produce significant quantities of molten iron, the anode must be made of a material that can resist corrosion in the oxygen-rich environment. MIT
The anode “
The first trial runs in the MIT138000
Several midsize systems also run in the facility as does one full-scale cell that can produce roughly a ton of purified iron per month using 10
## Commercializing molten oxide electrolysis
As Boston Metal continues to refine its system, it is also trying to work its way toward profitability. To get there, company leaders have decided on a strategy that, perhaps unexpectedly, puts steel on the back burner for the moment.
The key is niobium, a metal that is valuable as an alloying element in steel production and that can be extracted from other materials using molten oxide electrolysis. Niobium sells for about $8274000900
In 2023
“
This graduated approach gives the company some stability at a time when the future of green steel in the U.S. is anything but certain.
Last year, the Biden administration awarded $500 to two projects aiming to make low-emissions steel using hydrogen for DRI“10
Boston Metal, however, is somewhat insulated from these headwinds. While Trump’s funding moves have created economic uncertainty, the company is not directly supported by any federal grants, though it has received some federal support in the past. The company is waiting to hear the fate of a $50
Boston Metal plans to build a demonstration plant for steel production by 2028
Producers using Boston Metal’s technology are likely to seek out locations with a clean, low-priced electric supply to maximize the economic and environmental advantages, he said.
Boston Metal’s technology and that of other companies exploring the use of electricity hold a lot of promise, but plenty of questions and hurdles remain, Ramirez said.

The Trump administration’s on-again, off-again federal funding pause has local governments, clean energy manufacturers and project developers, and climate nonprofits struggling to make sense of it all.
President Trump kicked off his time in the White House with a series of executive orders that paused the disbursement of Inflation Reduction Act and bipartisan infrastructure law funding, affecting everything from electric vehicle chargers to
But as Canary Media’s Jeff St. John reported Monday, the court orders haven’t necessarily made funds start flowing again — nor have they made the groups relying on federal climate and clean energy funding feel much better. Many recipients have already started spending money or building long-term plans around those grants because Congress was legally committed to paying them out. Now, it’s unclear whether the federal government will actually follow through and hand out obligated funding.
That’s creating a big problem for groups like Zero Emissions Northwest, which had been awarded $37USDA

A pesky question has long stalled efforts to expand U.S. power grids in the face of growing demand and surging renewable energy: Who should pay for the upgrades?
An under-the-radar breakthrough in Massachusetts may finally provide a template for answering that question.
Over the past year or so, the state’s largest utilities and regulators have
It’s been a long time coming. The plans in question have gone through numerous iterations since utilities, regulators, and solar developers started working on them about six years ago, making progress hard to track. And the name they settled on — “
But behind the staid name lies a significant advance for a state striving to fairly allocate the costs of shifting to clean energy, said Kate Tohme, director of interconnection policy at Massachusetts-based community solar developer New Leaf Energy. In fact, advocates working on similar efforts in states from New York to California are “
The roughly $334CIP
That doesn’t mean developers are getting a free ride, however. They’ll still have to pay a portion of those costs back as they’re connected to the grid, reducing the burden on customers over time. And every project in question had to prove to regulators that the grid improvements at large also deliver customer benefits, whether through improved grid reliability, enabling access to cheaper community solar power, or both.
Massachusetts can’t avoid these kinds of grid investments if it’s to meet its clean energy and electrification goals, according to Tohme, a former official at the state Department of Public Utilities who was directly involved in some of the earliest CIP5019902030
““
## Sharing costs to solve the solar logjam
The landmark plan emerged as a response to what might be seen as a clean-energy success story — Massachusetts had too much community solar trying to get onto an overly crowded grid.
The launch of the 2018
““
National Grid was encountering the same kind of interconnection backlog and upgrade cost challenges that have tied up utility-scale solar and wind projects on high-voltage transmission grids across the country. The main difference is that community solar projects connect to lower-voltage grids that carry power from big substations to end customers. Similar backlogs have dogged other states with lots of Minnesota and
One of the best-established ways to relieve interconnection stresses is for utilities and grid operators to stop painstakingly studying each project one at a time and batch them instead.
It also allows grid-upgrade costs to be shared among the projects in the cluster, rather than foisting them on whichever project engineers determined would push that part of the grid over its existing capacity limit, thus triggering an upgrade, Porcaro said.
But the approach has its limits. “
To deal with that disconnect, “2021
National Grid and other utilities already plan ahead to accommodate growing electricity demand from customers or to serve big new developments like housing subdivisions or factories, Porcaro noted. The goal of the provisional system planning approach was to find a way to similarly pay in advance for proactive grid investments to bring community solar projects online.
““
## Figuring out a fair share
In late 2022“
Eversource estimated at the time that it would cost about $116140370
The risk of this approach is that some of the projects involved in the group study would end up dropping out, leaving customers on the hook for their unpaid share, Lavelle Freeman, Eversource’s vice president of distribution system planning, told Canary Media in a 2023
Fortunately, the same kinds of upgrades that expand capacity for community solar also improve customer reliability and provide headroom for growing electrical loads.
“**“** We developed a very rigorous algorithm to calculate the reliability benefits,” which ended up showing a roughly 5050“
To be clear, there are significant risks to committing utility customers’ money to building out grid infrastructure to serve the needs of community solar projects. In Massachusetts, the state Attorney General’s Office is tasked with protecting utility customers’ interests in regulatory proceedings like these.
A senior official at the Attorney General’s Office who was involved with the CIP““
On the other hand, the official said, “
These concerns from the Attorney General’s Office pushed the finalized version of CIP
Having a known per-kilowatt cost locked in well in advance is also helpful, said Mike Judge, currently undersecretary of energy for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, who spoke to Canary Media in 2023
Developers often need to secure interconnection rights before they can secure the financing and start signing up rs that allow them to move forward with projects, he said.
“370“5
## From reactive to proactive
The model that Eversource established for the Marion-Fairhaven project is largely mirrored in the 10300MW“
Massachusetts isn’t the only state working on policies that aim to spur grid expansion while keeping customers’ power costs in check, Tohme said.
But to Tohme’s knowledge, no other state has accomplished what Massachusetts has with its CIP“
At the same time, Tohme pointed out, the CIPs remain a response to a problem that’s been hounding the state for years now: projects stuck behind an inadequately upgraded grid. The next logical step is to figure out where grid upgrades should be made before
That’s one of the goals laid out for the state’s three major investor-owned utilities under a sprawling grid-modernization mandate created as part of a major energy and climate law passed in 2022
CIPs are a part of that broader plan, he said. But the modernization plans are “‘EV
Given how long it took to figure out CIPs, clean energy developers have reason to worry that this even more sweeping and complicated planning task could take even longer. Clean-energy industry group Advanced Energy United has
Porcaro highlighted other work that can help get more clean energy connected even before the grid gets built out. He pointed to National Grid’s
These kinds of “, as they’re generally known, could help “
Meanwhile, the clock is ticking on building out a grid that can support Massachusetts’ clean energy and electrification ambitions. Later this year, the Department of Public Utilities is expected to issue its ground rules on how utilities should start to calculate the fair sharing of costs between their customers and the community solar and battery projects trying to connect to their grids under the Electric Sector Modernization Plans, Tohme said.
Once that’s done, utilities and other stakeholder groups will bring cost-sharing proposals to the regulator and start to hash them out, she said. ”
But just because it’s going to be hard doesn’t mean it isn’t worth doing, she said. “

A report by Grid Strategies, commissioned by environmental groups, estimates that maintaining these plants through DOE emergency powers could cost utility customers nearly $6 billion through 2028, without providing any grid reliability benefits.

When Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, first nominated Marissa Gillett to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority in 2019“
Public utility commissions are essential but largely invisible forces regulating and shaping electricity, gas, and water services at the state level. Traditionally, these boards have been thought of as working in tandem with utilities, rarely challenging their proposals and claims. Recently, though, the tides have shifted, as more states and advocacy groups look at ways for commissioners to advance state energy policy.
The need for decisive action from utility commissions is becoming more acute as electricity prices climb almost everywhere in the country and many states push to meet decarbonization goals. The regulatory status quo just doesn’t lend itself to the systemic changes needed to fight these battles.
Gillett has been hailed by some as an exemplar of the assertive regulator, bringing a decidedly proactive sensibility to her work on the Connecticut commission, commonly called PURA
“
## Moving beyond ​‘
The traditional model for investor-owned utilities guarantees them a set rate of return on every dollar spent building new distribution lines, upgrading substations, and other such projects. This dynamic has led to criticism that utilities are prone to overspending on infrastructure that might not be in the interest of customers or the environment, for the simple reason that it will bolster their earnings and please their investors.
A key job of leaders like Gillett is to weigh these utility requests against the need for adequate, reliable infrastructure, and the needs of consumers and the state’s energy policy goals. But for too long, critics say, commissioners have functioned more as umpires calling balls and the occasional strike, approving most utility requests.
Before coming to Connecticut, Gillett worked for seven years at the Maryland Public Service Commission, contributing to the development of initiatives including the state’s electric vehicle programs and its offshore wind plan. After a brief stint with the Energy Storage Association, a trade group, she threw her hat in the ring for the Connecticut commissioner position.

It’s difficult to assess the effect of Gillett’s philosophy on Connecticut’s energy and climate landscape quite yet: Changes to the utility industry are notoriously slow-moving, and the pandemic added an extra level of disruption to her tenure.

LOVELAND
I was standing inside the cavernous facility where the startup 83000
The grapefruit-sized component I grasped, called a compressor wheel, helps to produce the heat that’s needed to make steam with AtmosZero’s tech, Todd Bandhauer, the startup’s chief technology officer and cofounder, explained from the factory floor.
AtmosZero opened the facility, once a mothballed Hewlett-Packard electronics plant, earlier this year to begin commercial production of its Boiler 20
The company has big ambitions for its electrified solution. In the United States, around 40
“CEO“
AtmosZero spun out of Bandhauer’s research at Colorado State University in 202130326502026

The factory floor was quiet when I visited last month, with custom-made parts in open boxes or on pallets awaiting assembly. But Stark said he sees the facility getting much busier as the company works to fill demand from potential buyers, who face increasing pressure from state regulators and their own customers to slash gas-related pollution.
““
## A cleaner way to make steam
Industrial heat accounts for about 100
Heat pumps, by contrast, move heat instead of making it. The appliances use electricity and a refrigerant to gather thermal energy from someplace else — say, the open air or a water pipe — and concentrate it using a compressor to deliver the heat where it’s needed. This process can be 300400
AtmosZero and a handful of other manufacturers are developing new heat pumps that will allow the technology to replace an even larger share of gas-fired boilers in factories.
Existing heat-pump models can churn out heat up to about 16032044ACEEE20039255
“
At the AtmosZero factory, Bandhauer broke down how the Boiler 20
The compressor wheel I held had precisely sculpted blades that swept out in a tight spiral. When secured in the heat pump, a motor spins the wheel at up to 30000
Then, voila: You have steam as hot as 165329
!Schematic of the inner workings of AtmosZero's steam heat pump, showing two cycles of heat transfer The two compression cycles of AtmosZero’s heat pump drive its ability to produce steam. (AtmosZero)
Still, for all the apparent benefits, industrial heat pumps on the market today have struggled to gain widespread adoption. To start, they’re more expensive to install than gas boilers, which can last for decades — limiting the business case for replacing them. In the United States, fossil gas has historically been cheap enough in many places that a boiler has cost less to run than a heat pump, even though the latter uses a fraction of the energy.
States like adopting policies to help address these hurdles. That includes incentives for manufacturers to invest in tech that slashes emissions, air-quality regulations that limit pollution from their operations, and
Despite the technology’s high price tag, heat pumps can deliver significant savings on factory owners’ utility bills, according to ACEEE
“
## AtmosZero’s modular approach
AtmosZero isn’t the only company making steam-producing heat pumps. Other manufacturers — including GEA
These systems often supplement existing fossil-fueled boilers by capturing a plant’s excess heat that would otherwise be wasted. That approach helps maximize a heat pump’s efficiency: Since the waste heat is already toasty, it’s easier for the tech to turn that into even higher-temperature heat for making steam.
Customers often want to actively harness this throwaway warmth to keep electric bills as low as possible, Checknoff said. But because every facility is different, installing a heat pump to slurp up that thermal energy can be costly and cumbersome.
AtmosZero is aiming for economies of scale, similar to how solar panels and home heat pumps are mass-manufactured and deployed in a modular way. “
The startup’s heat pump can be installed in a day, requiring only hookups to electricity and water lines and the factory’s control system. It’s as simple as replacing an old gas boiler with a new one, he said. And at New Belgium’s brewery, putting in the pilot heat pump this spring didn’t disrupt operations.
“
!Graphic of different configurations for installing an AtmosZero heat pump and making steam sans carbon emissions AtmosZero’s electric heat pump can be installed in a variety of configurations to produce steam (red) using thermal energy harvested from outdoor air. (AtmosZero)
AtmosZero’s product does have a key trade-off: It’s not as efficient as heat pumps that competitors install to harness waste heat. Those systems produce more heat with the same amount of energy. That ability is measured with what’s called the coefficient of performance, or COPCOPCOP
But the Boiler 20
## Building a better heat pump
At his desk inside the AtmosZero factory, a young engineer named Mason Mollenhauer pulled up on his computer screen a rendering of the 65030
New Belgium, the famed maker of Fat Tire Ale, is using the steam to boil wort, a sugary liquid, with bitter hops to create the libation’s flavor and aroma profile before it’s fermented into beer. When running at full capacity, AtmosZero’s heat pump is able to provide about 3040
The AtmosZero team has been carefully monitoring the New Belgium installation’s performance since June, and they’ve been able to apply lessons from the pilot project to improve their product, Bandhauer said.
While AtmosZero’s first heat-pump unit was stuffed with equipment, the latest version is roomier. The streamlined model has fewer parts, reducing costs and making it easier to service, Bandhauer said. The team is also finessing the design of its crucial compressor wheels.

Michaela Eagan, a spokesperson for New Belgium, said the brewer is focused on evaluating how the heat pump performs and hasn’t committed to any future orders.
But AtmosZero is in talks with dozens of other potential customers and is anticipating demand through 2027201202402030
So far, the company has primarily targeted factories for its product. But AtmosZero is also branching out into steam for other big buildings. In September, New York

My Guess is that burning gas and doing full carbon capture and sequestration might actually be cheaper and greener unless the fraction of recovered heat is fairly large. Without that data it is hard to judge the merits.

Carbon capture and sequestration is not likely to be viable any time soon for small facilities, and maybe ever. Less than 1 million tons CO2/yr is a no go in terms of cost in any current scenario, and this facility would be well below that output.

It wasn’t clear just how long it would take to navigate multiple layers of permitting for a never-before-seen aquatic power generator. The startup needed permission from the Army Corps of Engineers, which governs the navigable waterways of the United States, as well as sign-off from the Port and other local and state authorities. Securing all those approvals ended up taking about two years, after which Eco Wave Power installed and commissioned the site in just four months, Braverman said.
But she was encouraged by that timeline, since this was the first-ever U.S. installation of its kind, and even well-known technologies have struggled through longer permitting processes.

## A different kind of wave power
If wave power can scale, it would be one of the precious few new electricity sources that have appeared on the scene since the rise of wind and solar. Next-generation nuclear designs have yet to send any power to the U.S. grid after years of effort and investment. Perhaps the closest thing to a new arrival is Fervo Energy’s advanced geothermal, which is operating in a 35 in Nevada.
Worldwide, ocean power ventures have failed in spectacular fashion. Harnessing Neptune’s wrath makes intuitive sense to many landlubbers: There’s so much energy out there, why not use it? Analysts at the International Energy Agency calculated that ocean and tidal energy could more than
The problem, as Odysseus learned long ago, is that Poseidon does not submit to the will of mortals. The list of ocean energy installations that broke and sank upon contact with waves is long and amusing to those who didn’t dedicate years of painstaking labor and millions of dollars to the doomed endeavors. And energy options don’t exist in a vacuum: Wave power, with all the costs to fortify it against the ocean itself, must compete with mass-manufactured solar panels to produce the exact same commodity, electricity.
Braverman is well aware of wave energy’s soggy past and the money wasted on contraptions “
The firm’s design favors simplicity across the board. Others tried installing out at sea, where waves are more powerful, but they rack up costs for ships and specialist divers, and then suffer from the same powerful waves they try to harness. Instead, Eco Wave Power focuses on far more accessible seawalls and jetties, and absorbs the waves with welded steel pontoons while the sensitive power conversion equipment sits safely on land nearby.
Financially, Braverman strives to prove a lot while spending very little. The company raised about $3051
Eco Wave Power employs 15EDF1002023LA
Last year, Eco Wave Power burned just $2
Still, financial discipline only matters here in service of generating clean power from the ocean. After delivering one project this year, Braverman expects to clinch three installations next year, in Taiwan, India, and Portugal. The commercial performance at Porto, with the company’s own money on the line, will become key evidence to persuade banks to lend money for future expansions of this singular technology.
The raging surf hasn’t killed this idea yet, but it still has to placate the gods of finance.

Public financing of the many reliability and policy-drive transmission projects that are needed in California will help stabilize bulk power costs as lower cost solar and storage projects are deployed to replace costly gas-fired generation as a dispatchable resource used for system reliability. California has made remarkable progress in improving reliability with over 14 gigawatts (GW) of battery storage now connected to the CAISO grid. Net qualifying capacity now stands at 59.7 GW compared to 53.0 GW a year ago.

Utilities and state regulators are backing a plan that would fast-track certain new fossil-gas power plants while leaving hundreds of gigawatts of competitively bid solar, wind, and battery projects mired in the boglike interconnection queue. They argue it’s an important emergency measure to prevent the risk of major outages on what is the U.S.’s largest transmission grid.

## The relicensing waiting game
The biggest obstacle to a hydropower comeback may be the relicensing bureaucracy. The problem is that the Federal Power Act — passed in 1920FERC
As a result, it takes eight years on average to relicense an existing hydropower facility, according to the National Hydropower Association, the leading U.S. trade group. That’s more than five times slower than licensing for the typical atomic power station. (Nuclear, hydroelectricity’s closest competitor for clean, always-available power, is also notorious for its slow permitting timeline.)
““18
With no central body in charge of permitting hydropower plants, multiple state agencies have been known to take advantage of the once-in-a-generation certification process — eliciting support for tangentially related projects from dam owners who once represented a big and growing business.
““50
At times, those concessions have little to do with the functioning of the hydropower plant itself. Woolf cited examples of dam owners pressed to build an amphitheater for Boy Scouts, and to fund the construction of regional roads that wouldn’t even go to the plant.
“

The eight-year timeline for relicensing is just an average.

To continue operating, hydroplant owners obtain one-year extensions as they inch toward full licenses. ““

One potential bright spot in the relicensing quagmire has been a shift in federal tax policy. For years, the wind and solar industries have benefited from a rule that treats facilities as new if owners reinvest at least 80
But so far, no hydroelectric facility has made use of the federal investment tax credit except one small plant that was destroyed in a flood, thus requiring a total reconstruction. That’s because until recently the industry still lacked clear guidance on how to apply the tax credit.

While renewables face ongoing opposition from the Trump administration, the president specifically named hydropower as a key priority in his Day 1“
## A fishy problem
Providing safe passage for fish through dams is a perpetual challenge, especially at older facilities that lack proper infrastructure. But dams that have been updated with newer, thinner turbine blades are also an issue, as the blades become guillotines for trout and salmon navigating through. American eels pose an even greater problem, as the snake-like fish — which can make up as much as
One of the simplest and most widely used tools to prevent fish from being killed in a dam’s turbines is a screen that blocks them from entering the plant’s water intake. Other methods include fish ladders or elevators that allow wildlife to ascend rising water to reach the other side. Less practical are trap-and-haul systems where fish are manually captured and set free above the dam.
““
!People stand along a waterway with rushing water along steps A fish ladder at the Bonneville Dam in Oregon. (
The key to overcoming the issue may be marrying the refurbishment of hydropower stations with environmental upgrades. In 2019
While the fish-safe blades are thicker than traditional turbine blades, Natel claims that its equipment is more efficient than the older equipment it’s replacing. Compared with turbines that are nearly 40CEO

Even replacing newer blades comes with little loss in efficiency.
“10“02
On balance, Schneider noted, plant owners get more out of the facility, because even with new traditional turbines, dams require very fine exclusion screens and other equipment that restrict water flow enough to reduce energy output by anywhere from 515
““02
## Old hydropower, new opportunities
At the moment, hydropower finds itself in a similar position to that of nuclear energy a few years ago, where existing facilities risk closure due to relicensing costs amid competition from cheaper newcomers. The U.S. is now actively looking to restart its nuclear program, with the once far-fetched prospect of new large-scale reactors under serious consideration. Even if hydropower can similarly flip its fortunes, few in the industry anticipate an appetite in the U.S. for a Hoover Dam–size project. Still, there is ample opportunity for new hydroelectric capacity.
Just 3800002012“
There are plenty of hydropower critics who welcome that stagnation. The history of damming rivers is rife with ecological destruction that fish-passage routes don’t entirely solve, as well as social upheaval from land seizures that uprooted poor, Black, and Indigenous communities from their homes to make way for new reservoirs.
And in parts of the U.S. where water is growing more scarce as the climate warms, reservoirs are drying up. Hydropower output in the American West hit a 22
While debate over hydropower continues in the U.S., nations overseas are moving ahead with new dam projects. In July, China 1

The day should soon arrive when we stop referring to Hydropower as ""clean energy"". Looking at the hotly discussed Lower Snake River dams -- federally owned and operated -- is telling.
The release of methane, a powerful Greenhouse Gas, from Lower Snake Reservoirs is estimated at 1.8 million tons annually, comparable to burning a million tons of coal. (TellTheDamTruth.com).
According to NOAA Fisheries reporting for decades, half of the ~24 million juvenile salmon leaving Idaho each year perish before leaving the Federal Columbia River Power System (""FCRPS""). Of those survivors, ~70% subsequently perish due to the harm of that harmful FCRPS migration experience.
The forest of Idaho, once fed by millions of spawned out salmon and steelhead annually, is now starving and in degraded condition. It has been estimated that the carbon output of the Pacific Northwest has essentially doubled due to the loss of the carbon sequestration once provided, not long ago. (See Landsat Timelapse imagery on the bluefish.org landing page).
Hydropower, at least in this case, is anything but clean. Let's start calling it something more appropriate, please.

Hydropower is not necessarily clean. Damming free flowing rivers, in addition to destroying or degrading aquatic and ancillary ecosystems does considerable damage, as we've seen first hand in real time. There are more benign forms of hydropower that I can support enthusiastically. Using water combined with elevation difference allows for using excess solar or wind power to pump from a lower, off stream reservoir to a higher one, and then run that water through a turbine when there's inadequate sunshine or wind. Another form is linear turbines in rivers that slow the flow slightly, but don't impound water or impede fish passage. Dams are not a good solution when viable alternatives exist.

AIdrive up energy costs for consumers. Or, they could simply agree to use less electricity during the handful of hours per year when the grid is under the greatest stress, making it possible for tech companies to get the power they need without straining the system.
It sounds like an easy fix, but in reality it’s complicated to modulate the demand of a data center that can use as much power as a small city. That’s why it’s rarely done today. In fact, a “
Now, the tech giant is taking its flexibility efforts one step further and applying the concept to the machine learning operations that underpin its large language models, the technology driving the current boom in AI
This month, Michael Terrell, Google’s head of advanced energy, &TVA“
Google’s new announcements are a really big deal, said Tyler Norris, a Duke University doctoral fellow and former solar developer and special adviser at the Department of Energy. That’s because they’re the first example of the kind of collaboration between data centers and utilities that needs to happen to keep costs from spiraling out of control.
Estimates of power demand from the AIare all over the map and hard to trust, but at a minimum, most experts agree that data center demand for electricity outstrips supply. Consumer advocates and state lawmakers are increasingly worried that this dynamic is going to cause electricity rates to surge, as utilities incur the costs of building the power plants and grid infrastructure to serve data centers, and potentially push those costs onto customer bills.
That supply-demand imbalance is also a problem for firms like Google and its competitors, which are locked in a multibillion-dollar race to build the best possible AI
Over the past five years or so, through its “
Until recently, it hadn’t messed with power demand for machine learning. This sort of flexibility is new territory for utilities and grid operators, too: It’s not standard practice to allow large customers to come online only if they agree to curtail their power use, Norris pointed out.
““
Flexible data centers like Google’s may have a significant advantage in getting those all-important electrons in the near term. A more rigid project may have to wait years to come online as grid infrastructure and power plants are built; a flexible data center, meanwhile, could be fast-tracked for interconnection using the grid capacity that’s already available.
The solution has its limitations, Terrell told Canary Media in an interview, but where it makes sense, it can be a powerful tool.

## The massive potential of shifting when data centers use power
The grid is crowded — but there’s plenty of room for data centers that can be flexible. That’s what Norris and a team of researchers at Duke University concluded in a February

In part because of this secrecy, it’s unclear how data center growth will play out in the real world. Most projections are based on speculative requests from developers seeking power in multiple locations for projects that may or may not end up being built.
But forecasts of data center growth generally indicate that they’re set to overwhelm the grid.
A December report from consultancy Grid Strategies found that five-year growth forecasts for U.S. utilities and grid operators have quintupled between 20222024, with data center hot spots such as Virginia, Georgia, Texas, and swaths of the Midwest particularly impacted. The past month has seen utilities in
That’s going to drive up utility rates, which are already rising due to a number of factors, including expensive investments in grid maintenance and expansion. While it can take time for the costs of accommodating new data centers to arrive on customers’ utility bills, the sheer scale of that expansion means that “
Those future costs are starting to pile up.
Georgia Power won regulatory approval earlier this year to move ahead with plans for a controversial and unprecedentedly rapid buildout of power plants, almost entirely based on huge, uncertain forecasts of data center growth. The company has filed a more than investment in fossil-fueled power to serve the world’s highest concentration of data centers. And Louisiana regulators last week 10

Norris argued that utilities, regulators, and grid operators must start demanding that would-be data centers commit to some level of flexibility to receive grid interconnection. “

And although most regulated utilities lack incentives to work on flexible interconnection — they earn guaranteed profits based on how much money they spend on grids and new power plants — Norris thinks the surge in demand could change their calculus.

If the federal government attempts to block the state clean car rules, they can respond with registration fees on new ICE car registration. The initial registration fees for fossil-powered cars can be set high enough to be a deterrent. It would take some serious legislation to impose FEDERAL standards on STATE vehicle registration policies.

A new state law set to take effect next month marks the end of New Hampshire’s flirtation with offshore wind — at least for now.
The
“
The move comes as President Donald Trump attempts to stop the emerging offshore wind industry in its tracks. On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order pausing all permitting and lease sales for new projects, and in the months that followed his administration has attempted to halt the construction of fully permitted offshore wind developments, including, most recently, the nearly complete Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island.
Other governors in New England, a region that has been counting on offshore wind for climate action and grid reliability, have been resolute in pushing projects forward. In fact, every coastal New England state aside from New Hampshire is party to a lawsuit seeking to overturn Trump’s offshore wind executive order.
The law marks a shift from the stance taken by previous governor, Republican Chris Sununu, who was in office from 20172025
Swing state New Hampshire has long been a libertarian-leaning outlier in deeply Democratic New England. On climate and energy issues, New Hampshire has generally been less aggressive than neighboring states: It doesn’t have legally mandated greenhouse gas reduction targets, has pulled back on energy-efficiency goals and programming, and recently all but drained its renewable energy fund to pay for other state needs.
For a time, however, the state seemed on the verge of embracing offshore wind. In 201920212022
“
This year’s legislative session, however, saw a flurry of bills aimed at keeping the New Hampshire government out of the business of offshore wind. One proposal even
The recently signed law is less aggressive, pulling away from offshore wind without prohibiting it. To soften the blow further, the state Senate, led by Democratic state Sen. David Watters, amended the legislation to make it clear that the energy innovation office would still have the authority to do work related to offshore wind if interest is revived in the future.
“
During the legislative process, however, it was clear that many interested parties saw the bill as a referendum on offshore wind in general, not merely the structure of government offices and committees. Public comments during a House hearing on the bill in February dwelled heavily on the perceived dangers of offshore wind, including potential threats to wildlife, possible hikes in electricity prices, and concerns about the intermittent nature of wind power.
The movement against offshore wind, observers said, is driven by a mix of national conservative hostility toward renewable energy and New Hampshire’s unique character. The state Senate is reasonably open to renewables, Watters said. However, the 400
Furthermore, the state has always been fiscally conservative, priding itself on its lack of sales and personal income taxes. It was always unlikely to offer tax incentives, like neighboring states, or take the risk of getting locked into a power purchase agreement at prices that could exceed market rates, said Sam Evans-Brown, executive director of Clean Energy New Hampshire.
“
Still, some clean energy advocates are concerned that the offshore wind law is a troublesome step backwards when the state needs to be charging ahead on renewables. There is widespread agreement that New England needs more power supply to help control soaring electricity prices and maintain grid reliability. At the same time, observers said, restraints on natural gas supplies make more gas-fired power generation unlikely, and building new nuclear facilities would be contentious; either option would take years to begin sending electrons into the grid.
Now, the Trump administration continues to throw up as many roadblocks as possible to offshore wind, potentially scuttling what may be the region’s best — and speediest — chance to build large-scale energy generation.
It makes no sense to let ideological objections to renewable energy get in the way of considering all available resources, said Nick Krakoff, senior attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation.
““
For others, the new law is a reasonable response to political realities in New Hampshire. If the state was never going to be a major supporter of offshore wind, it makes sense to focus the Office of Energy Innovation on measures that might actually have a fighting chance, Evans-Brown said, pointing to microgrids, battery developments, demand-flexibility programs, and electrification as promising options that would help the state make the most of the power production it has.
Advocates and policymakers across the board, however, are holding on to hope that while the state explores other courses of action, the development of offshore wind is merely delayed.

The fact that the federal government signed contracts with the state in accordance with a law passed by Congress should shield North Carolina’s Energy Saver rebate program from harm, Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Reid Wilson said at the launch.

That’s definitely something to keep an eye on. The boost from the Inflation Reduction Act gave REAP a real opportunity to expand its impact, but going back down to $50 million a year could really limit what projects get funded. It raises important questions about how we sustain momentum for clean energy and rural development once the extra funding dries up.

A bill on its way to the governor’s desk in New Hampshire could spur new, energy-efficient housing development in the state as soon as this summer, supporters say.
New Hampshire legislators on Thursday voted to adopt a loan program that will create a new way to finance clean energy and energy efficiency while making it easier to build residential developments in a state facing an acute housing shortage. The measure passed unanimously in the House and has broad support from Democrats, Republicans, environmental advocates, and the business community.
Gov. Kelly Ayotte (R) is expected to sign the bill into law shortly. Individual cities and towns will then need to vote to authorize the program in their communities, which could happen as soon as their annual spring town meetings in March and April. New construction projects could start taking advantage of the loans as soon as July or August, said developer Stephen Duprey, a supporter of the program.
““
Commercial property-assessed clean energy — or C-PACE — loans let commercial building developers and owners borrow money for clean energy and energy efficiency projects from a private lender but pay the money back through an added line item on their property tax bills. When the property is sold, the buyer takes on the loan as well, getting a higher tax bill but a building with lower operating costs. At the same time, the loans have longer terms than conventional financing, leading to lower payments.
C-PACE has been nominally on the books in New Hampshire since 2010
“
Then, last year, Duprey had a conversation with a lender who asked why New Hampshire didn’t have a C-PACE program. Duprey had a vague memory of the term but asked for more information about the program.
After listening to the lender’s explanation, he realized the model had potential to spur development of multifamily residential buildings — homes the state direly needs. If a developer uses C-PACE to finance the energy components of a new build — heat pumps, solar panels, insulation, efficient windows — they can take out a smaller mortgage for the construction and need less equity to fund the development, he said. That frees up money for building more units.
For Duprey, any benefits for energy efficiency or clean energy are secondary. ““
So Duprey asked the staff at the New Hampshire Business Finance Authority, of which he is vice chair, to investigate the existing C-PACE legislation and find out why it didn’t work. He discovered that the original version of the law put too many restrictions on the program to make it appealing. Municipalities were asked to carry too much of the administrative burden, he said. Banks were wary of a new kind of loan coming in and competing with their conventional products, Evans-Brown said.
Duprey, a former chair of the state Republican committee, began reaching out to his contacts in the legislature and the business community to work on a C-PACE overhaul that would eliminate these barriers.
The resulting bill has garnered widespread approval. Municipalities like that it places the responsibility of administering C-PACE on the state business finance authority, rather than individual cities and towns. To address banks’ concerns, the program will operate on a consent model that requires the approval of the lender that holds the first mortgage. Banks have also gained a lot of experience with these loans in the 15
Nationally, 362422012380415
““
The passage of the New Hampshire bill is a rare and very welcome example of bipartisan cooperation, in a particularly fractious moment for any climate action, said Evans-Brown.

If you didn’t think President Donald Trump’s attacks on offshore wind could get worse, think again. In just the last week, the administration targeted more already-permitted wind projects, slashed funding for projects tied to offshore wind, and enlisted a wide array of federal departments to go after the industry.
Trump vowed on the first day of his term that “
In late August, the Interior Department sent a stop-work order to the Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island, even though the development is just months away from completion. It echoed a similar — failed — attempt to halt construction of the Empire Wind project off the coast of New York back in April.
New England’s grid operator has since warned that delays will jeopardize power reliability and raise electricity prices, and even fishermen who voted for Trump are urging the administration to let work resume. Developer Ørsted and the states of Rhode Island and Connecticut are now suing the Trump administration to get Revolution Wind construction up and running.
The halt turned out to be just the start of a new wave of attacks. Late last week, the Transportation Department said it would 426turn a California port into the country’s first hub for floating offshore wind construction.
Recent federal court filings reveal the administration is also looking to revoke and reconsider permits for three already-approved projects:
And now, Trump is expanding his full-court press by calling on federal departments that typically have nothing to do with offshore wind,
If it wasn’t clear before, it is now: The Trump administration is going to leave no stone unturned in its attempt to stop offshore wind in America.

What utilities can learn from the data center capital of the world
As tech giants continue to build data centers, utilities will have to figure out how to meet growing electricity demand without raising power prices and carbon emissions. And in Virginia, Dominion Energy might be showing them what not to do, experts and advocates tell Canary Media’s Elizabeth Ouzts. The utility has already gotten regulators to approve its plan to build a raft of new fossil-fueled plants over the next 15state law requiring the total phaseout of fossil fuel power by 2045
Dominion isn’t in an enviable position, to be sure, as no utility can be sure of whether the data center power boom will fully come to fruition. But utilities can still turn to efficiency measures, battery storage, and grid-enhancing technologies to cut their need to add more power, and data centers can be flexible with their power usage to avoid overwhelming the grid.

Colorado is pushing hard to quickly approve a massive amount of renewable energy while the projects are still eligible for federal incentives.
The Republican tax and spending law that passed this summer drastically shortened the timeline for wind and solar projects to qualify for federal tax credits. Under the 20222033420262027
This sudden change puts states in a tight spot: If wind or solar projects can’t get started within a year, they’ll be considerably more expensive. And power demand and utility bills are already rising nationwide.
All of these factors are putting pressure on state energy regulators, who typically move at an exceedingly deliberative pace, which is to say, very slowly. The usual months of back and forth and obscure bureaucratic wrangling could force customers to pay billions of dollars more, based on the new deadlines from the Republican majority in Congress.
In recent weeks, Colorado became one of the first states to try getting ahead of that damaging outcome, creating a playbook others could learn from. Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, kicked off the effort with an Aug. 1“

Delivering on the faster schedule could save Xcel’s Colorado customers $520
For several years running, solar, wind, and batteries have accounted for over 90 to the U.S. power grid. New turbines for gas-fired plants are more or less sold out until 2030rising faster than it has in decades. For those reasons, experts still expect lots of renewable energy to be built even once subsidies expire.
But expediting projects now is still worthwhile. Federal tax credits can cut project costs by more than 30
“S2“
Indeed, it’s rare to find enthusiastic agreement between a monopoly utility and a ratepayer advocate, whose job is to contest utility spending that could raise bills for customers. In this case, the clear threat of higher energy prices from Trump administration policies has created an unusual alignment of interests. Ricketts refers to this catalyst as “
Speeding up regulatory approvals is valuable on a number of levels. The typical pace of states’ energy infrastructure deliberations has been out of step both with the urgency of the climate crisis and the more recent spike in electricity demand. Faster approvals of cheap clean energy projects could push down prices compared to further reliance on expensive, aging coal and gas plants. But the exigencies of climate change, demand growth, or customer wellbeing haven’t prompted the kind of speed-up that Trump’s reworking of federal energy policy achieved.
That said, the acceleration will be limited in its scope. States will have to allocate time and effort to salvage just some of the energy benefits that had been promised for a decade to come. Aguayo, from Xcel, described this as a ““

Part of one corporate separate case had an evidentiary hearing in the fall, but the rest of the cases remain unresolved.

The U.S. does not have a big enough power grid to accommodate rising energy demand — a fact that’s making electricity less affordable and reliable nationwide.
But there’s broad public support for growing the grid and allowing more electricity, including cheap, clean energy, to come online.
So says a severely backlogged PJMMISO
Roughly three-fourths of likely voters support expanding the electric grid, the survey found. About two-thirds are in favor of adding more transmission lines to connect clean energy and strengthen grid reliability.

He noted that the results stand out for their consistency between regions and among different groups — including political parties. Even so, the Trump administration has in recent months worked against grid expansion, not toward it.
## Adding more ​“
Energy costs are climbing in part because of rising power demand from data centers and the electrification of buildings and vehicles. Bringing more electricity generation online — especially quick-to-build, low-cost wind and solar — could increase competition and lower prices under the basic principles of supply and demand.
But just as transportation planners need to make sure highways can handle increased road traffic, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and regional transmission operators need to make sure the grid has room for more electrons. That calls for more “added transmission lines, plus technologies to squeeze more capacity out of the system overall.
Currently, “PJMMAREC
While all of the United States faces delays in getting new energy onto the grid, the problem is worst in the PJM2023PJM“
Across the country, wind, solar, and battery storage make up most of the resources waiting to come online, and their “
The Trump administration has called for “grid-enhancing technologies, “
But the administration’s actions have so far had the opposite effect. A February 49gigawatts of wind and solar power from the Great Plains to the East, and Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., has called the cancellation of its federal loan guarantee illegal.
The administration’s policies, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, are also expected to more than halve the amount of clean energy built over the next decade, further exacerbating concerns about soaring power prices and rising demand.
## What’s on voters’ minds
The survey results may help the Conservative Energy Network convince decision makers to take steps to expand the grid.
“PJMMISOCEO
The polling also gauged the persuasiveness of four statements to support grid expansion. The takeaways could inform how advocates and legislators work to boost public support for clean energy.
Among conservatives in Ohio and Pennsylvania, a message focused on lower costs was about 12
Opinions were more divided on whether the federal government, states, or private companies should pay for grid expansion, although a slight majority of respondents in both the PJMMISO
Respondents were also mixed on who should get to choose how electricity is produced. States, landowners, and local officials all ranked above federal authorities.
Clean energy, meanwhile, received only modest support on its own. About one-fourth of the Ohio and Pennsylvania respondents said using clean energy was one of their top two policy goals, with nearly one-fifth of those surveyed in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri giving that response.
Ultimately, affordability and reliability were the clear consensus energy policy priorities for poll respondents in both the PJMMISO
With the federal government standing in the way of both grid expansion and clean energy development, however, it will be tough for the voters to get the improvements they want.

Heat pumps, which are essentially reversible air conditioners, are key to electrifying heating. They provide potentially life-saving cooling, too.

(Gradient claims its heat pumps are also about 50AC
But retrofitting a building with a conventional heat-pump system can be a complex undertaking, requiring electrical upgrades and new refrigerant lines that run to individual air-handling units in each apartment, for example.

I'm curious what the residents will think of them during a deep freeze. Extreme cold has been the hang up with heat pumps this far. I know they've made progress on it, but I'm curious if it will be enough. If not, that old steam system will probably be fired up on the coldest months of the winter.

And once those plans are in motion, the chief incentive for data-center developers to commit to being flexible with their energy — getting faster grid interconnections — will evaporate.
Grid planners and utilities face an unprecedented wave of power demand as tech giants race to build data centers to support their artificial-intelligence ambitions. In many cases, plans for new data centers — the largest of which can use as much power as a small city — are spurring the construction of new fossil-fueled power plants, putting decarbonization further out of reach and raising costs for consumers.
The GridLab–Telos Energy report adds to a growing body of work identifying flexibility as a way for data centers to connect to the grid quickly without causing utility costs and emissions to skyrocket.
To become flexible, data centers will need to invest in gas-fired generators, batteries, solar panels, or other resources to supply their own power needs during times of peak demand. Or they’ll need to take on the technically complex task of ramping down power-hungry computing processes when the grid is under the greatest stress.

Similar load-growth pressures driven by the AI are pushing utilities across the country to plan far more new gas-fired power plants, at great cost not only to the climate but also to customers, who will pay higher bills to cover the cost of building and fueling them.

## How to bring data-center flexibility into the real world
Getting data centers to commit to energy-flexible operations could make a huge difference across the country, according to Tyler Norris, a Duke University doctoral fellow who is a former solar developer and special adviser at the Department of Energy. He co-authored an 100
Getting data centers to ease off during specific hours of the year is eminently feasible, Norris argued in an August presentation to state utility regulators. Data centers’ “50
But utility planners can’t build a grid around estimates, and data-center developers don’t have good reasons to commit to using less power unless they see a clear reward.

Nor do data centers have a clear path to achieve the kind of flexibility that utility planners may demand, said Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid-edge research for analytics firm Wood Mackenzie.

But data centers can’t run megawatts of noisy, polluting, and expensive diesel generators without running afoul of air-quality regulations and enraging neighbors, he said. True flexibility will require more novel options like gas-fired generators and batteries charged from the grid or on-site solar systems, he added.

I think it's more likely that instead of passing the savings on to their customer base the utilities just pad their profits. Eversource, our local power company just keeps raising rates for power and also their distribution fees. New Hampshire has the highest electrical rates in the country with no relief in sight, regardless of all the buildout of alternative sources of power. What doesn't help either is the Public Utilities Commission is a rubber stamp for all the utilities in the state. The natural gas and water industries in the state also benefit from the PUC's largess, at the expense of the ratepayers in the state.

You better check your math, 4.4GW of 28.5GW is only 15.44% not 22%. That makes it difficult to trust the rest of the your reporting in the story.

This article gives me hope. Distributed power generation not only reduces stress on the existing grid, during periods of peak demand, but also reduces the need for high cost additions to the existing grid.
And, In addition, distributed power is produced closer to the points of consumption, thereby reducing the delivery costs of electricity.

In 2023, France did what we have failed to do, when owners of ALL existing parking lots larger than 80 spaces were required to install solar parking lot canopies within 5 years, and within 3 years for very large lots. That's just blazing fast deployment of a nation-wide matrix of reliable community micro grids.
France has the highest % of nuclear power generation and a single nationalized electric utility. You can understand their logic. During heat waves, their nuclear power production must be curtailed to avoid over-heating cooling river water. Solar production is somewhat reduced too, but not as much, and peak daily solar production aligns with peak air conditioning load. And it can be stored in on-site BESS batteries for night-time use. It's estimated that widely distributed Parking Lots in France can provide about 50% of the power of all their nuclear plants. No new utility transmission, site acquisition, or other site improvement spending required. And no lengthy, expensive permitting or armies of litigious NIMBYS.

As the Trump administration doubles down on fossil fuels, the rest of the world is investing more and more in clean energy.

Investors haven’t looked back since — and all forms of clean energy have taken off as a result, led by China, the world’s most prominent “415IEA
This widening gap suggests some progress in the global effort to move away from fossil fuels. Investment is a leading indicator of actual, physical things — new solar plants, wind turbines, power lines, and more — being built. The trillions invested in this year, last year, and so on, will translate to record-breaking amounts of clean-energy installations in the years to come.
But despite the promise, IEA2023
Meanwhile, fossil fuel investment has remained stubbornly high even as it loses ground to clean energy. Only in 2020COVID-191
That mirrors a concerning trend within the global power sector: Renewables are growing at a record-breaking pace, faster than many thought possible, and yet emissions are still rising as countries simply use more electricity, burning more fossil fuels as a result. This dynamic will not solve climate change. In order for the world to decarbonize, investment in clean energy needs to be high enough for it to displace — and drive down — fossil-fuel use.

California, for all its talk of clean energy and climate leadership, has long depended on fossil gas to keep its lights on. A decade ago, gas provided around 60
California’s solar systems, from rooftop panels to massive desert installations, generated nearly as much electricity as its gas plants last year, according to data pulled from think tank Ember’s 2012
Solar far outpaces all other electricity sources in new power plant construction, not just in California but in Texas and the nation as a whole. But that metric is measured in megawatts of production capacity — it doesn’t tell us how much electricity solar panels actually make in the course of a year. Solar produces only when the sun shines, so it needs more megawatts of nameplate generating capacity to rival sources like gas or nuclear that can operate around the clock.
That’s why this chart is so striking: It displays actual electricity production in California throughout 202430
This inflection point represents the culmination of yearslong trends. Gas surged to a record level in 2012hot summer nights and mild shoulder months alike.
Over the last decade, it’s worth noting, generation from nuclear, wind, and geothermal has stayed flat, and hydropower fluctuated with the annual weather patterns. Those carbon-free sources all have their own passionate advocates and deeply researched reports from the Department of Energy on how they can break out of stasis and grow again. But solar is the only one of the bunch consistently increasing production year over year.
That’s not guaranteed to always be the case. The Republican-led Congress still could axe federal tax credits that currently support renewable installations for the next decade. California has also gotten in its own way, as when Gov. Gavin Newsom’s handpicked utility regulators chose to dismantle the prevailing rules for rooftop solar, greatly diminishing the pace of residential installations.
Nonetheless, if gas power production continues its downward plunge, California will eventually have to figure some things out. Specifically, it needs other tools to ensure on-demand power through the nights and weather patterns that dampen solar production.
State grid planners have ordered utilities to start procuring long-duration energy storage, a category of technologies promising to deliver steady clean power for far longer than lithium-ion batteries can manage at today’s price points. The state is also taking early steps to open up its coastline for offshore wind development; the deep Pacific seabed calls for floating turbines, a newer technology that has not yet been built in the U.S. Efforts to better connect the western grid could also make it easier to balance supply and demand across the region.
California, whose state economy would rank fifth among the world’s nations, is not a place that can change course in an instant. But this impending unseating of gas power by solar shows what can happen over a decade of dedicated policy, regulatory, and business efforts to push down carbon emissions and accelerate clean energy. It took time to get to this point, but now the results are undeniable.

As Illinois looks to prepare its electric grid for the future, a new voluntary program in the Chicago area promises to lower costs for both customers and the utility system as a whole.
ComEd is finalizing plans to roll out time-of-use rates in 20266597
Under a plan before state utility regulators, customers who sign up would pay a much steeper energy-delivery charge during afternoon and early evening hours but see a significant discount overnight. The goal is to shift use to hours when the grid tends to be less congested as well as deliver cleaner and cheaper power.
“
Most standard customers are set to pay an energy-delivery charge of 59“107173
“17
Under the proposal, most time-of-use rate customers would pay delivery rates of around 46179
The details were approved in January by the Illinois Commerce Commission but put on hold last Thursday after commissioners agreed to consider a request by ComEd to also incorporate energy-supply charges into the program. (The initial proposal included only the portion of customers’ bills that pays for the delivery of energy but not the cost of electricity itself.)
The Citizens Utility Board is happy with the plan approved in January, DeBellis said, and it wants to ensure a delivery-only option remains for customers who buy power from alternative retail electric suppliers since these customers would not be able to participate in a supply-charge ComEd program. The utility watchdog also would have liked the “

The prospect of limiting air conditioning on hot afternoons could dissuade people from enrolling in the program, DeBellis continued. “

## Pilot lessons
ComEd crafted the time-of-use program after a four-year pilot and a public comment process overseen by state regulators. The pilot was focused on the energy supply part of the bill, but DeBellis noted that the lessons apply to any time-of-use program, since demand peaks are the same regardless of which part of the bill one looks at.
The pilot program’s final annual report showed that both EV“6EV10307020232024

Many utilities around the country already offer time-of-use programs: 42829
ComEd’s filings with state regulators include a survey of 15
ComEd also saw larger reduction in summer peak-time electricity demand than many of the other time-of-use rates. ComEd’s program structure was similar to that of the other utilities, the company doing the study found, though in California, peak times were later in the afternoon, likely because of the state’s climate and proliferation of solar energy.
## Hours and education
The program is designed to be revenue-neutral, meaning ComEd won’t earn more or less depending on when people use energy. Still, it has potential to lower costs to the system overall by helping to make more efficient use of existing infrastructure and postponing the need for new generation or transmission investments.
The new time-of-use rate would only apply only to residents. Industrial and commercial customers already have an incentive to use power at night, since their energy-delivery charge is based on their highest 30966

Some clean-energy groups had argued for a program that automatically enrolls residents unless they opted out. DeBellis said the Citizens Utility Board promoted the opt-in version that is currently proposed.
“
The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, introduced into the state legislature in February and backed by a coalition of advocacy groups, would mandate large utilities offer residential time-of-use rates, outlining a structure similar to what ComEd is planning. After the rates have been in place for a year, the Illinois Commerce Commission could do a study to see if the rates are indeed reducing fossil-fuel use and work with utilities to adjust if needed.
While the commission’s ruling last week reopens debate about the program’s structure, a ComEd spokesperson said the company is confident it will be available by next year.

It's not clear how this program (ComEd’s Rate BEST)compares with the currently available ComEd’s Hourly Pricing program, Rate BESH (Basic Electric Service Hourly Pricing). Ideally you would be able to see which program saves you more money. Also, how will Rate BEST work with with PV and home batteries?

Connecticut lawmakers are touting newly introduced legislation as a way to lower out-of-control power bills, but opponents say it could devastate the state’s renewable energy progress. Provisions of the complex, 80
“
Connecticut’s high electricity rates — clean energy programs are driving high prices.
That belief is the basis of some provisions in
The proposed legislation includes several sections that do not explicitly address clean energy. It calls for the creation of an in-state procurement authority to watch the power markets and, ideally, buy electricity at better prices. The bill would also eliminate the sales tax on electricity purchased by commercial and industrial users, and mandate an expansion of variable time-of-use rates, which nudge households to use less energy during high-demand times by raising the price of electricity.
Renewable energy advocates, however, are focused on three elements they claim would completely undermine state support for clean energy and energy-efficiency programs without creating any overall savings for the public.
## Nuclear credits would undermine renewables
The first measure that worries advocates is a small wording change that would define existing nuclear power generation in the state — a category that includes only the Millstone Power Station — as a Class I renewable energy source. This designation would allow Millstone to sell renewable energy credits (RECs) as part of the state’s renewable portfolio standard.
Under the standard, utilities must buy RECs to offset a certain percentage of the power they sell. That proportion rises over time: This year, for example, Connecticut utilities must procure enough renewable energy to meet 3032
If Millstone were allowed to sell Class I RECs, it could do so at much lower prices than other clean energy sources because the nuclear plant is already built and running without this added financial support, said Francis Pullaro, president of renewable energy nonprofit RENEWREC
There would also be little need for solar or wind RECs in the market if Millstone were allowed to sell credits. In 20233326REC
The effect would be to render the renewable portfolio standard essentially meaningless, he said.
“RPS
## Removing incentives for residential solar
Another major issue advocates have flagged in the bill is a proposed change to how homeowners with solar panels are compensated when their systems generate extra power that flows onto the grid, a process called net metering. The legislation would allow homeowners to receive credit only for the supply of excess power they generate, and not for the costs of distribution or transmission, which are currently part of the compensation calculations. The rationale for this change stems from a concern that customers without solar will find themselves footing the bill for compensating households with solar.
The new rule would make rooftop solar “2024
““
The third area of concern for advocates is the bill’s proposal to eliminate the public benefits charge from customers’ power bills. That’s a fee that helps pay for energy-efficiency programs, a state clean energy fund, assistance to low-income customers, mandated nuclear power purchases, and other energy-related public policy programs. The legislation would create a Green Bond Fund that would borrow money to pay these costs, removing them from monthly bills and spreading out the financial impact over the bond repayment period.
Many advocates, however, worry that this approach would result in less certain funding for the energy-efficiency and clean energy programs currently supported by the public benefits charge. As outlined in the legislation, the bond fund would be able to spend up to $800868202312024
The bond fund “
The Finance, Revenue, and Bonding Committee voted favorably on the bill last week, and it is now expected to

Utility customers will pay the price — literally — if the Trump administration continues to unnecessarily force fossil-fueled power plants to stay open in the name of grid reliability, energy experts and regulators warn.
An April obligate power plants to keep operating, even after utilities, states, and regional grid operators have spent years making sure they’re safe to close.
Last week, in response to the order, the DOE2030“J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan and the
Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated ““
But energy analysts say the report uses worst-case scenarios to reach its conclusions, mainly by ignoring the hundreds of gigawatts of new generation — almost all of it solar, batteries, and wind power — slated to come online in the near future. Meanwhile, state regulators and environmental and consumer groups have challenged the DOE, arguing it overstepped sound grid-planning policy and precedent to solve a grid “
Ordering aging fossil-fueled power plants to stay open would force utility customers to pay billions of dollars for some of the least efficient and least reliable power plants on the grid — not to mention those worst for the climate and the health of nearby communities.
Coal has shrunk from nearly half the country’s electricity generation in 200815282024202162
It’s difficult to predict how much more expensive power could get if the DOERMI

““
Alison Silverstein, an energy analyst and former adviser to the Public Utility Commission of Texas and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, agreed. “
Indeed, many U.S. utilities are operating coal plants that can’t compete on cost with gas-fueled facilities and renewables. This practice, known as “
All told, think tank RMI“24201520249200
Making more aging fossil-fueled power plants stay open would only further inflate these costs borne by utility customers, at a time when energy prices are already slated to soar due to Trump administration policies.
## The financial fallout of uncertainty
It’s especially costly to utility customers when long-running plans to close down a power plant are abruptly reversed. That’s exactly what’s happened with the J.H. Campbell plant, one of the two facilities the Trump administration has ordered to stay open in recent months.
In its case, the additional expenses associated with the sudden reversal may range from

Jeff, I don't think you understand the electricity market. The Energy Innovation article is fundamentally flawed. The electricity that we consume comes from a variety of sources including merchant power plants and base load generators that have long term PPAs. Most merchant power plants like Merrimack Station in NH rely on forward capacity payments to offset fixed operating costs. Unlike base load plants, these merchant plants only come online when there is demand. During high demand periods, power prices are higher. So the average price for a megawatt generated by a coal plant like Merrimack Station is higher because they only produce when prices are high or ISO New England tells them to run (typically when demand outstrips supply and prices are high). The same would be the case for a wood burning biomass power plant that receives capacity payments. Their average generating cost is higher because they run during peak periods. What this article is actually telling us is that power prices are higher on average when merchant plants are dispatched because there are less merchant plants and more non-dispatchable generators like solar and wind farms. Coal power isn't more expensive because of the cost of coal. It's more expensive because the market supports it. Otherwise, the coal plants wouldn't run.
The article also doesn't consider the cost of capacity payments which have increased in recent years to offset the reduction in dispatchable generation. These costs are passed to directly to rate payers. Basically, the subsidies that solar and wind farms receive through tax incentives allow those projects to put cheap power on the grid. However, that power is unreliable. So organized markets like ISO New England charge rate-payers more money per MW to subsidize fossil fuel dispatchable plants to remain available. Retaining more dispatchable generation, whether coal or natural gas or some other fuel, will help keep prices down.

Dean Solon stands out as one of the very few
But a few weeks ago, as he and I found seats outside the Midwest Solar Expo in a far western suburb of Chicago, it was clear the major cashout hadn’t changed his style. Solon, age 61
““2017100
In fact, Solon’s instinct to tinker and solve problems has thrust him back into the solar manufacturing space at the industry’s most chaotic moment in years.
““
Solon has decided to compete in these dire circumstances by essentially building the entire menu of items needed for a modern solar, battery, or microgrid project, and designing all the pieces to fit together seamlessly. His new firm, Create Energy, will sell developers solar modules, trackers, batteries, inverters, power stations, and other auxiliary equipment. The goal is to save customers time and effort compared to buying separately from a tracker vendor, a module vendor, an inverter vendor, and so on, and then assembling all those components with separate crews.
It’s an ominous time to start a new solar manufacturing business in America, to say the least. After a booming few years following the implementation of the 2022
What better moment to check in with one of the most singular voices in the solar industry, who has survived and thrived through the solarcoaster of the last two decades without wavering in his commitment to American manufacturing?
## U.S. factories can work, but tariffs are complicating the buildout
Solon’s previous company Shoals originally made automotive parts for Bosch back in the ‘90
Around that same time, he got an inbound request from a budding solar enterprise that needed some manufactured junction boxes and cable assemblies; that upstart turned out to be First Solar, pretty much the only U.S. panel manufacturer that has excelled over the last few decades (and whose stock has been on a tear as Congress prepared to revoke tax credits for solar projects that use Chinese-made materials).
Once he made the jump into solar equipment in the early 2000
““‘70
That ethos continues in the new venture. The strategy is to build high-quality equipment and find customers who understand its value, because they’re investing with a longer-term mindset.
““
In theory, a company with this attitude would welcome tariffs, which raise the cost of cheaply produced competition from Chinese factories. The last few months have seen new tariffs aplenty, though Trump has waived some within days or weeks of announcing them. But while tariffs are often billed as helpful to domestic manufacturers, President Trump’s tariffs are also causing complications for the American factory buildout.
For starters, Trump’s blanket tariffs on all Chinese goods impact manufacturing equipment produced in that country. Not only does China make most of the world’s solar panels — it also makes many of the machines required to manufacture solar.
““
“
Even if Solon could get his hands on that equipment without exorbitant price hikes, the U.S. lacks enough production of solar cells — the component that actually converts sunlight into electricity — to meet the demand for domestic module assembly. Factories that can’t obtain the limited domestic cells need to import them, but the so-called reciprocal tariffs Trump has announced on much of the world, and then delayed, have scrambled the economics for cells from outside the U.S.
Create is making other products at its Portland, Tennessee, factory, but the timeline for making solar modules in-house has been pushed back due to the macroeconomic headwinds.
## To enter the solar market today, deliver big savings
A decade ago, solar module costs started to plunge, and the price of solar-generated power fell along with it. That has propelled solar to the front of the pack for new power plant construction. But lately the slope of cost declines has leveled off, and incremental module improvements do less and less to push the cost of solar power lower.
Solon is stepping into that mature marketplace, so he has to bring something new to the table to stand out. After years of making the electrical connectors needed to hook up solar panels into a functioning power plant, he realized he could eliminate several steps for installers with clever design hacks.
Today’s standard solar-plant construction process creates inefficiencies. “‘
A singular project might have different crews clear the earth, pound the posts, add torque tubes, bolt the modules in place, check the torque on the bolts, handle the electrical work, and then clean up the site, he said.
The new products from Create come with electrical connections pre-wired into the modules and the torque tubes of the trackers. Installers can easily snap everything together, at which point, Solon insists, the systems won’t need any more maintenance.
Solon’s goal was to make installation so easy that it would be doable for an avatar of the modern man that he refers to as ““12
“AI“
That vision would threaten a number of specialized jobs in the solar installation and maintenance business. But it would also deliver more efficient construction, so the same workforce could theoretically deliver more clean power in the same amount of time. If Solon can pull it off, that kind of benefit could be valuable as the industry stares down the loss of its decades-long tax-credit regime.
## The solar industry is in for a period of pain, so stability matters
Solon doesn’t deny that the solar industry writ large is heading for a contraction, but he rejects the more apocalyptic outlooks some fear for the sector. Instead, he thinks it’ll be a reset for the industry after the bounty of Biden-era policy supercharged the pace of activity.
““
The wave of bankruptcies has already begun, taking down longtime industry stalwarts like solar loan provider Mosaic, rooftop solar financier Sunnova, grid-battery integrator Powin Energy, and more.
It’s not a bad time to have a billion dollars in the bank and several decades of manufacturing experience.

Geothermal is one of the cleanest ways to produce electricity. And it is the only renewable energy technology that has largely stayed out of the crosshairs of President Donald Trump, who has slashed federal support for renewable and clean energy, including wind and solar.

However, industry insiders are ringing the alarms and pressuring the U.S. Congress to not eliminate clean energy tax credits and incentives included in former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. If those tax credits are phased out, insiders say it would cripple the industry before it has a chance to get on its feet.

Traditionally, geothermal was limited to places with naturally occurring underground hot reservoirs, usually near tectonic plates or in volcanic areas.
But evolutions in geothermal have opened the door for developers to utilize oil and gas drilling technologies which help lower costs and allow them to create their own reservoirs almost anywhere. The models fall in two categories: enhanced geothermal systems, or EGS
With EGS“
Closed-loop systems use an underground network of sealed wells where water or fluid is pumped and heated without ever coming in direct contact with rocks. It is then piped into the homes and buildings connected to the system. These systems also cool buildings by drawing out heat during warm weather.

He says geothermal’s appeal includes a low carbon footprint, reliability, and established drilling technology pioneered by the oil and gas industry. Unlike batteries and wind power, geothermal does not rely on
It’s also among the more expensive energy sources because it requires specialized drilling, installation equipment, and skilled workers trained to build it all. Supporters say the industry will continue to need federal tax credits and funding to grow, especially in communities where utility bills are already unaffordable.
While many geothermal units serve just a single household, systems that serve many buildings are more affordable.

## Harnessing batteries for the race to power AI
Batteries aren’t, at first glance, a tool well matched to the needs of AI
Lithium-ion chemistries have become quite competitive for short-form activities: First, it was managing second-by-second frequency fluctuations on the grid; now, in places like Australia, California, and Texas, batteries are shifting solar generation to compete with gas plants in the evening when demand rises.
Data centers, though, use energy around the clock — not literally at full blast 247AI
As a lot of exceedingly well-funded firms contemplated this conundrum, some thinkers started focusing on grid flexibility as a way to accelerate the computing-infrastructure buildout. Earlier this year, Duke University researcher Tyler Norris made waves in the AI-energy world with
The Aligned battery offers a concrete example of that kind of research. The utility studied just how big the battery would need to be to compensate for challenges imposed on the local grid by the data center. Aligned and Calibrant had their own calculations, Martin said, “
Due to the local nature of the power constraint, the battery had to be built close to Aligned’s facility; the company ultimately provided the land to host the grid storage installation. In other cases, where a proposed data center runs up against a system-wide capacity constraint, a battery solution could be further away.
Another glimpse of the battery-enabled future came this summer when Redwood Materials, a richly funded battery-recycling startup, unveiled a new business line that repackages old EV to serve data-center demand. The first installation, at Redwood’s campus near Reno, Nevada, fully powered a very small, modular data center using a solar array and a field of former EV
Redwood just got its own vote of confidence in that concept: On Thursday, it
## Business model protects other utility customers
Aligned’s commitment to paying for the battery itself could serve as a model of socially responsible AI-infrastructure development.
Some utilities around the country are jumping to build new power plants to support the projected data-center buildout, and charging their regular customers for the investment, hoping the AIAI
Because Aligned is footing the bill, the utility’s other customers won’t be forced to pay for the data-center firm’s growth ambitions. But, though this one large customer will provide the land and funding, the battery will sit on the utility side of the meter. That means the utility can leverage the tech for other grid uses, like frequency management and capacity, when it’s not maintaining the flow of power to the data center during otherwise scarce hours.
In this case, Martin said, the permitting and buildout could move faster with the battery connecting to the utility grid instead of directly to the data center. In other situations, bigger batteries on the customer side of the meter might make more sense. Calibrant is already working on more and even larger batteries for the AI

I do not see any reference to long-duration battery solutions here, but the mentioning of ""simply dial back their consumption for a couple hours at a time during moments of maximum demand"" is an indication that the larger energy capacity of LDES is something to be explored, especially as the longer life of most LDES options provide much lower LCOE than 2-hour and 4-hour lithium batteries in the long term...

The House voted almost entirely along party lines on Thursday to approve a big budget bill that would send many of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy provisions to an early grave. Now the Senate will take a shot at drafting its own version.
Two major losses in the House bill are the production and investment tax credits for clean power projects known as 45 and 48, which would be phased out much more quickly than under the IRA602028
Nuclear power, on the other hand, made out a little better. Advanced nuclear facilities would only have to start construction by the end of 202845 and 48 tax credits.
Several more clean energy incentives face straight-up termination, including tax credits homeowners can use to install electric appliances and make energy-efficient home improvements. The bill would also end tax credits for buyers of EVs, and then punish all EV250

Americans toss out roughly a billion dollars’ worth of aluminum drink cans a year — a valuable heap that the U.S. aluminum industry has long been working to keep from landfills. Recycling old metal into new products requires dramatically less energy than producing aluminum from scratch, giving companies a cheaper and lower-carbon way to make the versatile material.
Now, U.S. trade policy is lending new urgency to the effort to rescue discarded metal from junkyards and garbage bins across the country.

Scrap metal, as a result, is an increasingly hot commodity. American companies are both importing more of it — the tariffs don’t apply to scrap — and scouring the country for domestic reserves of crumpled beverage cans, spare car parts, and bent-up building beams.
Demand for recycled aluminum was already rising before the tariff hike. Everyone from electric-vehicle makers and construction firms to solar-panel companies and packaging producers has been sourcing more of the relatively clean material as they work to reduce carbon emissions from their own supply chains.

Underlying all these trends is the fact that the U.S. makes far less primary, or nonrecycled, aluminum than it used to, with only four of the nation’s smelters still operating today. Each of the facilities can gobble enough electricity annually to power a mid-sized U.S. city, whereas recycling operations use only about 5

Still, it’s unclear how President Donald Trump’s trade policies will affect low-carbon aluminum production in the long run. While some recyclers stand to immediately benefit from the increased reliance on scrap, the results across the industry have been murkier.
Total aluminum shipments from U.S. and Canadian facilities fell 45

Century and another company, Emirates Global Aluminium, are both planning to build entirely new smelters in the U.S., which together would nearly triple the nation’s primary-aluminum capacity. However, the smelters likely won’t come online for several years or more, meaning they won’t help reduce the supply crunch or price pain facing the industry right now.

Rooftop solar is already struggling in the U.S. — but the budget bill passed by House Republicans last month would send the sector into a tailspin.
Just 220266051GW
The reason for this projected sharp decline is that the GOP2022can make solar 30.
It’s bad timing for those hoping to lower their energy costs by installing rooftop solar. Across the country, utility bills are rising, and the budget bill and other Trump administration actions impeding clean energy development are expected to drive the price of energy up further.
Most households that install rooftop solar
But without these tax credits, installing rooftop solar will be significantly more expensive — putting it out of reach for many, especially the lower-income residents who stand to benefit the most. It would take the average homeowner five or six years longer to break even on their solar system if incentives disappear, per Ohm Analytics.
The tax-credit repeal would be only the latest blow to residential solar in the U.S., 68
That same year, California, the country’s largest residential solar market, slashed the amount of money households can earn from selling solar power back to the grid, eroding the economics of solar as a result. High interest rates over the last few years have also hampered installations because most buyers finance solar panels. In recent weeks, two major national rooftop-solar firms have gone bankrupt due to a combination of these factors and the new uncertainty over the tax credits.
It remains unclear what the final outcome for the tax credits will be. On Monday, the Senate Finance Committee released
If the tax credits are indeed repealed or significantly reduced, it would be a major setback not only for energy affordability and for the U.S. residential solar industry that

Infant industry subsidies are supposed to go away eventually. If, as the article suggests, homeowners can still recover their investment in 5-6 years without the credits, perhaps it is time for these credits to fade away.
In the years since the 30% solar ITC was originally adopted, a decade ago, the cost of solar has dropped by much more than 30%. So the economics today, without a tax credit, are better than they were a decade ago with the tax credit.
Of course, the flip side of the tax credits COULD BE a national carbon tax or cap and trade system. That would help pay down the deficit, and have the same effect on solar affordability as a tax credit. This Congress and this President are not likely to pursue this obvious solution. But the next one might.

The article said it could take ""five or six years longer to break even..."", not 5-6 years total. It will be 10+ years payback period for most homeowners unless the cost of energy is extremely high or you can install yourself. Also it doesn't seem logical to phase out renewable incentives while leaving massive subsidies for the oil & gas industry. This is all backwards. But I do think solar has gotten cheap enough that it can be competitive especially when interest rates come down.

I know that eliminating the federal ITC would be a hardship for a number of solar companies and the industry would be better with the ITC in place. However, it may be counterintuitive but it could actual turn out to help advance solar in the long run. DER Solar is on par cost wise with other generation sources. The drawback is its subsidies. This BBB action means DER solar can stand out as a generation source installed without federal subsidies unlike nuclear and fossil fuels. Just flip the tables on federal subsidies. Today with the ITC DER solar SPBs are around 7 years and this will push that back up to 10+ year. The industry has lived in the past with a SPB around 10 years when costs were $12 to $18 a watt installed and had grown. The industry needs to refocus on DER solar benefits - you make your own fuel to power your EV and heat pump lowering your costs. It can lower the load on the distribution system if paired with battery storage under FERC Order 2222. DER Solar can lower supply costs by reducing the need for supply side generation, transmission and ancillary services without federal subsidies. And if DER Solar can do this let's end all direct and indirect energy subsidies and than lets see who can actually compete. Hope for the best - keeping the ITC but prepare for the worse.

Overall, renewable resources produced around 32 in 202440
Nevertheless, emissions from the global power sector have not declined. In fact, they rose by 172023
For one, although renewables dominate new construction, the world still has a massive fleet of fossil-fired power plants, and those continue to tear through huge volumes of coal, gas, and oil to keep the lights on. Also, the amount of
The problem is particularly acute in 15
Rising power demand is also a thorn in the side of decarbonization efforts. As hotter summers drive up the use of air-conditioning and large industrial power customers like data centers expand, new clean electrons are often simply meeting new demand rather than enabling old polluting power plants to shutter.
Still, there’s no arguing with the fact that the global power system is moving toward clean energy and away from fossil fuels. The problem is that this shift is happening too slowly. And when it comes to averting the worst of the climate crisis, pace matters just as much as direction.

A community solar farm run by Nexamp in Massachusetts. The developer currently has dozens of community solar projects operating in Illinois, too. (
Community solar has thrived in Illinois, thanks to clean-energy laws passed by state legislators in 20162021sent to an early grave by the GOP
The beauty of community solar is that it allows anyone, even those who can’t put photovoltaic panels on their own properties, to access solar energy via subscriptions to a larger array sited elsewhere. Until congressional Republicans passed their budget law this summer, the companies building community solar could tap federal tax credits into the 203020262027
Before any power-generating project can connect to the grid, it needs to undergo a lengthy review. Utilities must determine the project’s viability and the cost of grid upgrades that it might require, which the developer usually pays for and needs to know ahead of time to secure financing. Though the process is notorious for taking too long, the actual length of time a proposal spends in this interconnection queue can vary greatly depending on the utility.
Advocates are calling out Ameren, which serves central and southern Illinois, for taking longer than the norm. One major reason is that the utility only studies community solar applications one at a time. At that rate, it takes years or even decades for proposals to be reviewed and ready for construction.
By contrast, ComEd, the utility that serves northern Illinois, reviews multiple project proposals concurrently and “

But the utility must balance the benefits of hiring more people to do the studies with the costs for those hires, which customers will ultimately pay for in their bills, she added.
Ameren is also working to address other reasons for interconnection delays.
For example, sometimes the utility spends a lot of time reviewing a project, only to ultimately decide it cannot be approved at all. To avoid this unnecessary use of resources, Love said Ameren is “

Collingsworth said that more information and transparency from the utility make developers’ jobs easier, since they know which proposals to prioritize.
Love said Ameren has made maps and queue reports more user-friendly, so that developers will have a better idea of which projects are worth pursuing. The utility is also offering companies “
While delays have not been a major problem in ComEd territory, according to developers, the utility has also taken steps to reduce interconnection wait times. It is allowing the use of a letter of credit or escrow account instead of cash as the deposit needed before construction can begin, and it is connecting developers seeking to do projects on the same part of the grid, so they can potentially collaborate to reduce costs.

The Chicago Teachers Union expects its new, hard-fought contract to help drive clean energy investments and train the next generation of clean energy workers, even as the Trump administration attacks such priorities.
The contract approved by 97

## Training Chicago’s students for clean energy jobs
The union crafted its proposals based on discussions with three environmental and community organizations, Bianchi said — the Southeast Environmental Task Force, People for Community Recovery, and ONE

Clean energy job training was a priority for all three of the organizations, Potter said.
Under the contract, the union and district officials will work with other labor unions to create pre-apprenticeship programs for students, which are crucial to entering the union-dominated building trades to install solar, do energy-efficiency overhauls, and electrify homes with heat pumps and other technology. The contract demands the district create one specific new clean energy jobs pathway program during each year of the four-year contract.
It also mandates renovating schools for energy efficiency and installing modern HVAC

Maine’s solar incentive program has become a political scapegoat for rising electricity prices in the state, but clean-energy advocates say the numbers don’t add up.
Maine utility customers pay some of the country’s highest electricity prices, but the portion of their monthly bills that goes toward buying surplus power from neighbors’ solar panels has actually decreased in recent months, according to one analysis.
Meanwhile, the amount of money utilities are paying for power from fossil fuel–fired plants and transmission represents a far bigger share of the electricity-bill bottom line.
“‘“
Maine Republican lawmakers this session have introduced four different bills calling for the repeal of net energy billing, the system that compensates utility customers for unused electricity they generate and share on the grid. Supporters of the bills have called the program
““
The hostility toward Maine’s net energy billing rules is part of a wave of efforts to blame rising power prices on clean-energy and energy-efficiency programs, particularly in New England. In Rhode Island and Maryland, legislators have called for cuts to fees supporting energy-efficiency and clean-energy programs. And Massachusetts regulators last week ordered $500
At a legislative committee hearing last week, Maine legislators testified that small-business owners will be forced to close their doors and low-income households put in dire financial straits by wealthy solar-panel owners imposing the cost of their renewable-energy choices onto everyone else. It is ““
## Looking at the evidence
The numbers tell a very different story, beginning with the actual dollars-and-cents impact of net energy billing on the average consumer.
Maine’s net energy billing program was expanded in 201920241500MW100MW2019
Statewide, costs attributed to net energy billing now make up a slightly smaller percentage of the average bill than they did in the latter half of 2024500640762706
So if it’s not the solar program, then what is causing utility bills to rise? One of the main forces driving electricity prices is the cost of energy supply in New England, more than half of which comes from natural gas–fired power plants. Volatility in the natural gas market, therefore, translates directly into higher electricity rates for consumers. Prices spiked in 2022202339
“
The other major contributor is rising transmission costs, which on average make up 51372023
There are some commercial cases in which the cost for net energy billing does have an outsized impact on energy bills, supporters of the incentive agree. Commercial power customers are charged a fixed rate based on the specific rate classification their business falls under. This system means some businesses end up with a much larger percentage of their bill paying for net energy billing.
At last week’s hearing, Sen. Stewart testified that potato processor Penobscot McCrum will pay close to $70000055
Supporters of net energy billing agree that situations such as these are unfair and unsustainable, and a docket is already underway with the state Public Utilities Commission to address that specific issue without repealing the entire net energy billing program, Donoghue said.
“
## Unseen savings
Net energy billing also provides benefits that are hard to see but which offset the costs, supporters said. In 2023130160“
More solar generation in the state means more Maine households are getting power produced in or near their communities, lowering the strain on the transmission and distribution systems — and the associated costs. Solar developers also pay for any infrastructure upgrades needed to accommodate their projects.
“
Furthermore, eliminating net energy billing would have its own financial consequences for the roughly 110000
Opponents in the legislature have passed three rounds of rollbacks to the program. Now they want to go even further.

The megabill passed by Republicans in Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last week creates many challenges for clean energy — enough to choke off lots of new solar and wind power projects, and cast uncertainty over everything from battery storage deployments to EV

Segue isn’t alone. Financiers and developers across the country are grappling with this as they consider whether to move forward with much of the hundreds of gigawatts of solar, battery, and wind projects being planned around the country.

## A ticking clock for clean energy investors
Developers ultimately have little control over when a project can connect to the grid and start delivering power. That’s why the most vital change in the final version of the bill is one pushed by Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), which gives wind and solar projects until July 42026
Projects that meet this deadline will be eligible as long as they’re completed and placed in service within four years of start of construction. Previous versions of the bill would have given those projects only 602028

The Senate proposed a version earlier in June that was less aggressive in its phaseout of clean-energy incentives, sparking hope that some Inflation Reduction Act provisions would be salvaged.

Vermont clean energy advocates are playing defense this year in Montpelier.
The Green Mountain State has long been a leader on clean energy, generating nearly all of its electricity from renewable sources since 2015
“
A new crop of Republican state lawmakers is taking aim at clean energy policy in the state, and while most of their bills are unlikely to pass in the Democratic-controlled Legislature, those backed by Republican Gov. Phil Scott are expected to get committee hearings. Meanwhile, Democrats have lost their legislative supermajorities, which means any legislation they pass will be vulnerable to a veto.
Gov. Scott, who stood up for climate action during the first Trump presidency, is striking a newly skeptical tone about the cost of clean energy programs and has announced his intent to roll back some provisions of state climate laws. As a backdrop to it all are growing concerns about energy price inflation that has caused some to falsely blame climate and clean energy policy for rising utility bills.

The bill would replace the state’s renewable energy requirements with a clean electricity standard that includes nuclear power.

## To avoid Gov. Scott’s veto pen, Democrats seek budget-neutral solutions
At the same time, Democrats — aware of Scott’s resistance to any clean energy action that comes with a price tag — have proposed just one major energy bill.

Democrats’ proposal would expand the mission of the state’s energy-efficiency utility, Efficiency Vermont, to include a broader range of emission-reducing and cost-saving solutions, including fuel switching and electric vehicle adoption. The program currently has a very narrow mandate to reduce the consumption of electricity. Bill
Johanna Miller, energy and climate program director for the Vermont Natural Resources Council, is hopeful, however, that Scott would not veto the measure, as it leverages existing money rather than adding cost.

The dynamics in the state have been building to this moment for some time. In addition to the cost-of-living concerns that are widespread nationally, Vermont last year dealt with a surge in property taxes to fund its schools.
Outside voices have started to creep into the state as well: In 2024
These circumstances have left Democrats and environmental advocates girding for two years of staving off attacks on clean energy and energy-efficiency programs while struggling to make much progress.

Well, it's difficult to keep up on new information, but this map needs to be updated. I just went over the areas in my state of Tennessee and saw that you show Lawrence County on the southern edge of our state having no public charger plugs. But a quick look at Plugshare shows that the county seat, Lawrenceburg, has 2 level 2 chargers at the Citizens Bank, and a little closer to the southern border of the state is a fast charging station at the Quik Mart in Leona. I think there are other rural areas in our state that are better equipped than you suggest. And what about other states? PlugShare is a readily available resource to up date this article which is dated yesterday.

Rep. Buddy Carter, the Republican congressman for Georgia’s 1st4
Julian Spector:
It’s an honor to have you here. We’re just kicking off our first live event in Washington, D.C. Everyone is into the energy scene — the technologies and the policies. I wanted to start by saying why we were so excited to have you here. You’re the Republican congressman from Georgia’s 1st
Buddy Carter:31
Spector:8EV
Carter: 76
As I say, $768500
Spector: 59
I’m from D.C., and I ended up going to college down in the South. (Go Blue Devils, figure that one out.) But sometimes, I think D.C. folks, we don’t always keep up with all the things happening in the South. There’s really a cluster of innovation and factories there. I was wondering if you could say, what has clean energy meant to the economy of Georgia, both in the manufacturing side and the installation of solar and battery projects?
Carter: 7
I also would be remiss if I did not mention the fact that Georgia is the first state to have nuclear reactors in the last 30
I’m a nuclear fan. Plant Vogtle is the largest clean energy plant in the United States. We added two reactors, reactors 3433
Spector: 1819
Carter: AP1000
We look forward to that because nuclear power is a big part of what we’re doing. We also have battery plants in the state of Georgia.
Georgia, for 111
Now let’s talk about affordability, because I think that’s an important thing to talk about as well. Yes, nuclear power is more expensive at this point, but I think it’s important to note that the difference between the cost of reactor No. 34
We learned a lot of things when we built reactor No. 34
Spector:
Speaking of the cost of energy, I think we can’t ignore there’s a little something going on in Washington this week, which is this big, beautiful budget. I was looking back over a letter you wrote with some of your colleagues from the Conservative Climate Caucus last summer, basically saying that prematurely repealing the energy tax credits, particularly those used to justify investments that already broke ground, could undermine private investment and stop development that’s already ongoing. And I think that applies both to factories that are trying to make things in America, and power plants, solar plants.
So, you voted for the budget bill. What happened between the argument you were making in that letter last summer and the bill that you ultimately voted for?
Carter:
In fact, I’ve signed three letters saying that we should not take a sledgehammer to the Inflation Reduction Act. Instead, we should take a scalpel, because I’ve always said, and I continue to say, if these policies result in stabilizing our supply chain or if they result in domestic manufacturing, why wouldn’t we look at them? Why wouldn’t we keep them? That’s Republican priorities anyway.
I want to share a quick story with you because I thought it was somewhat humorous. I was calling up a supporter. And, you know, I’m running statewide. I should have mentioned that I’m running for U.S. Senate in the next election.
I called up a potential supporter, and he was saying, “IRA
And I said, “
He responded: “IRA
Give me a break. Republican ideas, Democratic ideas. We do it all the time — we take things that the Democrats did, we claim them to be ours, and they do the same thing. They’re good ideas, and I think it’s important to note that. Some of these things did result in stabilizing the supply chain and in domestic manufacturing. Why wouldn’t we keep those things? Why wouldn’t we look at that? The Republicans want that just as much as the Democrats.
Now, having said that, let me make one thing clear: The decision to make the $76
Now, would they like to have the tax credits? Of course they would; any business would. But I think it is significant that we understand that decision was made. Let me assure you, as I have assured them, they made a wise decision. There’s going to be a market for EVs.
I’m one who strongly believes that the government shouldn’t be choosing winners and losers, because when the government chooses winners and losers, consumers lose. There’s going to be a market for EVs. It may not be in rural South Georgia, but eventually it will. I can assure you, in the urban areas, Hyundai is going to do great.
Spector:
Carter:
I think it ought to be market-driven. I don’t think the government should be telling people what kind of car to be driving or what kind of appliance you’re going to be using. I just don’t think that’s the role of the government.
Spector:
Carter:
The main thing is we’ve got to get these tax cuts extended. We have to make sure that we don’t have the largest tax increase in the history of the world.
We have companies coming into our office every day. They need stability. They need certainty in order to make investments. I understand that — I was in business for myself for 32
The government’s been run in the past few decades by executive orders. We’ve got to get away from that. Whether you’re Republican or Democrat, you ought to feel, if you’re a member of Congress, that the legislative branch has got to assert themselves and their authority as our forefathers intended for it to be.
I am trying to encourage some of these senators and, even still, some House members, because it’s going to come back to us.
I’m not going to mislead you. It’s a heavy lift. I think the biggest hurdle we’re trying to get over is in the Senate, and some of those who, first of all, feel like, you know, we didn’t address the debt. That’s not what we were doing this for. Does it need to be addressed? Obviously. I’m on the budget committee. Obviously it needs to be addressed. And don’t think that we can’t do another reconciliation package. We can do another one, and I would submit to you that we need to do a budget reconciliation package for debt reduction.
I’m chair of the health subcommittee. I’m a pharmacist by profession. Medicaid, Medicare — we need reforms in that, but not here. Keep the main thing the main thing, and the main thing is to get these tax cuts extended, because if we don’t, the impact it’s going to have on our economy is going to be devastating.
Spector: AI
After decades of pretty much flat demand for electricity, we’re now seeing pretty mind-blowing expectations of how much is going to be needed in the next few years. Solar is the thing that’s getting built the most across the country right now, and if the credits sort of shake up the investment landscape there, they’re saying it could jeopardize 60
Do you think your colleagues are grappling with that, a possibility that these cuts might actually undermine the president’s AI
Carter: AIAIAIAI
We understand now, to your point, the demand for energy. That’s why I’m an all-of-the-above type energy strategist, because we are going to need every electron we can get. We all know how much data centers in AI
To your point, yes, we’re going to need solar, we’re going to need wind, we’re going to need nuclear and its baseload reliability. Yes, we’re going to need it. We’re going to need every available electron.
All of you understand how important this is. We cannot afford to lose this race to China. We cannot afford to lose the AI
Spector: AI
Carter:
We had this tragedy in Fukushima, and I was able to go to Japan and see what happened there. Europe’s kind of abandoned nuclear energy, but I think they’re going back now. I know France, thank goodness, didn’t abandon it; they’re providing it for everyone. Nuclear is going to be a big part of it. We’re going to need everything. I am encouraging my colleagues to look at everything.
Spector:
Carter:
I have the honor and privilege of representing, as I said, the coast of Georgia. It’s where I’ve lived all my life and where I intend to live the rest of my life. Some of my fondest memories growing up are going fishing with my dad. I want my sons, I want my grandchildren, to have that same opportunity to enjoy those memories.
I love the environment. I’m not going to ever do anything intentionally to hurt the environment. I tell you, environmentalists are tough — you can be with 99901
My point is, it is important for us as Republicans to acknowledge, and I do believe. I believe in climate change. I believe that man has an impact on the climate and that we need to address it.
I believe that we should be looking toward cleaner energy and renewable energy. I do believe that. That’s why I’m cochair of the Conservative Climate Caucus. That’s why I work. That’s why I signed those three letters. That’s why I’m working diligently on this. I want us to do that, but at the same time, we’ve got to be careful not to cut our nose off in spite of our face. It needs to be an approach that is sensible and logical.
Spector:
Carter:
I’ll give you an example. I think this is relevant. As I said, I represent the city of Savannah. The Savannah Harbor expansion project, where we deepened our harbor from 42472022
The permitting — this is true — the permitting for that project started in 1996
In that period of time, China has started and completed three new ports. The point I’m trying to make here: We can do a better job than this without endangering our environment, and we need to do a better job. It doesn’t matter what part of our economy you’re talking about, there are people coming to my office and saying permitting is killing us.

Since 2017energy equity and green jobs programs.
Now, for the third time in under a decade, state lawmakers, advocates, and industry groups have their sights set on ensuring that clean energy momentum.
The focus this legislative session is the electric grid. Stakeholders worry the state’s clean energy progress will stagnate if it can’t expand and fortify its infrastructure for moving and storing electricity.
Advocates are backing a wide-ranging bill known as the CRGA20172021. Solar and energy-storage industries are backing another bill that includes even more ambitious goals for building out new transmission and energy storage.
There’s widespread agreement that Illinois’ current grid is not ready for the state’s mandated transition to 1002050proliferation of data centers in Illinois.

Stakeholders generally agree that new energy legislation is especially crucial given the Trump administration’s rollbacks to clean energy incentives and mandates.
“
## Study first
Illinois does not do the type of comprehensive planning for energy use and transmission that electric utilities do in states with vertically integrated energy markets. In Illinois, separate companies generate and transmit electricity, with the idea that the open market will match supply with demand. But experts say centralized planning is necessary to ensure that clean energy can meet the state’s needs.

CRGA
The bill also mandates public studies of the grid to determine where it is underutilized and how the latest technology could more efficiently move electrons around — increasing the grid’s capacity without building new wires.

## Transmission, storage, and efficiency
Last year, companies hoping to build new high-voltage transmission in Illinois backed a proposal for creating renewable energy credits to incentivize it, similar to those that helped Illinois grow its solar capacity manyfold to

The bill also greatly expands energy-efficiency mandates for the state’s electric and gas utilities. It increases the amount of energy savings that electric utilities are required to achieve each year to the equivalent of 2
Under the legislation, downstate utility Ameren would have to meet the same targets as Chicago-area utility ComEd, closing a gap between the utilities’ requirements. It would also more than double the savings mandates for natural gas utilities, and it would end the current ability of large industrial users to opt out of paying into a fund for energy efficiency.

To be sure, the data comes with a notable caveat. Heat pumps outsold gas furnaces, but that doesn’t necessarily mean more households are choosing heat pumps over gas heating; homes often need multiple heat-pump units to replace a single fossil fuel–fired appliance.
Still, heat pumps have clear momentum. In fact, the market has been RMI“
It’s not hard to see why. Electric heat pumps have massive comfort, climate, and health benefits. They’re essentially two-way air conditioners that can both heat and cool building interiors, are routinely three to four times as efficient as fossil-fuel systems, and are one of the most effective ways an individual can reduce their planet-warming pollution. In many cases, heat pumps can also save you money.
The building sector accounts for 2050rapidly make up 100, per modeling by electrification nonprofit Rewiring America.
Asked whether heat pump growth is strong enough to hit climate targets, Unger said, “
Still, ““““
Unger pointed out that consumers don’t change home heating appliances as frequently as cars, a nod to the recent growth of electric vehicle sales. Contractors are also apt to move cautiously because they want to be sure that a technology will work for their business model before committing to it.
A medley of factors are causing heat pump sales to grow, according to experts Canary Media spoke to. Firstly, consumers and contractors are gaining more familiarity with the tech and having better experiences, Unger said.
Advances in heat pump technology have made it well-suited to some of the coldest climes in the U.S. Just look to Maine; heat pumps proved so popular there that the wintry state blew past its 2025can work well below -22. And the tech’s performance keeps
Plus, many states and local jurisdictions are pushing hard for heat pumps.
In 202325 signed on to install 20203065new energy code also encourages builders to install heat pumps instead of gas heating. And the San Francisco Bay Area will make heat pumps the de facto choice when it bars new gas furnaces starting in 2029.
Federal and local incentives are also helping people afford heat pumps. Installation costs for these systems are on average
The Inflation Reduction Act, the most ambitious climate legislation in history, gave Americans state-distributed home energy rebates of up to $8000how long these incentives might last under the Trump administration is an open question.
Thanks to steady growth in heat pump sales thus far, the U.S. is now among the top countries quickly transitioning from oil and gas heating to heat pumps, said
What will it take to drive heat pump sales even higher in the U.S.? Stakeholders need to educate consumers and provide resources to make switching as easy and compelling as possible, said “

An army of conservative think tanks are lobbying for a stop-work order on U.S. offshore wind installations that are already under construction along the East Coast. But one of those groups is breaking ranks, refusing to endorse the demise of America’s largest project, off the Virginia coast.
The dissent reveals a chink in the armor of Republican opposition to wind, which has grown dramatically since President Donald Trump’s return to office.
At the heart of the disagreement is Dominion Energy’s 26781766
Under a hypothetical cancellation, the residents of Virginia could potentially have to pay for that abandoned investment in the form of higher utility bills, without getting anything in return.

The letter was signed by a half dozen conservation groups known for their far-right policy agendas, including the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, the Heartland Institute, the John Locke Foundation, and the Caesar Rodney Institute. A few anti-wind advocacy groups also signed on, including Green Oceans and REACT
Some of the think tanks, like the Delaware-based Caesar Rodney Institute, have ties to existing lawsuits aimed at stopping various offshore wind projects. Those complaints, filed against the federal government, contain similar claims found in Tuesday’s letter about “
None of these lawsuits led by GOP
Haner said that the Thomas Jefferson Institute declined to participate in those lawsuits.

Besides, he added, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, endorses the Dominion project, too.
The Thomas Jefferson Institute has previously aligned with the Caesar Rodney Institute on anti-wind lobbying and has teamed up with other members of the conservation coalition known as the State Policy Network, which promotes far-right policies favored by Trump.

Stevenson believes that the federal government could somehow reimburse ratepayers for any sunk costs left by a federally mandated cancellation of projects. There’s little precedent for such an outcome. In fact, historically, ratepayers have had to bear the financial burden when a project goes awry.
For example, South Carolina residents are still paying for a nuclear power plant that was never completed. Construction on the infamous V.C. Summer nuclear project ceased in 20179
Haner used to hate the idea of offshore wind coming to his home state. The high upfront costs of construction made little sense to him.

Maryland just passed a raft of energy legislation designed to curb rising utility bills and boost in-state power generation. The reaction from climate advocates was mixed.
On the one hand, advocates lauded steps to limit gas infrastructure investments, streamline the community solar build-out, install more battery storage, and remove renewable-energy subsidies for trash incinerators.
But they’re also wary of recently passed legislation that expedites new gas and nuclear power plants. Environmental groups had pushed back on those measures, arguing the energy sources could raise costs for consumers and run counter to the state’s ambitious climate goals.

The three energy bills passed Monday are now headed to Democratic Gov. Wes Moore’s desk for signing. The largest is the

Today, Honorable is ready to start a new chapter, having graduated with honors last week from a clean energy workforce training program at Richland Community College, located in the Central Illinois city of Decatur. He would eventually like to own or manage a solar company, but he has more immediate plans to start a solar-powered mobile hot dog stand. He’s already chosen the name: Buns on the Run.

After decades of layoffs and factory closings, the community of Decatur is also looking to clean energy as a potential springboard.
Located amid soybean fields a three-hour drive from Chicago, the city was long known for its Caterpillar, Firestone Tire, and massive corn-syrup factories. Industrial jobs have been in decline for decades, though, and high rates of gun violence, child poverty, unemployment, and incarceration were among the reasons the city was named a clean energy workforce hub funded under Illinois’ 2021CEJA

## Getting students ready for the clean energy workforce
Richland Community College’s clean energy jobs training starts with an eight-week life skills course that has long been central to the larger EnRich program. The course uses a Circle of Courage practice inspired by Indigenous communities and helps students prepare to handle stressful workplace situations like being disrespected or even called a racial slur.

The training addresses other dynamics that might be unfamiliar to some students — for example, some male students might not be prepared to be supervised by a woman, Carson noted, or others might not be comfortable with LGBTQ

A first-of-its-kind pilot to electrify homes on Cape Cod and Martha’s Vineyard is set to finish construction in the coming weeks — and it could offer a blueprint for decarbonizing low- and moderate-income households in Massachusetts and beyond.
The Cape and Vineyard Electrification Offering is designed to be a turnkey program that makes it financially feasible and logistically approachable for households of all income levels to adopt solar panels, heat pumps, and batteries, and to realize the amplified benefits of using the resources together. These technologies slash emissions, reduce utility bills, and increase a home’s resilience during power outages, but are often only adopted by wealthier households due to their upfront cost.
“
In total, the program is providing free or heavily subsidized solar panels and heat pumps to 5512
““
It’s a strategy that program planners hope can help address the disproportionate energy burden felt by lower-income residents of the region, where households making less than one-third of the area median income spent an average of 272023
The initiative is a project of the Cape Light Compact, a unique regional organization that negotiates electric supply prices and administers energy-efficiency programming for the 212018202020212023the green light.
An energy-efficiency contractor partners with each program participant to assess their home, then coordinates the necessary work, including any preparations that need to be completed before solar panels, heat pumps, or batteries can be put in. The batteries installed through the program are enrolled in ConnectedSolutions, a state program that pays battery owners who send power to the grid when needed. Because the pilot footed the bill for the batteries, these payments will go to the Cape Light Compact, rather than residents, to help defray the cost of the program.
Bringing the program to life was not always a smooth process. The original proposal called for 100
In some cases, homeowners balked at up-front costs. Moderate-income households that did not live in deed-restricted affordable housing had to pay 2015000
“
The original plan called for installing batteries in 25
The compact also had not fully accounted for the array of barriers that needed to be addressed before weatherization could be done. Some homes had mold or needed electrical upgrades. Others required roof work before solar panels could be installed.
These challenges are not dealbreakers but lessons learned for utilities or organizations that attempt to emulate the program in the future, McCloskey said. And Olinsky-Paul sees great potential for similar plans to be pursued nationwide. Nearly half of U.S. states have adopted 100electrification can create for the grid.
““
The Cape Light Compact intends to release a full report on the deployment of the pilot in August, but feedback so far has been very positive from participants who appreciate the turnkey approach to comprehensive electrification, McCloskey said.

Sounds interesting, but the article doesn't discuss actual costs at all. 55 homes is one thing. A whole town, or city, quite another. Is it costing the folks footing the bill (not the home owners), $10,000 a home, $50K a home, or a whole lot more. Also what has been the timeframe from contact with the home owner and completion of the job. As the article points out, each home may have different issues - no basements, old electrical panels and wiring roofs needing reinforcement, or just repairs. How much time does it take from start to completion - a range, covering all 55 homes? Is this another super expensive project that governments have to pay for, or is there a reasonable cost basis to this.
I note that these homes are selling their electric to the utility. But as we see in most states with big solar pushes to put solar on roofs, ie CA, after a while the utilities can no longer afford to pay retail rates to homes providing electric back at peak times. That's why in CA new solar installations are falling off a cliff while existing home owners with solar are adding batteries (a good thing). Still, while we are upgrading a few homes, the norm because the utility is paying far more for residential electric buys than wholesale electric from power plants, etc, increases the share of the utility bill paid for by folks that can't afford solar, et al.
A follow up article that answers some of these questions would make this program something to consider, or abandon, but without details it just sounds like another experiment, more likely than not, to fail, due to costs.
So how about a good follow up piece? thanks

This was originally published by The Texas Tribune.
When Texas legislators conceived of the Texas Energy Fund in the spring of 2023
In the two years since that vote, however, experts say the energy market has turned against the development of gas-fired power plants. Experts and energy companies say the fund’s $72

Only two new proposals have been approved so far through the TEF20332172
Together, the plants would have a capacity to generate 578625002030

But of the 25
The most recent company to withdraw an application, Hunt Energy Network, cited the cost-effectiveness of constructing a natural gas power plant under the loan program as the reason for its withdrawal,
## Winter storm sparked loan fund
The fund was created in the wake of Winter Storm Uri, the February 2021
Gov. Greg Abbott and other Republican leaders were quick to blame trouble with wind and solar power generation for the power outages. While renewables did struggle to generate electricity in the frigid temperatures, so did natural gas power generation after power plant equipment and some pipelines that supply gas to the plants froze.
After that disaster, lawmakers argued that the state needed more on-demand power — specifically natural gas power plants — that doesn’t require wind and sun to generate electricity. They started the Texas Energy Fund with an initial $5528
But since 2023
Energy demand is rising globally due to the construction of new data centers for artificial intelligence, and many regions are turning to natural gas power because of its relative affordability, lower emissions compared to coal, and its ability to operate at all times of the day, unlike wind and solar.
That demand is straining the supply chain for turbines, specialized equipment used in power plants that cost tens of millions of dollars. Wait times on orders for the machinery have
A turbine order placed today likely would not arrive before 2029
At the same time, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the state’s power grid operator, is predicting energy demand in the state will double by 2030AI
The state is on course to meet those electricity demands, but largely through advancements in solar technology and battery storage, which are significantly cheaper than natural gas power plants to install. In Texas’ deregulated energy market, which gives preference to the least-expensive power, this takes away the forecast market share available to companies hoping to profit from a new natural gas power plant, meaning the plants cost more to install and are likely to make less money over time, said Dennis Wamsted, an energy analyst with the nonprofit Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Sun Day is a revival of an historic national event that your readership needs to know about. Sun Day is May 3, 1978! That was the news of its day. There were events nationwide. In Chicago, we marched and filled Chicago's Federal Plaza. Lots of people remember that Pres. Carter had solar thermal put on the White House, but few now recall that everyone from utilities to college kids, social equity activists, homebuilders, teachers, UAW and AFL-CIO came out! Amory Lovins (young wizard) spoke in Chicago at one of the major banks. Why is this important to remember? Because IT WORKED! The seeds were sown. Enjoy Sun Day 2025, and see if you can beat our historic best!

Great article, but the first ""SunDay"" celebration was on May 3, 1978. It was designated by President Carter and a joint resolution of Congress. It was the idea of Denis Hayes, who also coordinated Earth Day in 1970. It was also celebrated internationally by dozens of other countries. Glad Bill McKibben is keeping the torch burning.

Startup Quaise began yard tests of its rock-melting energy beam in January, clearing the way for field tests that will dig into the earth. (Quaise)
One recent day in a warehouse south of downtown Houston, I got a peek at something that just might revolutionize the clean energy transition: a molten orange puddle of instantly liquefied rock.
Moments before, an attendant loaded a slug of basalt under a metal-frame structure that looked like something a supervillain might point at a tied-up James Bond, and I was ushered behind a protective barrier. An order went out, the contraption began to whir, and we turned our focus to a TV
One mustn’t believe everything that appears on a screen, but then Carlos Araque, CEO2000
The flashy demonstration was just one example of how startups are looking to revolutionize geothermal energy production. The U.S. built its 1960044solar and battery capacity Texas installs in four months these days.
The way out of this decades-long malaise may simply be down. The more subterranean heat a geothermal plant can access, the more energy it can generate, and the Earth gets hotter closer to the core. But the intense conditions below a few miles deep rapidly wreck conventional drill bits.
Araque figured that if he could build a strong enough drill bit, it could harness this super-deep heat and deliver cheap, clean, and abundant geothermal power, pretty much anywhere.
So he left a career in oilfield drilling and formed Quaise in 2018
![](

Araque likened the technology to the familiar microwave oven, which heats food by zapping it with a particular band of electromagnetic waves that excites water molecules.
““
He first pitched me on his super-powered drill bit six years ago. At the time, it all sounded like science fiction, something that Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers might study and venture capitalists might take a flyer on but that wouldn’t materialize as real technology.
In fact, Quaise did spin out of an MIT100
Still, Quaise has plenty more work to do before it can deliver its transformative promise — and that starts with getting out of the lab and into the field.
## Field tests of rock-melting beam to begin in Houston and Austin, Texas
By the time I visited in late January, Quaise had been melting rock outside of the lab but on its own property for weeks. I personally witnessed rock-melting in two places: in the hangar, with a drill rig pointing the millimeter-wave beam at a target rock, and in the yard, where a contraption mounted on tank treads blasted into a rock sample placed in a concrete receptacle on the ground.
“
These tests are necessary to calibrate the novel combination of millimeter-wave emitter and conventional oil-drilling rig. (The Quaise founders know their way around that world, having come from drilling powerhouse Schlumberger.) Quaise proved it can transmit the waves while moving the device, something that the nuclear fusion folks never needed to test. The company’s “
![]( Canary Media's Julian Spector conferred with Quaise CEO Carlos Araque on the grounds of Quaise's Houston facility. (Lisa Hymas)
The tests so far amount to the karate demonstration where someone chops through a stack of two-by-fours: Most impressive but not a commercially viable way to chop wood. The next step is obvious — Quaise needs to get out and drill into the earth. That’s coming soon.
Quaise obtained a test site in north Houston where it can drill up to 100100182
Soon after, Quaise will swap that out for a new 1108

## New geothermal power plants coming soon
If and when the time comes to drill for actual power plants, Quaise aims to ride conventional drilling technologies as far as they’ll go. The plan is to hire traditional rigs to burrow through the first 232
After hitting basement rock, Quaise will swap drill bits for its millimeter-wave drill and blast to about 5
Quaise leaders did not disclose a timeline for the company’s first commercial deep drilling. At that point, Quaise will need to build an actual power plant and navigate the myriad permitting and transmission-connection hurdles that face renewables developers broadly. The company is running this development process in-house and already has multiple geothermal leases secured, a spokesperson noted.
In the meantime, a handful of other startups are making headway on commercial-scale geothermal plants, albeit with different approaches.
Fervo Energy has applied fracking technologies to geothermal drilling to make the process more efficient; after a successful 35 in Nevada, the company began drilling the 400
Closer in principle to Quaise, a Canadian startup called Eavor is developing ways to drill deeper than was economically practical before. Instead of reinventing the drill itself, Eavor defends it with insulation and “
“180 temperatures, [but Eavor’s] insulated drilling pipe has a cooling effect on the tools making them work at even higher temperatures just by insulating the pipe,” a company spokesperson said in an email.
Eavor notched a big win in 2023342508264
Taken together, geothermal innovators like Quaise, along with the somewhat less science-fictiony enhanced geothermal startups like Fervo and Eavor, could produce the “
““
Quaise could in theory supply those other geothermal innovators with a better type of drill to extend their range. But Araque insisted Quaise wants to be in the power generation business, not the widget business.
The company also has to manage an evident chokepoint in its development: those highly specialized gyrotrons. Quaise owns four, Araque said; the global gyrotron supply chain currently can’t handle an order for 10
The work to extend from boring a few inches of rock to miles of it should not be underestimated, but Quaise has already crossed the more daunting chasm from never melting rock with an energy beam to doing so daily.

Information I gleaned back about 2022 said Quaise was going to drill a 330-foot deep well in New Mexico, and with Alta Rock Energy (Seattle), a 3,300-foot-well at the Newberry Volcano in Central Oregon. They had hoped to have a power plant running there by 2026. Obviously they are behind that schedule. Can you provide an updated timeline?

While China leads the world in both the production and adoption of clean energy tech like solar and EVs, the country has been slower to tackle decarbonizing heavy industry. That is starting to change.
In July, the Chinese state-owned steelmaker HBIS10000
Meanwhile, in the U.S., steel producers are backing away from earlier commitments to produce green steel. Just before President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, the Swedish steelmaker SSABpulled out of negotiations for $500abandoned its own green steel effort in Middletown, Ohio, after the Trump administration pressed the steelmaker to use a $50015reputation as a “

## What kind of green steel is China making – and how much?
China produces a staggering amount of steel each year — more than 19010
China has yet to widely implement the technology known as direct reduction of iron, or DRIDRI
China has many small-scale pilot projects manufacturing steel with hydrogen, but most involve minimal volumes of the material. For example, the country’s No. 2DRIHBISHBIS
How clean the hydrogen is that China uses to make steel is a complicated question.
Hydrogen – the smallest molecule – is already widely used in industrial processes and offers a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels since it produces no carbon dioxide when burned. Yet the vast majority of the global supply of hydrogen is made through methods that use fossil fuels and generate planet-heating emissions. When made with electrolyzers powered by renewable energy, hydrogen produces almost no emissions at all, but production of this form – green hydrogen – is nascent and comes at a high premium. (DRI

It’s unclear how much of the steel HBISHBIS
But David Fishman, a principal at the Shanghai-based energy consultancy The Lantau Group, said “HBISHBIS2023
The export deal may be a sign of China raising its ambitions for cleaner steel. The national government had set a target for 1510
Part of the problem is that provincial steel targets are at odds with the policies set in Beijing. Though the national government opened China to imported scrap steel that could be used in EAFs, imports halved in 2024
But if China can deepen its stockpiles of scrap steel, the country could more quickly build out a lower-carbon steel industry using EAFs while it waits to improve technology on green hydrogen that can bring down costs of fully decarbonized steel, Shen said.

The bottleneck, she said, is “DRI

Whether policies that direct renewable power away from the grid benefit hydrogen producers by making that power more available to them depends on the provincial-level strategies for the fuel, which vary, Shen said.

I guess I've lost track of what the concept of fair and balanced reporting looks like. But I can tell you I am tired of the constant parade of articles that praise China for renewable development when they have built more coal in the past 10 years than the US has ever used. The emissions produced from this coal generation in China swamps the almost the entire world use of coal at this point, but let's make sure we continue to praise China for renewable development as the continue to add 50,000 MW of new coal production each year. Makes perfect sense to not present the facts about what they are doing versus talking about the fact that we've all but eliminated coal in our energy production stack and reduced the electric industry's emission profile by more than 60% in the past 25 years while China's environmental emissions are increasing exponentially year over year. But congratulations to China for building a little bit of wind and solar and producing green steel. Keep shotting those BB's at the elephant issue of your coal emissions that continue to exponentially increase.

Re Chris Hickman's comment: ""But congratulations to China for building a little bit of wind and solar ...."" Are you unaware that China has installed more wind and solar generation capacity than the rest of the world out together for three years running? That's not ""a little bit"". I do not belittle their enormous CO2 emissions, although they were lower in the first half of 2025 than the first half of 2024. A large part of those emissions are to make goods for developed countries like ourselves. Just about every manufactured item I see in the shops was ""made in China"". But the emissions associated with their manufacture also happen in China, whereas they should be attributed to importing countries. The best thing developed countries can do is to stop buying their manufactured goods and make them at home or at least on the same continent.

Good article, thx. i m o , the situation will change with an emission cap based emissions trading system in China, as opposed to the current emission-intensity based system, which is leading to only very moderate progress on the emission side. Rumour has it, that such a cap will come ~~ 2030. When it's there, the price for high-emissions steel will go up within China as well and a clear incentive for low emission steel plants will be there. (Plus, EUs CBAM will put a lesser import tariff on CHN steel.) Also, low carbon H2 can be produced with NG and CCS. I don't know whether China is exploring this path - might yield cheaper low - carbon steel, if working one day.

Canary Media’s Electrified Life column shares real-world tales, tips, and insights to demystify what individuals can do to shift their homes and lives to clean electric power.
Micah Parkin wanted to quash her home’s carbon pollution to help fight climate change. So she took a familiar step among climate-inclined homeowners: She got a heat pump — just not the typical variety.
Her heat pump pulls warmth from the ground, rather than the air, and the appliance “350“
Heat pumps, whatever their heat source, are critical for decarbonizing space and water heating, which accounts for can save homeowners money and is guaranteed to have health benefits given the toxic pollutants fossil-fuel systems emit.
Ground-source, or geothermal, heat pumps have a superpower over the much more common air-based systems: efficiency. While air-source heat pumps can perform two to three times as efficiently as fossil-fuel systems in cold weather, ground-source heat pumps can perform about twice as efficiently again
That efficiency is what won Parkin over. She has a 7“
But for all their efficiency gains, geothermal heat pumps have one big thing holding them back: They cost roughly double to install compared with air-source systems.
Out of 123513113are outselling fossil-gas furnaces by a wider margin than ever.
The DOE72035
“10DOE
The benefits could be enormous not only for the homeowners involved but for the power system overall. Geothermal heat pumps are way less of a burden on the grid due to their efficiency, the report found — enough to net roughly $4
Could geothermal heat pumps, with their unrivaled efficiency and grid and climate advantages, be a good fit for you? Let’s dig into the details of this clean-heating tech.
## How geothermal heat pumps work
Ground-source heat pumps, also called geo-exchange, earth-coupled, and earth-energy heat pumps, are so efficient because they tap heat where it’s steady and abundant: underground.
The appliances connect to flexible plastic pipes that delve into the earth. These ground loops, laid horizontally in trenches less than 10100mini-splits, or radiators.
Drawing heat from underground is a winning strategy because the shallow earth stays at a fairly constant temperature of somewhere between
Some geothermal heat pumps draw energy from water bodies, rather than the ground, through a similar process.
!Diagram of home with geothermal heat pump drawing heat from 50˚F ground instead of -20˚F air. How ground-source heat pumps work in the winter and the summer. (Dandelion Energy)
Another selling point for ground-source heat pumps is their longevity. The heat pump unit itself has a slightly better average lifespan — around DOE50home-geothermal company and spinout from X, Google’s “
Ground-source heat pumps can also simplify some aspects of installation, Hannun said. Dandelion
## How much do ground-source heat pumps cost?
The reason ground-source heat pumps tend to be much more expensive upfront is their drilling costs.
On average and before incentives, air-source heat-pump systems cost $12000200002500040000
The typical payback period for home systems ranges from 310
A big factor affecting installation costs is the physical environment. ““5000“
But if you’re in a dense residential neighborhood where labor costs are high, and you use a lot of heat in the winter, “20000
The good news is that costs are coming down, Hannun pointed out. Dandelion has gotten better at taking geology into account; a home on bedrock, a great thermal conductor, doesn’t need as much ground loop as a similar home on clay. And the company has moved from water-well drilling rigs to more-compact ones that can be operated by fewer people, she said. Today, drilling costs are about two-thirds of what they were when the company started in 2017
The beloved TV2019
Reducing a home’s heating demands by weatherizing it first can help you spend less on a heat pump and energy bills, whether you choose an air-source or ground-source system.
## Incentives for geothermal heat pumps
Homeowners can take advantage of thousands of dollars in tax credits and rebates from the federal government, states, and utilities to get ground-source heat pumps.
The biggest incentive is the federal 25 after its section of the tax code. Offering 3025 is uncapped. By contrast, 25, is limited to $2000
The 25 tax credit first took effect in 200820222032killing the IRA.
Even if Congress does repeal the tax credit, homeowners should still be able to claim the credit next year as long as they have finished installing their ground-source heat pump systems while 25 is still on the books, according to “
Generous, even enormous incentives can also be found elsewhere, especially in the Northeast with its cold winters and a legacy of expensive fuel-oil systems. New York offers a 2500035000
Check with reputable contractors about what financial help you can get, and search the
If you’re considering geothermal heat pumps, look for experienced contractors who will calculate the heat load of your home to accurately size the system. Ask about the projected total lifetime cost; it could be lower for a geothermal heat pump than for an air-source system because of its low operating costs, especially after incentives. And as with any major home project, get multiple quotes.
Geothermal heat pumps are the most efficient home-heating systems available. But only you can decide whether they make sense for you, your goals, and your budget.

It would be interesting to see a breakdown of ""Air-source heat pumps... are outselling fossil-gas furnaces by a wider margin than ever."" I suspect a fair percentage of heat pumps that are being sold are just being used for air conditioning instead of heating. It would be great if they are replacing furnaces though.
Either way, higher heat pump volumes should drive down equipment and install costs.

I went thru this mental struggle a few years ago, ground based vs. atmosphere based. Lots to consider. My conclusion? If my case was a new build, geothermal is the choice, hands down. Drilling rig is already going to be making a visit for the well, the inside equipment has no existing space competition in the basement, so life disruption is non existent. As a retrofit into my existing house? The future state looks attractive, but getting there would be so disruptive, time consuming, and expensive. And in my location, the higher efficiency air based heat pumps are just as energy efficient. Your property may be different, but for me? I gave up the geothermal dream, and spent the money on solar generation and batteries.

Massachusetts has for years been at the forefront of efforts to transition away from natural gas. In December 202320502023
Last week’s decision on who should pay for gas-line extensions is the latest effort to turn those principles into practice.
Under the old rules, a new customer that wants to hook up their building to gas generally does not have to pay out of pocket: The cost is spread out among all the utility’s customers over the course of several years on the assumption that the newcomer’s future fuel use will create enough revenue to cover the initial price, a practice known as “20239000160
““
In their ruling last week, Massachusetts’ regulators agreed with this stance and also declared that the existing approach runs counter to the state’s climate goals by encouraging greater adoption of natural gas. Plus, they said, the current system increases the chance that customers will be left paying for unneeded infrastructure, as more homes and businesses leave the gas system for electricity.

Not true. The gas line ends 100 yards down the street, and the 15 houses that don't have service were told by the gas utility years ago it would cost five figures per household plus a minimum usage annually to get service hooked up.
Perhaps there was a light passing the cost around subsidy, but the article's statement that that there was no out-of-pocket costs for hookup is uncategorically false

The U.S. faces a looming crisis as new data centers, factories, and broader economic growth cause electricity demand to rise faster than supply is forecast to grow.
Solar, wind, and batteries have made up more than 90 built in recent years, and are the only resources that can be constructed rapidly enough to meet surging demand in the near term. Other energy resources have far slower development times, including fossil-gas power plants, which currently face manufacturing bottlenecks that will take years to resolve.
In addition to headwinds from Trump and the GOP-led Congress, which just eliminated federal tax credits for solar and wind, the main factor that threatens to hold back clean-energy development is a lack of space on the grid.
The U.S. lags in building the new high-voltage transmission lines that grid experts say are necessary to bring even more new solar, wind, and batteries online. These lines carry clean power from where it’s cheap to produce to where the most energy is consumed, like cities, and building more of them can reduce grid congestion, improve power system reliability, and lower electricity rates.

Perhaps the Trump energy strategy is to build a new series of super-polluting coal-based mini-grids to power the AI and Crypto facilities, placing them in formerly occupied government buildings, where they can ruin the health and shorten the lives of people living in democrat voting cities.
The question is, who can we thank for this kind of brilliantly evil thinking. As to breaking contracts, that has always been a DJT specialty.

The first passenger terminal for air travel in the U.S. was an Art Deco celebration of aviation. In 1935
Now an administrative center called Building One, the former terminal has made history for a new reason: It’s the first edifice owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a bistate transportation agency, to undergo an all-electric retrofit.

Buildings account for a whopping
Retrofitting any existing structure is going to be tougher than going with all-electric systems from the start. But engineers looking to upgrade historic buildings are doubly constrained by the need to maintain their charges’ distinctive architectural features; you can’t just tear down the walls of a landmark.
The Port Authority’s Building One is an early example demonstrating that storied buildings can be electrified — all while keeping their vaunted status intact.

The team also swapped the building’s gas boilers with electric-resistance ones. Operating with the same physics as big electric tea kettles, these provide an extra boost as needed to the building’s water-based heating system. Pietrocola had considered using heat-pump boilers instead, which can be twice as efficient because they move heat instead of making it, but he nixed the idea because it would’ve meant replacing the hydronic system’s distribution pipes with bigger ones.

The Port Authority didn’t use any incentives to cover the expenses, in part because the team needed to act quickly to replace the building’s worn-out systems. But consumer credits for heat pumps, EVs, and other clean energy tech, the

Pietrocola plans to apply the lessons learned at Building One to other Port Authority structures as their fossil-fueled systems age out, he said. He’ll approach each project with a fresh eye to the building’s particular needs and the technology available. Next time, he added, the agency may go with hydronic heat pumps instead of the electric-resistance boilers.

That’s nearly double the amount built over the previous five-year period, which was in turn more than double the amount built across the five years before that. Put differently, the growth has essentially been exponential.
Solar is the driving force behind this expansion, which is key to transitioning the world away from planet-warming fossil fuels. It accounts for more than three-quarters of the expected increase in renewables between 20252030IEA
This solar boom will be almost equally split between utility-scale installations and distributed projects, meaning panels atop roofs or shade structures in parking lots, for example. Just over 2TW15TWIEA
China is installing most of the world’s solar, but the technology is a global phenomenon at this point. At least 2910
Other types of clean energy are set to grow, too, just not at anything close to solar’s scale.

There is NO question that renewable energy is a huge plus. The fossil fuel industry continues to downplay renewable energy because that industry KNOWS what is going to happen to them. The use of fossil fuels MUST be lessened to keep the planet habitable. We had an 11 kw solar array installed in 2020, and have never looked back. We have lessened our need for utility hydro by 85% and make more power per annum than the house uses. We are net metered, and the extra costs for delivery and tax are really the only reason we even have a bill!

Hundreds of business people, policy analysts, and conservative advocates filled a downtown Cleveland conference hall last week for the National Conservative Energy Summit. One major theme: the need for both the federal and local governments to remove increasingly high hurdles to building renewable energy.
“CEO
The group, which cohosted the program with the Ohio Conservative Energy Forum, has a mission “
The Trump administration has taken a more single-minded approach to energy.
Since January, it has promoted more fossil-fuel use and stalled the retirement of aging power plants. At the same time, it has rescinded grants and loans for clean energy projects; eliminated tax credits for wind, solar, EVs, and home-energy upgrades; and even halted construction on some offshore wind projects.
““
As President Donald Trump attacks clean energy at the federal level, some states like Colorado and Maine are pushing to speed up deployment. But in general, state and local laws that restrict renewable energy development are 1645040
Speaking at the conference, Jenifer French, chair of Ohio’s Power Siting Board and its Public Utilities Commission, noted that approximately 30202152public interest in several cases where bans didn’t apply but where local governments unanimously opposed the proposals.
Asked for her advice to developers, French said, “
Companies often hear such suggestions, but “
No matter how many community meetings are held, some people will still fight projects, putting pressure on local officials who may not have expertise in energy issues, he noted.
The deference to local governments creates a slippery slope, said Amanda Stallings, senior policy manager for clean-energy developer Geronimo Power, who also spoke on the panel. In her view, the states that pile on restrictive policies will not only see less investment from solar and wind developers, but will also discourage other industries from moving in.
Constraints on renewables also tread on landowners’ property rights, Stallings said, pointing out that in some cases a local government tells farmers not to use their land for solar but would have no problem with a housing development.
“
Meanwhile, “ISOwarned of potential reliability issues from delaying Revolution Wind, a nearly finished offshore project that the Trump administration has halted for now.
This past spring, Ohio managed to pass bipartisan legislation that is expected to help the state build more energy — both renewable and fossil-fueled — in large part because the law doesn’t pick winners, according to state Rep. Tristan Rader, D-Lakewood.
Speaking on a panel about the new law, Rader called it a big step but emphasized that the state still has barriers to getting additional renewable energy on the grid.

For one thing, the Ohio Senate removed provisions from HB15
Beyond that, the law left SB52tripled by a last-minute addition to a 2014

A handful of school buses in northern Illinois will soon have a new summer job.
ComEd is the latest utility to explore whether electric school buses could help manage the grid when school is out of session and air conditioners are humming.
Under such vehicle-to-grid, or V2G, electric school buses charge up at night when power is cheap and plentiful, then discharge electricity to the grid when local power demand is high. This infusion can alleviate the need to fire up natural gas peaker plants, buy expensive power on the market, or even build new power plants.
The buses basically act as batteries attached to the grid, in a win-win situation where school districts are paid for the service and utilities get power that is cheaper and possibly cleaner than what they could otherwise acquire during peak hours.

Greenlane held a ribbon cutting for its first large-scale electric vehicle charging depot in Colton, California, in April 2025. (Greenlane)
It’s a tough time for electric trucking in the U.S. The Trump administration has cut off funding for heavy-duty vehicle charging and port infrastructure. Republicans in Congress are trying to rescind states’ authority to set clean vehicle mandates. And tariffs are throttling incoming cargoes to U.S. ports, hampering the business of trucking as a whole while likely also driving up the already-high price of battery-powered trucks.
But in Southern California, the transition away from diesel trucks, which emit a disproportionate share of the transportation sector’s planet-warming and health-harming emissions, is moving forward despite federal policy obstacles. Two big all-electric charging depots opened in April to serve clean trucks operating in the region, which is home to the busiest seaport complex in the country and is the epicenter of U.S. electric truck adoption.
The first, located in Rancho Dominguez, 12startup with more than $1 in capital and that is working with a 720125
The 601240029“18010
These facilities are the latest in a line of big truck-charging depots springing up across California, built by major firms like logistics operators like Prologis, and startups including Forum Mobility, Voltera, and WattEV. This proliferation is in response to the state’s ambitious truck electrification goals, which include a target for completely zero-emissions fleets by 2045
Terawatt’s and Greenlane’s newly opened electric truck stops represent a new class of charging site meant to serve the next phase in the Southern California electric truck charging evolution.
Early truck-charging sites were designed to serve shorter-range trucks that deliver goods from a central warehouse before returning to recharge overnight. But Terawatt’s and Greenlane’s new depots are meant to function more like a classic highway stop for battery-powered trucks looking to deliver goods hundreds of miles away.
The new stations will support more routes per day from Southern California’s crowded ports to its distribution warehouses further inland, said Emilia Sibley, lead of Terawatt’s heavy-duty business unit. Terawatt’s newly opened site, which serves the trucks of customers ranging from relatively small freight haulers like ““
This infrastructure will allow truck owners to “
The same dynamic applies to electric trucks looking for a recharge at the end of delivery routes in the farther reaches of the Inland Empire, said Andrea Pratt, Greenlane’s vice president of government and utility relations. Unlike most truck-charging depots today, Greenlane’s Colton site is open to any electric truck, in the traditional ““
These big new charging depots are also the launchpads for a broader eastward expansion of truck-charging capacity. Greenlane’s Colton site is the first of a string of electric truck stops being planned from Long Beach to the Mojave Desert cities of Barstow and Baker as part of its
The routes and use cases open to electric trucks will further expand as the next generation of longer-range trucks from mainstream manufacturers and those from all-electric specialists like 2026
“
Both Greenlane’s and Terawatt’s new charging depots also offer fancier versions of the typical truck stop amenities, such as a lounge area with food and drink for sale, restrooms, free Wi-Fi, and round-the-clock security and customer support. Those are important both for on-the-go truckers spending a half hour to an hour to top up their batteries for the next leg of their journey and for trucks reserving bobtail spots to recharge overnight.
““
## The risks and rewards of building truck-charging depots
This build-it-and-they-will-come approach to electric trucking comes with its fair share of financial risk — particularly in the shadow of the second Trump administration.
The administration has frozen or restricted billions of dollars in grant funding authorized by Congress in the 20212022for building charging infrastructure on major transit corridors and
The Trump administration Advanced Clean Fleets mandate, which set statewide zero-emissions truck purchasing quotas on most large truck fleets.
Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress 10
Economic troubles are compounding the regulatory uncertainty. President Donald Trump’s crushingly high tariffs imposed on China have led to a major reduction in cargo being shipped to U.S. ports, any
Those tariffs will also drive up the cost of lithium-ion batteries, most of which are made in China today. Battery costs are the biggest reason why electric trucks remain
These headwinds further complicate the inherently uncertain economics of electric truck charging. Companies like Greenlane and Terawatt do have some levers to pull to secure demand for the charging infrastructure they’re building, however.
While Greenlane is opening its Colton chargers to all users, “100
Nevoya cofounder and Chief Commercial Officer John Verdon said the startup is working directly with “

It will take some careful planning to expand charging at the proper pace and scale to match the trucking industry’s demand for electrifying its fleet. “

Small electric appliances have long been an entry point for at-home coffee roasting, which like other craft hobbies saw an uptick during the pandemic. Almost all commercial roasting today, however, happens in gas-powered machines, which tend to come with more scale and precision — and greenhouse gas emissions — compared to electric options.
A trend toward electric coffee roasting has been percolating for years, though, and COVID-era coffee tinkerers like Whitney are helping to pique interest in electric roasting technology. Manufacturers are betting on an electric future, too, rolling out larger and smarter electric roasting machines aimed at competing with gas on quality and convenience, as well as providing climate benefits.
As Whitney’s hobby grew into a side business, he and his partner Nicole Bolea were determined to minimize their climate impact and saw electrification as the best way to do that. “
They founded 2022130
At one point Bolea, a chemical engineer by trade, began to seriously explore a system for capturing carbon emissions if they had to resort to a gas roaster in order to grow the business. Then, after a flurry of searches and cold emails, Coffeewomple connected with a Dutch manufacturer called Giesen Roasting Solutions, which had just announced the largest commercially available electric coffee roaster.

Giesen planned to showcase its 2024
It wasn’t a financial decision. They estimated the electric roaster cost 2030“
Another challenge was finding physical space to rent in their price range with enough electric capacity to power the machine, which requires an alternating current of 400
The roasting process itself has been almost identical to gas, Whitney said, and despite the added costs and hurdles, the couple has no regrets about going electric for the environmental benefits.
A comprehensive number for coffee industry emissions is hard to come by, but studies have found most of its climate impact comes from planting, harvesting, and on-farm processing. The roasting step likely accounts for somewhere between 515
Coffeewomple was the first U.S. customer for Giesen’s large electric roaster — which can churn out about 33“
He attributed much of the demand to places where access to natural gas is limited, either by infrastructure or policy, as well as areas where government incentives exist to switch to electric equipment.
Giesen isn’t the only company betting on an electric coffee roasting future. Berkeley, California-based Bellwether Coffee has drawn attention from
Mill City Roasters in Minneapolis manufactures and sells small electric coffee roasters and also teaches classes on the roasting process. Owner Steve Green is skeptical about building a business around existing electric roasting technologies, but he’s seen enough interest from customers that he is working with an engineer to design a larger, higher-performing electric roaster.

Van Buitenen, of Giesen, compared the differences to those between electric and gasoline-fueled vehicles. They may handle differently, but that doesn’t mean one type is inferior to the other.
The move toward electric coffee roasting is part of a broader push to reduce emissions from food and beverage processing and manufacturing, the fourth largest source of U.S. industrial heat emissions following refineries, chemicals, and iron and steel, according to
“
In a state like Minnesota, where natural gas remains relatively cheap, many of the conversions to electric process heat are driven by concerns about climate change, but state incentives are also helping to move the needle. Isakson pointed to a 60
At their roasting facility in Southeast Minneapolis, Whitney and Bolea continue to look for ways to reduce their environmental impact while expanding their reach. They pay a premium for compostable packaging and use reusable buckets for larger customers.

PJM grid is strained as it is with not enough new generation coming online anytime soon. Shutting down a 760MW plant outside of Philadelphia is ridiculous. Build new, clean burning gas plants with Carbon Capture technology is what is needed. Certainly sources like wind or solar will have little effect is used to replace gas burning technology.

Because their availability and efficiency are low and offshore wind is extremely expensive. The cost of that will be passed onto to the customers once the government stops giving tax credits.

What does ""staying open"" actually mean operationally? If it's just keeping staff and doing maintenance to ensure normal availability, that doesn't mean it'll be dispatched. If a delayed-retirement unit doesn't clear in the dispatch market, it'll burn no fuel--just waste O&M money. Please clarify. Thanks -- Amory Lovins

Don't forget the energy disaster with inhumane consequences in the dead of Texas' harsh winter a few years ago. The state's energy council had forced fossil fuels to reduce or eliminate their usage percentage, replaced by solar and wind...leaving the state's energy grid vulnerable during the coldest of months, when windmills froze and solar input was low. Citizens suffered and died.

Maine’s
The plan, set to go into effect in July, is heavily focused on getting electric heat pumps in as many homes as possible. It comes as other states debate rolling back efficiency programs funded by utility customers as a short-term fix to rising energy prices. Maine’s strategy takes the opposite approach: It leverages investments in efficiency and electrification to lower rates for everyone.
““
Maine has been an aggressive adopter of home heat pumps in recent years. In 201910000020251750002027
The state’s new energy-efficiency plan is geared toward continuing this progress. It is centered largely on the idea of “
Over the next three years, the incentives in the plan are forecast to support 380006500990090003000
This strategy should decrease annual heating costs by more than $1000490
How? Utilities have certain fixed costs, such as maintaining power lines. To pay for them — and this is a bit of a simplification — they essentially divide the expense by the amount of power they expect customers to use in a year, and add that number to the rate they charge per kilowatt-hour. When more heat pumps come online, power demand goes up, so the fixed costs are spread out over more kilowatt-hours, lowering bills for the average consumer.
Accomplishing that effect depends on finding ways to make sure much of the added demand occurs during off-peak hours, when there is plenty of room for more power to flow along the lines without building out more infrastructure and thus increasing the utilities’ fixed costs. To achieve this timing, Maine’s plan includes demand-response programs that pay consumers for using less energy at peak times, an incentive for low-income residents to buy electric vehicles with chargers that can be set to work at off-peak times, and other measures.
““
Maine’s plan also includes an innovative program that calls for Efficiency Maine Trust to negotiate with retailers and distributors for discounted prices on electric water heaters and for agreements to keep the equipment in stock. The strategy is particularly effective at getting people to switch from fossil-fuel water heaters in moments when their old equipment has failed and they are searching for an affordable, easily available replacement, said Erin Cosgrove, director of policy and programs for the nonprofit Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships.
“
More states have prioritized electrification in their efficiency programs in recent years, said Mark Kresowik, senior policy director for the research group American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. Massachusetts, for example, phased out its incentives for oil and gas equipment last year, and Washington, D.C., has also eliminated rebates for fossil-fuel-powered systems and appliances.
““
Energy-efficiency programs have traditionally centered the big-picture goal of helping consumers lower their energy use to save money and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, whether that energy comes from an oil-delivery truck, a natural gas pipe, or over power lines.
Amid rising concern about climate change, however, more states have looked for ways to amplify the emissions impact of their programs. The solution has been to limit or eliminate incentives for fossil-fuel equipment and lean into electrification, which can often save consumers money and almost always reduce the emissions associated with heating and cooling their homes.

Community solar does a great deal to lower electricity costs. Community solar has taken off as a result of this, coupled with state legal and regulatory incentives for their development. To lower electricity costs during the heating season for heat pump use, community storage installations must get similar treatment. Of course, the larger grid operators and utilities fight this sort thing, and often successfully. Even is California, lies and delusions have been successfully employed to dupe regulators into destructive actions that damage the slim chances of the survival of the current biosphere, which of course is entirely essential to our survival. Apparently humans are, at least in the aggregate, proving to be too stupid to crawl out of our own excrement.

Clean energy advocates in North Carolina remain bullish about a Duke Energy initiative to help its poorest customers pay their bills and access weatherization programs, even though participation in its first year fell short of predictions.
A side deal Duke struck in 2023 to lessen the blow of its rate hikes, the Customer Assistance Program offers a monthly bill credit of up to $4250000

Beginning early 2024
North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services administers the two funds and has a data-sharing agreement with Duke, which then automatically enrolls customers in its assistance program — a process designed to minimize overhead expenses such as vetting ratepayers for eligibility.
The data-sharing agreement has impressed advocates in other states, said Claire Williamson, energy policy advocate with the North Carolina Justice Center.

That’s why the Customer Assistance Program was also designed to automatically refer eligible customers to weatherization programs. A Duke spokesperson said the utility did do that, but she declined to provide numbers.
Over the next two years of the three-year pilot program, the challenge for advocates and Duke is multifold. One item on the list: expanding help beyond those who are receiving federal crisis assistance.

For instance, Hardison noted that the Crisis Assistance Ministry administers a separate Duke assistance program, the Share the Light Fund, which is fueled by ratepayer and shareholder donations. She suggested her group and other administrators of that fund could also screen participants for the $42

The new Rhodium findings illustrate how swiftly Trump and the GOP
Three years ago, then-president Joe Biden signed the landmark Inflation Reduction Act into effect, creating generous tax incentives for renewables, home-energy upgrades, and electric vehicles, as well as a host of grant and loan programs aimed at accelerating industries away from fossil fuel use.
But the Trump administration and the GOP-controlled Congress have essentially repealed the law, as well as a host of other environmental protections, like limits on vehicle emissions, that would have helped not only rein in greenhouse gases but also reduce harmful air pollution.
It’s grim news. But inherent in this rapid reversal of progress is, if you squint, a kernel of hope: Trump has proven that things can change very fast. Under a new administration, a rapid change of trajectory could happen again.

I don't deny Trump has had a negative impact and moved the scale upward, but these Rhodium-style analyses are highly assumption driven, and without those close at hand it's hard to say whether it's reasonable or not. If they're assuming costs don't change at all, or interest rates stay high, or many many other things, that could produce this result or a different result.
Just a word of caution there.

A kernel of hope is how much other countries are stepping up to reduce GHG emissions. This is spurred on by the low cost of solar and declining costs of batteries. China is financing and building renewable energy projects in the Middle East and Africa. South Korea is stepping up its renewable energy investments. Where Brazil and India go is still uncertain.

California has labored for years to build enough clean energy to wean itself off fossil fuels. Now the effort is paying off in an undeniable way.
President Donald Trump’s Department of Energy might “

These trends have resulted in numerous clean energy records this summer. In the California Independent System Operator’s grid, which serves most of the state, solar delivered a record 30730
California’s electricity supply increasingly diverges from the nation’s. Gas has predominated since 20164016207
Initially, California’s billions of dollars in solar subsidies and suite of supporting policies couldn’t overcome the state’s gas dependency. The solar systems cranked out excess power through the sunny hours, much of which got curtailed for lack of simultaneous demand, then California turned to fossil fuels to keep the lights on at night. That addiction at times overpowered the state’s environmental ethos: California even opted in 2020
Such desperation gave temporary succor to solar skeptics and gas boosters. But when an energy system starts to change, snapshots in time are less instructive than the trend lines. And California’s trend lines have been pointing in one direction.
While the state hasn’t been building new gas generation, it has connected gigawatts of new solar and batteries each year. These resources are nearly free to operate once built, while gas plant owners have to buy fuel to combust and keep complex machinery in fine working order.

Now California’s gas plants have more competition in the peak hours from cheaper, cleaner resources; they’re getting squeezed toward fewer hours of intense demand.
But it would be a mistake to think that these trends stop at the Sierra Nevada. Indeed, these patterns are playing out nationally: Very little new gas capacity is getting built, quite a lot of solar and batteries are, and gas prices are going up.
Some regions allow developers to respond nimbly to these trends, namely Texas, which indeed has leapt ahead of California in its pace of solar and storage installations. Other regions obstruct such dynamism and face the consequences, like the mid-Atlantic wholesale markets run by PJMskyrocketing capacity auctions are pushing costs to crisis levels.
California’s grid overhaul has been a long time coming, and one lesson here is that big changes — like redesigning the energy system for the world’s fourth largest economy — take time. But other states won’t have to wait as long: They can tap into a mature supply chain that scaled up thanks to California and other early adopters, plus the industrial expertise to design and manage large solar construction efforts and the financing options de-risked by years of data from earlier projects.
The federal government is trying to stymie renewables however it can. But California is demonstrating the rewards for getting solar to escape velocity, and that momentum is set to carry forward in the coming years.

The California Public Utilities Commission is considering issuing a procurement order for an additional 6,000 megawatts of battery capacity to come on line from 2028 to 2032. In order to charge those batterie a lot more solar at every scale will need to be built. If developers can meet the Department of Treasury's ""commence construction"" rules most of the solar built through 2030 can still capture federal tax credits.

As an energy developer I can assure you solar and batteries only compete with 30 to 50% subsidies, RECs, and state policies mandating purchase of said green power.
Frankly, we have more solar than we can consume and not enough batteries. Real time prices are often negative during the day, pg&e has to pay other states and utilities to take the power that pg&e is forced to buy, and peak Grid demand is after the sun sets.

Seamus Fitzgerald hears a lot of opinions about solar power. As the associate director of real estate at OneEnergy Renewables, a solar energy developer, he approaches farmers and other landowners across the Midwest with proposals to lease their properties for solar projects. Some landowners are excited about being part of the shift to clean energy. Others are hostile to the idea of putting rows of gleaming panels on their land.

Illinois’s ambitious clean energy transition, which mandates a 2045the proliferation of data centers. Utility-scale battery installations will be key to ensuring that renewables — along with the state’s existing nuclear fleet — can meet electricity demand.
That’s why energy companies and advocates are racing to get legislation passed that incentivizes the addition of battery storage on the grid, before the state legislative session ends May 31
On May 1
Clean energy industry leaders and advocates have been pushing for storage incentives for years and were disappointed that such provisions were not included in the 2021
In a January lame-duck session, the legislature passed a narrow bill that ordered the Illinois Commerce Commission — which regulates utilities — to hold
In the report, the commission noted that energy storage would reduce prices, increase grid reliability and resilience, avoid costly grid upgrades and power plant construction, facilitate renewable energy deployment, and create “
Jeff Danielson, vice president of advocacy for the Clean Grid Alliance, whose members include renewable power and battery storage developers, said the plans are long overdue.
““
The report recommends that the Illinois Power Agency do an initial procurement for 1038588MWPJM450MW2026320302030
Advocates and industry groups said they are generally happy with the proposals, though energy storage and renewable industry leaders were asking for a 1500 initial procurement and up to 15GW2035840MW
““
## The case for boosting Illinois’ energy storage market now
It’s crucial that legislation pass this year since storage developers are seeing increasing demand nationwide and deciding where to invest, said Samarth Medakkar, Illinois lead for Advanced Energy United, an industry group whose members include renewable and storage companies.
There are already gigawatts of proposed battery storage projects in Illinois that are waiting for approval from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator to interconnect to the grid. Those projects need funding to progress and meet deadlines set by the grid operator to stay in the queue, Medakkar explained.
““
A letter from storage and renewable developers to the chief of the Commerce Commission’s Public Utilities Bureau, offering comments on the draft report, noted that storage projects take seven to 102030
““
## What’s the best way to incentivize grid batteries?
The commission’s report proposes incentivizing storage through a market for indexed storage credits, structured similarly to the state’s renewable energy credit program that has fueled a boom in solar power and, to a lesser degree, wind power. Under this design, the developer or owner of the storage is essentially allowed to sell credits for funds awarded by the state and collected from utility customers.
New York is the only other state with a storage credit market, according to experts. If Illinois passes legislation and launches the program this summer, it will be rolling out around the same time as the nascent program in New York, scheduled to hold its first procurement by the end of June. In other states, grid storage is supported through a structure known as tolling agreements, wherein utilities or other companies build and operate battery installations on the grid, and utility customers are essentially charged for their use.
In both models, residents pay for the new storage through their electric bills — just as they pay for renewables under Illinois’ existing renewable energy credit program. The Commerce Commission found that 3GW39169
Danielson said battery storage developers prefer a tolling structure since it is a much more common and potentially more effective practice. It would be “
“
James Gignac, Midwest policy director of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said clean energy advocates are on the same page.
““
Danielson noted that California, New York, and Texas have the largest amounts of on-grid storage in the country, and Illinois could be poised to join them.
““
The battery storage workshops this spring were “CEJA2021“
## Illinois mulls workforce equity requirements
One subject of debate is whether the storage incentives should include the same focus on equity that has characterized Illinois’s existing clean energy laws – CEJA
Members of the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition objected, noting that solar and wind jobs also involve high voltage. In comments to the commission on behalf of clean energy groups, Gignac stated that solar and wind developers can request waivers under the state law if they can’t find equity-qualifying candidates for certain jobs; meanwhile, there is “
The final recommendations encourage the same equity standards for storage development as for renewables, a change lauded by advocates.
“
Clean energy advocates and industry representatives plan to encourage lawmakers to amend or introduce legislation based on the findings in the Commerce Commission’s report, they said
The Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition, which helped pass CEJApushing for a new energy omnibus bill this legislative session. Members said they are hoping to work with industry to add storage-related language. Meanwhile, renewable and storage industry stakeholders are 15GW2035

Interesting article and there is a lot here. But a few questions - living in Chicago, I hear ""incentives"" and I think shovel fulls of money for the politically connected. If there are already GW projects in the queue for MISO, why not try and speed that process rather than shovel money? Second, are there studies delineating what changes in purchase prices might do (not net metering, but prices related to the timing of the purchase and sale) to encourage people to purchase and hook up batteries?

I guess Newsom has calculated that IOUs can have a more impactful contribution to his presidential campaign than California rate payers and clean grid advocates.

There is so much I don't understand about California and, separately, about VPPs. We've been talking about VPPs for years and yet we honestly don't seem any closer to it. It seems like a great idea, but the details seems so complicated as to be impossible. And then there is California - mandate rooftop solar, mandate load shifting, but the only path to fulfilling these mandates are more and more subsidies. VPPs seem great in theory, but can't seem to make any real progress in reality. Is this true? What (honestly, I actually care) are the pressure points?

Your statement that Californians ""pay roughly twice the U.S. average"" is a common mistake - the bills Californians pay are not twice, thanks to energy efficiency. The rates may be twice as high, but bills are not. Therefore, we don't pay twice as much. I point this out because most people focus on what they pay, not the rates.

The last paragraph is the most telling. If the legislation is only implemented if the state ""proactively"" funds it and the State of California is running a $20 billion deficit (not counting reserve accounts as ""revenue"") then none of the actions in these bills were going to happen. It sounds like most legislators are upset the vetoes prevent them from claiming their free, but irrelevant, virtual signaling.

Even if project developers felt they could figure out compliance, they’d have a difficult time convincing a bank to finance a project that lacks certainty about crucial financial incentives.
Ted Lee, a former Biden administration Treasury official who was also deeply involved in implementation of tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, agreed with Costa’s assessment.

For the “45 and 48 tax credits, which are available to all forms of carbon-free energy, the bill’s strict FEOC
That risk would be heightened by a proposal in the House Ways and Means bill that would shift the milestones for these projects to be eligible to claim investment and energy production tax credits, Lee noted. Today, projects can claim the credit and secure financing based on when they begin construction. But under the proposed change, they would have to secure investors based on when they can achieve “
The time lag between starting construction and being placed in service can stretch into years, putting more projects at risk of missing the deadline to avoid the FEOC

A different set of risks faces the 45 tax credit, the cornerstone of the huge surge in domestic factories for solar panels, batteries, critical minerals, and other clean energy materials. The manufacturers receiving this incentive have locked down financing for their facilities under the assumption that they’ll be able to earn the per-unit tax credits provided by 45 for their products for years to come.

When Russia invaded Ukraine three years ago, it ignited an energy crisis that threatened to upend Europe.
The continent relied on Russia for much of its gas supply for electricity and heating. Suddenly, European consumers faced soaring fuel prices, which rewarded Russia for the very chaos it had caused. European leaders became determined to find replacements for Russian fossil fuels, so they could stop paying the aggressor to fund its own war effort.
Climate activists argued for seizing the opportunity to hasten Europe’s clean energy transition by building more renewables and electrifying gas heating, and the European Commission linked the “2022EU40452030
Now that three years have passed, it’s worth taking stock of just how Europe has fared with these ambitious goals.
The continent has indeed radically reduced dependence on an aggressive Russia to keep its lights on and its homes heated, and it has cut overall usage of fossil fuels since the war began, especially in the power sector.
“
That decimation of energy flows from Russia represents a huge geopolitical success for Europe, one that would have been hard to envision prior to the war. Meanwhile, the EU
Of course, many factors outside of climate policy enabled this outcome.
American shipments of liquefied natural gas took the place of much of that Russian fuel, swapping one country’s planet-warming fossil fuels for another’s. Some factories shut down or moved overseas rather than operate with such high energy costs. The energy price spike acted as an unintended carbon price, pushing consumers to limit gas combustion out of financial necessity. Relatively mild winters also offered reprieve from ruinous heating bills.
In short, many of the factors driving down gas demand were entirely separate from muscular climate policies, and not necessarily permanent. As a result, the aggressive decarbonization that many had envisioned has not been fully realized.
“‘“
## Europe cut total gas demand and replaced most Russian imports
Europe uses gas for many things: generating electricity, heating buildings, supplying heavy industry. Over the last three years, Europe has managed to lower its total gas demand while almost zeroing out the gas it gets from Russia.
Europe consumed about 4002021802020232024

““2025
Lowering gas consumption at the expense of a thriving industrial sector is not the kind of trade-off European leaders want to make. Indeed, they finalized a Clean Industrial Deal last month to show that decarbonization can proceed without snuffing out factories entirely, but that policy has not had time to make an impact yet.
The question lingering over the top-line gas decrease is whether it will persist.
Gas consumption plummeted amid the 2022BNEF““
## Clean energy surges across European power sector
European nations have succeeded best at driving gas out of their electricity supply.
Steady advances in solar and wind installations helped renewables generate 7129

In long-term metrics, Europe’s power system now emits less than half the carbon emissions it gushed at its peak in 2007213CO2361CO2
The initial urgency around reducing gas demand may have subsided, but renewables developers will continue to benefit from structural reforms to streamline permitting.
The REPowerEU plan stressed speeding up permits for clean energy construction, but it fell to each member state to implement that principle in its national law, Perelli-Rocco explained. This created some success stories: Germany prioritized renewables construction over other interests in permitting discussions. Italy, by contrast, gave siting power to regional governments, which let some regions slow or ban renewables entirely, Perelli-Rocco added.

A number of Connecticut cities and towns want to secure more clean electricity for residents using a program that has already saved millions of dollars for consumers in other states.
Community choice aggregation allows cities and towns — or, in some cases, multiple municipalities working together — to negotiate with electricity suppliers on behalf of their residents. The goal is to achieve lower rates than those offered by utilities, often with a higher percentage of renewable energy in the mix.
““
Nationally, community choice aggregation, also known as municipal aggregation, is authorized by 1011th
Data suggest there are opportunities for meaningful savings. In Massachusetts, 2253512024200237511
““
Connecticut’s version of aggregation could be particularly ambitious, following a model used in California and New Hampshire. This approach allows cities and towns to choose between a basic aggregation program, in which a hired energy broker negotiates for electricity on behalf of residents, and a system in which multiple municipalities band together to form a larger aggregator that could handle the process of procuring power itself.
The multi-community approach allows these aggregation groups to retain the revenues that would have gone to an outside broker and use these reserve funds to develop and manage their own programs aimed at producing renewable energy, supporting energy efficiency, or reducing demand. In its first year, New Hampshire’s aggregation program saved ratepayers in participating communities about $1410
In California, this strategy has helped fund dozens of programs including battery rebates, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and discounts on solar power for low-income households.
Some skeptics of community choice aggregation have raised concerns about Connecticut’s proposed model, which would make a city or town’s negotiated rate the default for residents but allow them to opt out if they’d rather stick with utility service or an alternate supplier. Consumers, they say, should not be placed in a new program without choosing to make the move.
Supporters, however, argue that the successes in states where municipal aggregation has already been deployed demonstrate the model works with little risk to consumers.

If you’re new to the subject, here is an _overview_. In brief: Utility companies used dark money groups to route roughly $6015
_Sign up for the newsletter._
The Ohio Manufacturers’ Association Energy Group and the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel filed briefs last week that call for FirstEnergy’s Ohio utilities to pay more than half a billion dollars for regulatory violations in three of the agency’s House Bill 6
It’s the latest development in the saga of HB62019ongoing corruption scandal involving FirstEnergy, which owns three regulated utilities in Ohio. In the alleged multimillion-dollar conspiracy, the sprawling corporation used dark money — political spending whose ultimate source is concealed — to bribe former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder (R) and pay others for their help in passing and protecting the law for the benefit of FirstEnergy and its unregulated subsidiaries, including FirstEnergy Solutions, which ran two Ohio nuclear plants and was in bankruptcy at the time.
The legislation would have charged customers of utilities across the state — including FirstEnergy’s utilities, AEPAES1nuclear plants. Lawmakers repealed that charge in 2021guaranteeing revenue for utilities. HB61950through mid-August. Terms gutting Ohio’s renewable energy and energy-efficiency standards also remain in place.

## What does evidence show?
FirstEnergy spokesperson Jennifer Young said the company is unable to comment on ongoing litigation. Yet the utilities’ brief raises unusual arguments about the state’s corporate separation law and their failure to track specifically how customer money was spent.
FirstEnergy’s utilities concede that state law prohibits them from favoring their unregulated affiliate, FirstEnergy Solutions. But they argue that this rule was not broken, claiming that the company’s bribes to public officials were meant to boost the financial standing of its regulated utilities. HB6

Massachusetts last week enacted a revamped version of its solar incentive program that developers and advocates say should keep the state’s solar industry moving forward even as the Trump administration pushes to undermine federal support for clean energy.
““
The newest iteration of the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target program — generally called SMART
The state filed the new rules as emergency regulations, allowing them to go into effect immediately.
The move comes just in time, according to solar developers. The previous version of SMARTSMARTnearly a year ago, and a final revision was expected in fall 2024
“
In the meantime, President Donald Trump took office and Republican legislators have been working on a budget bill that seems likely to accelerate the elimination of federal renewable energy tax credits. Massachusetts solar developers became increasingly worried they would find themselves in a “
Developers, therefore, heaved a sigh of relief when the new state regulations were filed. The reimagined program will start accepting applications on October 15
““
## What’s new in the new Massachusetts SMART
Launched in 2018SMART“
The program was initially designed to lower its rates as more solar installations were built. The thinking was that, as the solar industry became more established, the cost of developing projects would go down and developers would need less financial support to be viable.
For years, SMART2019202119SMART20242021
“
The new rules jettison the old system of declining rates, replacing it with one that resets the compensation and program size each year, allowing the program to adjust to future unexpected market changes. Annually, the state will conduct an economic analysis that considers progress toward emissions reduction goals, regional and national solar costs, current and historic program participation rates, and land-use and protection goals, and will use the results to set compensation for the coming year. Adders will still be part of the system, and will also be adjusted annually, as needed.
““
For 2025450
The revised regulations also aim to increase the amount of money flowing to solar projects serving low-income residents. For a development to receive an adder as a community shared solar project, it must allocate at least 4020
““
## Solving siting challenges
The new regulations also target ongoing tensions about how best to site solar projects while still protecting wildlife habitats and agricultural land.
““
Certain categories of land with particular environmental value have been declared ineligible for solar development going forward. Projects built on other open spaces will have to pay a mitigation fee that will be determined by a list of factors, including the land’s carbon storage and agricultural potential, the parcel’s ecological integrity, the cumulative impact of the proposed development and others in the area, and location of the planned project relative to grid infrastructure.
“
These measures are combined with provisions that encourage more development on the built environment. The regulations expand the definition of a solar canopy that qualifies for an adder — which was limited to projects over parking lots, canals, and pedestrian walkways — to include any array raised high enough off the ground to allow the use of the area beneath for another function. The rules also create a new category of adder for panels mounted above other equipment atop buildings, allowing more efficient use of rooftop space.
Though the emergency regulations process put the new rules into effect immediately, the state must still hold three hearings within 90

California’s expansive cap-and-trade program was also called out in Trump’s order.

On Wednesday, three state legislators representing the coastal area affected by the fire “BESS
In the meantime, concerned residents staring down battery plants in other parts of the country can take some solace in the fact that Vistra’s Moss Landing facility was one of a kind, conceived and designed before modern safety standards were adopted for large grid batteries. Battery safety standards have been updated multiple times since it was built.
It may sound counterintuitive to think of a storage plant completed in 2020second-biggest source of new U.S. grid capacity, behind solar power.
In that short time, the storage industry has matured through a process of trial and error that has included several high-profile fires. None of these have killed anyone, but a pivotal 2019
Moss Landing’s design was “1950
In this case, the lack of exact copycats is very good news: It means that the design elements that allowed Moss Landing to burn so apocalyptically are not present in newer or forthcoming battery plants. The bad news is that a handful of other battery projects built around the same time as Moss Landing are slated to operate for years to come.
## Key factors in the Moss Landing battery fire
We don’t know what caused the Moss Landing fire, but we do know two big factors that help explain why the facility burned so spectacularly.
First off, Vistra used batteries manufactured by Korea’s LGLGNMC
Indeed, many of the most prominent battery fires in the U.S. sprang from LG2024LGLG2020
NMCEV
The grid storage market has also LFPLFP2021
The other defining factor specific to Moss Landing was the choice to use a large, legacy building to house rows and rows of battery racks.
That decision made sense at the time. California was looking for big batteries to help its shift to clean energy, and Vistra had taken over the old Moss Landing power plant in its acquisition of power producer Dynegy. In hindsight, it seems that the design choice packed too much battery fuel into one enclosed space, creating the conditions for an unstoppable, 100
Nearly all grid batteries installed in the past several years have opted not for one overarching building but for row upon row of modular battery containers. Each box contains batteries, controls, and safety equipment. Projects are designed so that if a fire breaks out at one individual container, it won’t propagate to neighboring units. This limits the amount of fuel a fire could engulf and makes it easier for emergency responders to suppress a fire with water.
Case in point: A fire broke out at the neighboring Tesla project in September 2022
## A brief history of battery safety regulations
While industry trends have moved toward safer batteries and containerized systems, fire safety codes have also evolved.
Two major fire safety codes govern grid battery installations today: Most states, including California, to International Fire Code (IFCNFPA855
IFC2018NFPA85520192020NFPA855
California regulators formally 20182020
The state began enforcing the 2018IFC
Moss Landing may have reflected the storage industry’s best insights into battery safety, but the industry was considerably younger then. The U.S. installed just 300MW
When Moss Landing was under development, the storage industry hadn’t had the opportunity to learn from mistakes. After the battery fire erupted near Phoenix in 20192020
The upshot here is that nobody building a battery project today would do it with the particular technological generation of batteries or the fire code specs that Vistra used at Moss Landing. Now the lessons learned from Moss Landing will shape the fire codes for projects that come after.
““
In another promising new trend for battery safety, leading manufacturers now perform more intensive fire testing of lithium-ion cabinets, not just individual cells or modules, said Warner, who co-founded the Energy Safety Response Group. This kind of large-scale testing with real fire is being incorporated into forthcoming safety code updates, Warner added, and provides much more realistic data for understanding how batteries behave in a fire compared with extrapolations from small-scale fire or stress tests.
The industry’s incremental progress on safety didn’t stop the residents of Moss Landing from having to flee their homes again, and that’s a major failure. But a justifiably wary public can rest assured that this particular facility has little in common with the rest of the United States’ rapidly growing grid battery fleet.

Julian, Thanks for bringing attention to the new codes that are helping improve ESS safety. It should be added that UL 9540 (the safety standard for ESS) which has been required by the last two code cycles of the IFC, IRC, and NFPA 855 has proven quite effective and there have been very few incidents with UL 9540 listed ESS.
Another item to mention that both LFP and NMC have safety considerations that are different, but important to understand. Neither is better or worse, just different safety profiles with NMC being more vulnerable to thermal runaway and LFP creating more potential off gassing in thermal runaway.

My Redwood tour guide assured me, however, that we were in the right place. Underneath those white shrouds were 792EV
Redwood hailed the installation as a breakthrough in the sleepy field of second-life batteries, which has been around for a while but failed to move beyond initial proofs of concept to repeated, large-scale deployments. The firm has indeed broken a record for that stunted sector, certainly in the U.S. and likely the world, delivering 631247
Given the initial success, Straubel sees the energy storage business as a key growth area for Redwood, which was founded in 2017
““
Assuming the concept scales up further, it could be a game changer for data centers that prize speedy new energy construction. But it could further reshape the clean energy transition. Dozens of startups have toiled for years to invent new batteries for long-duration storage. Redwood has already beaten them to a large-scale deployment, without inventing anything new and risky — all it took was some clever reimagining of what others viewed as waste.
## A radical new approach to second-life battery design
Using old EVEV80
Yet few second-life grid storage installations exist.
Most of the people who have actually installed second-life batteries have approached it as a small-scale research project, typically grant-funded. A scrappy company called B2U2020built an array of old packs to deliver solar power into California’s energy markets in the most lucrative evening hours. I verified that with my own eyes in 2021B2U2812
Another startup called Element Energy obtained a bounty of lightly used packs, quite possibly through their investor LG53. Next, it plans to build a factory to mass-produce enclosures for second-life installations.
Now, Redwood has entered the scene with its sprawling Nevada installation.
All of these developers have had to grapple with the same initial challenges. They need to get their hands on old EV
Redwood immediately stands out for its ability to handily source old packs. The company is, officially, a battery recycler, and it says it receives more old batteries than any of its U.S. competitors. All week long, trucks drop off pallets of everything from toothbrush batteries to electric-truck packs, which workers sort and stash in a 32
“EV120235
“
Another differentiator might as well be called moxie. Founder Straubel sets the tone as a clean-energy nerd who just likes to give things a shot. He tried second-life microgrids at home before making it a focus for the workplace. His engineers hacked together a universal controller box that connects to each type of EV
![]( The solar array that powers Crusoe’s data center, tucked in between Redwood’s recycling facilities. The open-air depot where Redwood receives and stores battery deliveries is visible in the back right. (Courtesy of Redwood Materials)
Lastly, the Redwood approach bucks conventional opinion in ways that save time and money.
The storage industry, as a rule, puts its batteries in big metal boxes. Redwood engineers saw that as unnecessary, given how painstakingly ruggedized the packs had to be for vehicular use. No big boxes means no pouring concrete pads. The approach saves on labor, time, and materials.
““
On the solar side, Redwood went with a company that shares the “Erthos, a scrappy new alternative to the highly engineered trackers that eke every last electron out of the day’s solar arc. This flat-on-the-ground installation also allows a handful of cleaning robots to circumnavigate the array daily and wipe the dust away; their little headlights peeked through the night as Redwood’s celebration cast laser lights across the battery field.
## **AI**
Redwood launched Redwood Energy, its business line for second-life storage, at a precarious time for the battery recycling industry, which has promised to recover nearly all the useful materials from old EV
Redwood succeeded in raising nearly $2 in equity investment since its founding in 2017declared bankruptcy this year after failing to raise the money to complete its recycling facility in upstate New York. Another top contender, Ascend Elements, has pushed back its timeline for a facility in Kentucky, citing delays from its anchor customer.
The actual task of economically recovering the most valuable battery materials appears to have proven harder in practice than it looked in the pitch decks. Setting aside the technical challenges, there are serious business obstacles. Many key battery commodities have fallen steeply from high prices a few years back, undercutting the value of the recycled products. And there isn’t yet a critical mass of cathode makers to sell to in the U.S., so any recovered materials are just going to generic metals markets for now.
“EV
While that market for recycled materials develops, Redwood can pull in “
““
That’s somewhat jarring to hear from the battery recycling startup with the most money behind it. The investors funded a battery materials business, not a second-hand battery purveyor. But Straubel stressed that he sees the energy business as additive, not competitive with the original business.

Redwood Energy is talking with AI

Peak Energy’s first grid-battery installation, assembled in California and shipped to Colorado, tests a new battery chemistry’s ability to operate safely with just passive cooling controls. (Peak Energy)
China’s dominance of the battery supply chain is uncontested. Many U.S. storage companies have tried to catch up by replicating the technologies already in mass production there. But a smaller cohort is taking a different tack: building factories for next-generation batteries that could give American manufacturers more of a competitive edge.
202387535
In fairness, the battery cells were imported from China, but Peak designed and built a new enclosure for them in Burlingame, California. Since the sodium batteries are especially rugged, Peak could forgo the temperature-control equipment needed for the current favorite chemistry for grid storage, lithium ferrous phosphate (LFP
The installation is a rare bright spot as the storage industry at large grapples with the impacts of Trump administration energy policy. President Donald Trump’s unpredictably shifting tariffs on China have raised the costs of imported batteries and made it hard to plan. The White House’s signature budget law ripped up some — but not all — tax credits meant to support domestic manufacturing of batteries, and added dense new bureaucratic requirements around components from China. New investment in domestic clean-energy manufacturing has plummeted since Trump took office.
But the power sector still wants to build grid batteries at record pace, especially as supersized data centers clamor for electricity supply as soon as possible.
## Safer batteries mean less energy spent on temperature control
Upstart battery-makers often jockey over how much energy density they can pack into their cells, or how they can reduce the fire risks that follow from squeezing so much energy into a tight footprint. Peak Energy brags more about what its technology doesn’t need: heavy-duty climate control.
“LFP202577dramatic battery fires has already inspired community pushback against storage plants, making safety a crucial part of the industry’s social license. Indeed, this week U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin

This saves money by reducing the cost of materials and cutting auxiliary power usage up to 90caused several of the recent high-profile grid-battery fires (by, for example, erroneously spraying water on live batteries, which can make a fire where there wasn’t one).
!A white box in a desert setting A rendering of Peak's battery system (Peak Energy)
Plenty of cleantech startups have pitched themselves as safer alternatives to dominant strains of lithium-ion batteries, only to be crushed mercilessly by the lithium-ion manufacturing juggernaut. Overwhelming scale and a wealth of industrial expertise keep pushing mainstream batteries to lower prices and superior performance. However, the up-front costs of the batteries themselves are now just a small piece of the overall bill.
“
According to Dales’ calculations, the energy savings from the passive cooling of Peak Energy’s battery enclosure over a period of 20

## Lining up customers now to avoid getting ​“
Flipping the switch on the Colorado project is just the start. Then Peak Energy needs to find paying customers interested in much bigger versions of the technology. But the startup has an innovative plan for that next step.
The founders of many battery startups focus on a technology that they find interesting (maybe they chose it for their doctoral research years ago), and then at some point have to convince customers to buy it. This typically leads to what Dales identified as “
Peak Energy’s founders decided on a different strategy: develop a product in conversation with prospective customers, so they actually want to buy it when it’s ready.
The Colorado project, paid for by Peak, will be scrutinized by a consortium of nine utilities and independent power producers, who have signed on to receive exclusive performance data. If the project meets agreed-upon metrics, these companies will buy Peak’s product for their own use.
““‘
Some of those consortium members have requested batteries for demonstration projects in 202610502027
The path from initial installation to giga-scale projects always takes longer than battery startups initially pledge. In fact, only lithium-ion batteries have crossed that threshold, while more unusual variants languish in the minor leagues.
But Peak doesn’t have to invent the core technology — it’s piggybacking off an emerging field of China’s battery industry — and it’s coming to market at a time of propulsive growth in grid storage demand. Its task might not be quite so daunting as it has been for other battery innovators.

This analysis and news roundup comes from the Canary Media Weekly newsletter. Sign up to get it every Friday.
Over the past few months, the Texas Senate passed three bills that could’ve devastated the state’s nation-leading renewable energy rollout — but clean energy has dodged the bullet.
The first of those bills would have established new fees, setback requirements, and other permitting regulations on utility-scale wind and solar development, even though fossil-fuel plants don’t face the same restrictions. The second would have required large renewables installations to buy gas generation as a backup.
And the third would’ve ensured all renewable power development came with a side of fossil fuels, as it directed that 5050
These bills would have seriously slowed Texas’ deployment of solar, batteries, and wind power, which are shattering power-generation records in the state and helping its grid withstand extreme weather and meet surging electricity demand. The legislation would have caused reliability to fall and utility bills to soar, according to
But the Texas House’s session is set to end on June 2
There are growing signs that these sorts of restrictions on renewables aren’t popular
Similar efforts in the state were defeated two years ago as well.

The deep-sea treasure that the administration seeks are lumpy, potato-sized rocks known as polymetallic nodules. They litter the mucky bottom of deep ocean areas across the planet. But in the 1970
Most of the world’s high-value nodules are found in international waters located between Hawaii and Mexico. Since 1994
Last month, delegates from France, Russia, China, and most of the world’s other major economies gathered to continue those negotiations in a conference center in Kingston, Jamaica, overlooking the city’s turquoise coastal waters. The U.S., which is the only major country that hasn’t ratified the 1994“
During the negotiations, run by the United Nations affiliate known as the International Seabed Authority, little progress was made on the specific task at hand: finalizing a code that would permit commercial mining on the high seas under the Law of the Sea.
Instead, during the two final days, the high-stakes deep-sea mining talks devolved into a public airing of grievances against the United States — including by several of the country’s allies, who, in an unusual move, have started to align more with China over the U.S. in the increasingly contentious fight.
That’s because President Donald Trump has been pushing the U.S. to barrel ahead on deep-sea mining. The country plans to permit mining in international waters under an obscure U.S. law from 1980“
Many legal experts worry that invoking the antiquated act now is a violation of international law.
For years, a handful of private firms have pushed the international community to green-light deep-sea mining, which they argue offers a less environmentally destructive path than land-based mining for acquiring the metals needed for the clean-energy transition. Scientists, environmental advocates, and others, meanwhile, have fiercely criticized the idea, calling into question the claim that deep-sea mining is the lesser of two evils — or even an economically feasible enterprise.
The Trump administration’s new push to unilaterally license mining was seen as a slap in the face to the dozens of countries meeting in Jamaica last month. Delegates emphasized that the International Seabed Authority is the only entity legally authorized to permit mining in ocean areas that lie beyond nations’ jurisdictions.
A main point of contention is that, according to the U.N. treaty, the international seabed is designated the “

The U.S. delegation declined to comment further when reached by Canary Media.
Duncan Currie, an international law expert based in New Zealand, told Canary Media during the negotiations that China is largely right when it comes to the U.S. being legally beholden to the treaty, even if the country never chose ratification. According to Currie, America’s active participation in annual meetings means that, under international law, the U.S. can’t claim to be a “
The Law of the Sea does more than regulate the seabed. It keeps peace for U.S. fisheries, naval operations, and cargo shipping, and enforces the country’s maritime boundaries. In this way, he explained, Trump’s executive order not only flouts international law, which currently prohibits unilateral mining activities in the high seas, but also threatens the bedrock law protecting American maritime industries like fishing and cargo shipping.
Trump’s push for deep-sea mining faces challenges beyond resistance from other countries.
The main commercial minerals that nodules contain are cobalt, manganese, copper, and nickel. These minerals are currently used in most of the lithium-ion batteries that go in EVs, but it’s unclear how much the auto industry will need in the coming decades. Notably, China has already moved away from using cobalt, manganese, and nickel in its EVlithium, iron, and phosphate — all of which are more abundant on land.
Even if they are needed, the market for deep-sea minerals may be lukewarm. Already, 64EVBMWGOP passed in July, which eliminates key EV
Recently, The Metals Co. has shifted its narrative from EVs to defense and U.S. mineral dominance, according to

Barbara Kelley remembers when her car and windows were routinely coated with a thin film of coal dust that had drifted over from the power plant on the edge of her neighborhood in Salem, Massachusetts. She remembers the noise as a conveyor belt lifted the coal into the building. She also remembers how pleased she was when the community started to discuss the possibility of building an offshore wind terminal on the site when the plant eventually closed.

Plug-in solar systems may provide a fraction of the energy generated by conventional rooftop arrays, but they also cost a lot less and are easier to install. (Bright Saver)
Small solar-panel kits that can be assembled as easily as an Ikea bookcase and plugged into a regular residential outlet could be coming soon to New Hampshire and Vermont. Lawmakers and advocates in both states are preparing legislation that would make these plug-in solar systems accessible to residents who don’t have the space, money, or inclination to install a larger, conventional rooftop array.

Unlike rooftop arrays, plug-in systems don’t generate enough power to meet all, or even most, of a household’s needs, but they offset enough consumption to pay for themselves within four or five years, even without incentives like tax credits or net metering, Chou said. Models now on the market start at about $2000

These systems have taken off in Germany, where
Recently, though, the idea has gained traction in the U.S. In March, Utah lawmakers, working with Bright Saver, unanimously
All of the legislative proposals follow the same principles as Utah’s law: They would define a new class of small, portable solar systems, and establish the right of households to use the systems without submitting applications or paying fees to the state or utilities. They also define safety standards for the systems, including that they be certified by Underwriters Laboratories, or UL
At the moment, two manufacturers make plug-in solar systems with inverters that have been certified as complying with safety requirements, Chou said. Because the market for portable solar is so new, however, UL
Other startups are waiting in the wings, hoping to launch their own products next year, once the questions about UL

Supporters hope the benefits of plug-in solar — lowered electricity costs, freedom to make personal energy choices — will help the idea gain support even in states not known for their embrace of renewable energy, and despite federal efforts to slow or stop renewable energy progress. The early and robust acceptance of the technology in deep-red Utah has bolstered this vision.

In New Hampshire, a swing state known for its “

Watters, a member of the state Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, worked with local advocacy group Clean Energy New Hampshire to author a rough draft of a plug-in solar bill based on Utah’s new law. It will be refined in the coming months and formally introduced in the legislature in January.
Notably, Watters said, his proposal would not stop homeowners associations or landlords from imposing their own rules on members and tenants.
““
In Vermont, two Democratic state legislators — Sen. Anne Watson, chair of the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy, and Rep. Kathleen James, chair of the counterpart committee in the House — are championing a plug-in solar bill based on model legislation drafted by Bright Saver. Watson is particularly excited for the potential of plug-in solar to reach low-income residents and renters.
“
Vermont, a decidedly left-leaning state, has long welcomed renewables. The state’s governor, Phil Scott, however, is a Republican who has shown reluctance to spend public money on clean energy. Further, the legislature lost its veto-proof Democratic majorities during the last election, so prospects for forward movement on energy and climate issues have been dimmed this year.
However, Watson has already heard a lot of positive feedback from her fellow lawmakers, even though the bill won’t be taken up until the legislature reconvenes in January. Indeed, several colleagues came to her with similar proposals before learning she was already working on it. She has also had initial conversations with the Scott administration and found it willing to consider the idea, she said.

If utilities, regulators, and policymakers move too rashly in response, they could unleash a surge in fossil-gas power-plant construction that will drive up consumer energy costs — and set back progress on shifting to carbon-free energy.
But this outcome is not inevitable. With some foresight, the data center boom can actually help — rather than hurt — the nation’s already stressed-out grid. Data center developers can make choices right now that will lower grid costs and power-system emissions.
And it just so happens that these solutions could also afford developers an advantage, allowing them to pay less for interconnection and power, win social license for their AI
When it comes to the grid, the nation faces a computational crossroads: Down one road lie greater costs, slower interconnection, and higher emissions. Down the other lies cheaper, cleaner, faster power that could benefit everyone.
## The big picture: A data center demand bubble
After decades with virtually no increase in U.S. electricity demand, data centers are driving tens of gigawatts of power demand growth in some parts of the country, according to a
Providing that much power would require “NRG
Utilities, regulators, and everyday customers have good reason to ask if the costs are worth it — because that’s far from clear right now, he said.
A fair amount of this growth is coming from data centers meant to serve well-established and solidly growing commercial demands, such as data storage, cloud computing, e-commerce, streaming video, and other internet services.
But the past two years have seen an explosion of power demand from sectors with far less certain futures.
A significant, if opaque, portion is coming from cryptocurrency mining operations, notoriously unstable and fickle businesses that can quickly pick up and move to new locations in search of cheaper power. The most startling increases, however, are for AI
Hundreds of billions of dollars in near-term AIAI2030
Beyond financial viability, these plans face physical limits. At least under current rules, power plants and grid infrastructure simply can’t be built fast enough to provide what data center developers say they need.
## Too big for the grid to handle

These saturated conditions are pushing developers into new markets, as the below chart from the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie shows.
!Wood Mackenzie chart of nearly 100 gigawatts of data center projects proposed in 18 U.S. states (Wood Mackenzie)
“
Of that demand growth, only a fraction can be met by building new solar and wind farms, Seiple added. And “
Seiple is referring to data centers’ need for reliable round-the-clock power, and utilities’ responsibility to provide it, including at moments of peak demand, usually during hot summers and cold winters. A lot of the money utilities spend goes toward building the power plants and grid infrastructure needed to meet those demand peaks.
Where renewables fall short, other resources like carbon-free hydropower, nuclear, geothermal, or clean-powered batteries could technically be built to serve at least a large portion of data center demand. But that’s generally not what’s playing out on the ground.
Instead, the data center boom is shaping up to be a huge boon for fossil-gas power plants. Investment bank Goldman Sachs AI5020304060
## How data centers could make the grid dirtier
Even tech firms with clean energy goals, like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, are having trouble squaring their soaring power needs with their professed climate commitments.
Over the past decade, those four companies have secured roughly 40GW
The inability to match growing demand with more clean power isn’t entirely these hyperscalers’ fault. Yearslong wait times have prevented hundreds of gigawatts of solar and wind farms and batteries from connecting to congested U.S. power grids.
Tech firms are also pursuing “develop (or restart) nuclear power plants, and Google has worked with advanced-geothermal-power startup Fervo Energy. But these options can’t be brought online or scaled up quickly enough to meet short-term power needs.
“AIISI“
And many data center customers and developers are indifferent to clean energy; they simply seek whatever resource can get their facility online first, whether to churn out cryptocurrency or win an advantage in the AI
Utilities that have sought for years to win regulatory approval for new gas plants have seized on data center load forecasts as a new rationale.

## How data centers could help, not hurt, energy costs and climate goals
If gas plants are built as planned to power data centers, dreams of decarbonizing the grid in the near future are essentially out the window.
But data centers don’t need to be powered by fossil fuels; it’s not a foregone conclusion.
As Frontier Group’s Good noted during last month’s Public Interest Network webinar, “
It’s up to regulators to sort this out, said Silverman of Johns Hopkins University. “
That’s what the Virginia lawmakers proposing new data center bills said they were trying to do. Two of the bills would order state regulators to study whether 252040
Other bills would give local governments power to review noise, water, and land-use impacts of data centers seeking to be sited in the state, require that data centers improve energy efficiency, and mandate quarterly reports of water and energy consumption.
Another sought to require that proposed new data centers undergo review by state utility regulators to ensure they won’t pose grid reliability problems. Democratic Delegate Josh Thomas, the bill’s sponsor, said that’s needed to manage the risks of unexamined load growth. Without that kind of check, “18
But that bill was
Data center developers have the ability to minimize or even help drive down power system costs and carbon emissions. They can work with utilities and regulators to bring more clean energy and batteries onto the grid or at data centers themselves. They can manage their demand to reduce grid strains and lower the costs of the infrastructure needed to serve them. And in so doing, they could secure scarce grid capacity in places where utilities are otherwise struggling to serve them.
The question is, will they? Silverman emphasized that utilities and regulators must treat grid reliability as their No. 1“
Given the pressure to support an industry that’s seen as essential to U.S. economic growth and international competitiveness, Silverman worries that “

Ohio consumer and environmental advocates are calling on state regulators to address disparities within FirstEnergy’s grid after a recent report found
Areas defined as disadvantaged under the Biden administration’s Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool were twice as likely to have low-voltage circuits compared to other parts of FirstEnergy’s Ohio territory, according to the study by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. Equipment was also generally older and had less capacity for normal and overload situations.
The results reflect historical patterns of underinvestment in disadvantaged communities, the report says, but the full scope of the problem — including across Ohio’s other utilities — is unclear due to the lack of information from utilities and regulators.
“
The Ohio Environmental Council submitted the report as part of 5
The state of the local grid matters when it comes to the reliability of customers’ electric service, their ability to add distributed renewable energy resources like rooftop solar, and a community’s potential to attract business investments that could improve its economic conditions.
Regulated electric utilities file reliability reports each spring that focus on two commonly used metrics. The system average interruption frequency index, or SAIFICAIDI
The annual reports also list factors involved in outages, with breakouts for transmission-related service problems and major events. Major events such as severe weather are considered statistical outliers that don’t count for calculating whether utilities meet their company-specific standards for CAIDISAIFI
While weather accounted for the majority of time Ohioans went without power last year, equipment failures also triggered thousands of outages. For the ninth year in a row, at least one Ohio utility company failed to meet reliability standards, reports filed this month show. Both
The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio also collects data on the worst-performing circuits. Individual circuits serve anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand customers. However, the state doesn’t post these reports online or disclose the circuit’s exact locations, which could be used to show whether they are concentrated in disadvantaged communities.
The SAIFICAIDI
Utilities in Ohio tend to be reactive in dealing with circuit problems, Banton said. Communities can face longer outages if utilities wait for equipment to fail before replacing it. Instead, Banton wants utilities’ capital investments to address current disparities and then prevent them from recurring in the future.
“
“
FirstEnergy has challenged the Ohio Environmental Council’s objections about grid disparities in its rate case. Meanwhile, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio is due to consider revisions to the annual reliability reporting requirements by Sept. 302026
## How the local grid impacts clean energy and economic development
The quality of a neighborhood’s grid influences more than whether residents’ lights stay on.
“
Rooftop solar or other distributed clean energy can add to traffic on local grid circuits, posing a challenge for equipment that’s older or has lower voltages or capacity. Those circuits generally can handle less grid traffic, Banton said. In contrast, newer, high-voltage circuits tend to have “
The grid’s quality and capacity also impact an area’s economic development. Historically, utilities have focused capital investment on places where people are moving or where they expect new industrial demand. That approach exacerbates inequity, Banton said. Even if businesses otherwise wanted to move to disadvantaged areas, poor electrical infrastructure may lead them to go elsewhere to avoid huge costs for upgrading the local grid, they said.
“
Because utilities have failed to invest in and maintain the grid evenly throughout their service territories, an equity-based approach to infrastructure modernization should make sure resources now go to areas that were left behind, Reames said.
He supports the report’s call for more granular data, including details on customers with repeated or prolonged outages. The report also calls on utilities to publish maps showing grid capacity, and information about which census tracts are served by each circuit and substation transformers.

Massachusetts’ attorney general says plans by the state’s major utilities to lower the cost of charging electric vehicles would offer little actual savings for customers.
In response to a 20222029
In a “
With this filing, the attorney general’s office joins climate advocates who support the idea of offering EVcharging during off-peak hours but take issue with the way utilities propose to implement the strategy.
“
Regulators have asked the utilities for feedback on the attorney general’s concerns and recommendations by February 20
## State law calls for EV
More than a third of cars sold in the United States are likely to be EVs by 2030
Massachusetts has set the ambitious target of putting 9000002030EV
“
In the 2023
Eversource’s plan calls for a $15EV191014
Regulators must rule on these proposals by the end of October.
## **‘**
The numbers laid out by the utilities don’t add up to savings for consumers, the attorney general’s testimony argues. Thus, the proposals are unlikely to motivate more people to buy EVs or to shift their charging times.
The utilities did not estimate the cost of installing a separate meter, but 14004000EV14621
“
The attorney general’s office recommends that public utilities regulators reject National Grid and Eversource’s proposals and offers several alternative approaches. The simplest, the testimony says, would be to offer whole-home time-of-use rates, rather than separating out the vehicle charging load. Evidence from other states suggests such a rate could be implemented during the roll-out of advanced metering infrastructure, rather than waiting the minimum of four years the utilities say would be necessary for an EV-specific rate. The filing points to Colorado, where time-of-use rates are rolling out in concert with advanced metering infrastructure.
Another option would be to use data collected by vehicle computer systems or chargers themselves to issue rebates or apply lower rates for charging done at off-peak times. Utilities in California and Minnesota have already deployed this approach.
The same data could be used to offer other financial incentives. National Grid, in fact, already 5EV3
Any of these approaches could be used not just to improve financial incentives for customers but also to speed up their implementation, to the benefit of both consumers and the environment, Vanderspek said.

But the Moss Landing conflagration jolted the state as it burned for several days, provoked evacuations of surrounding communities, and destroyed an old power-plant hall that electricity company Vistra had packed full of lithium-ion batteries in 2020
In the years since Moss Landing came online, though, the grid battery industry has moved on from that type of design. These days, most every project places batteries in individual containers spaced out across an open field, which minimizes the chances of a fire spreading between them.
Even with those advances in grid battery designs, state Sen. John Laird saw an opportunity to tighten state requirements in light of what happened in January, and he authored SB283
““
Instead of leaving everything up to local jurisdictions — which may be reviewing a large battery project for the first time — the law requires developers to collaborate with first responders on emergency-response plans. Battery developers must now meet with fire authorities during the design phase, and then bring them in to inspect fire-suppression systems prior to launching commercial operations.
That requirement “
An earlier draft of the law would have required California to adopt the National Fire Protection Association’s SB283
The final text does call for the fire marshal, in the next building code update, to “
This law isn’t the only state action afoot on this topic. The California Public Utilities Commission PUC
California leaders see a safe, sustainable grid storage industry as crucial to reaching the state’s long-term climate goals, because the battery plants facilitate the ongoing buildout of clean energy generation.
In 2020mere hundreds of megawatts of batteries hooked up to help the grid. This year, the state surpassed 15000cutting into fossil-gas consumption during evening hours, pushing down the cost of energy at those times.
Energy storage trade groups, eager to maintain the pace of the battery buildout, welcomed the new guidance from SB283
The national group American Clean Power, which advocates for the battery industry among others, spoke favorably of the bill’s potential impact. “SB283
““
The California Energy Storage Alliance similarly said it was
Responsible developers already work closely with local emergency-response teams, so the new requirements won’t increase their workload appreciably. Many battery firms worry about how the few battery fires that do happen reflect poorly on the industry as a whole; communities debating whether to allow a battery in their proximity might not appreciate the differences in safety between a Moss Landing–era plant and the state of the art today. In that sense, the fact that California has enhanced its battery safety laws could serve the industry better than an absence of new regulations.

As I've known for decades now, Donald Trump lies. He does nothing else. That bears emphasis and repeating - DONALD TRUMP LIES, AND DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE. When Trump's lips are moving, he is lying. When he is awake and breathing, he is lying. While he sleeps, he dreams of more lies. These lies accumulate at an exponential rate, until critical mass is reached and the lies become crimes. So the constant never ending lying is a living, breathing crime wave. An epidemic. A pandemic. Of epochal prortions.

Boyd’s home is among the roughly 1400Energy Savers Network has assisted with weatherization since its inception in late 2016
But Boyd’s story is somewhat unique. She’s in a smaller subset of people who’ve benefited from a Duke initiative meant not just to aid the energy burdened in times of crisis, but to permanently reduce their electricity use through home efficiency improvements.
And with politicians at the state and national levels turning against the clean energy transition in low-income communities and elsewhere, Boyd’s experience is rare good news that advocates hope can continue to be replicated.
## From utility bill assistance to energy efficiency
Energy Savers Network found Boyd through Duke’s Customer Assistance Program. Part of a side deal the utility struck in 2023 to lessen the blow of its rate hikes, the program offers a monthly credit of up to $4215050000
In 2024
North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services manages the two funds and has a data-sharing agreement with Duke, which then enrolls customers in its program — a process that has minimized administrative expenses such as vetting participants for eligibility.
And though in its first year the bill assistance benefited less than half the number of households forecast, experts say that’s because funding for the two buckets of federal aid dropped, not because the need isn’t great. Advocates remain bullish about the prospect for Duke to serve 100000
Totaling over $500
But Boyd’s case demonstrates the full potential of the Customer Assistance Program: Virtually every household receiving help gets referred to a local entity that can assess homes and perform free efficiency upgrades, reducing energy burdens beyond the 12
## **“**
The brainchild and passion project of former financial and utility consultant Brad Rouse, Energy Savers has undergone a few iterations over its nine years of existence. Its throughline is providing energy-efficiency retrofits, usually in a day’s time, via a team of volunteers guided by a professional.
When everything is running smoothly, that means the group can perform upgrades — such as adding insulation and sealing air leaks — for at least three homes a week, according to Rouse. But in its early years, Energy Savers sometimes struggled to meet that mark.
““
But now, the organization has almost eliminated that problem. “
That’s because the utility sends so many referrals that it’s easier to find clients who will be ready by the time the Energy Savers team arrives, reducing the likelihood of cancellations. And when a client does fall through, there’s a waiting list ready to be tapped.
The group identifies households in need through multiple channels, including farmers markets, community events, and word of mouth. But its largest source of referrals these days is the Customer Assistance Program, said Steffi Rausch, director of operations.
“
Boyd, for instance, first got help paying her utility bills through Asheville Buncombe Community Christian Ministry, which accessed one of the federal crisis assistance funds for her. She was soon enrolled in Duke’s $42“

To be sure, Duke and advocates for low-income customers are still working out kinks in the bill-credit scheme. One challenge is waning funding for the two federal crisis assistance initiatives that are used to automatically enroll individuals in the Customer Assistance Program. Another hurdle is connecting the dots for recipients, who often don’t realize they’re getting the bill credit or that they’re getting referred to groups like Energy Savers.
Most of all, advocates are mindful that the Customer Assistance Program is in the middle of a three-year pilot phase, and they want to extend it one way or another — as a feature of Duke’s

I have just paid 1000.00 and I am scared to death to see the bill when it comes in . In the last I'll say two years I have had to come up with a huge amount for a light bill. I pay the bill every month .I done the weatherization program last year they came and check out every thing it was done. I called again this year and was told they I couldn't get that again until next year . Well slot has changed here in a year that's obvious . But I am very sincere and thankful the lady here got help.

!A person wearing a blue jacket with white stars holds a paper container filled with food.
(BasSlabbers via Getty Images)
Canary Media’s“ _Eating the Earth” _column explores the connections between the food we eat and the climate we live in.
As a journalist who spent three decades reporting for mainstream media outlets — and specifically as a climate journalist who’s spent the last six years researching the impacts of the food system — here’s my preliminary analysis of President Donald Trump’s rush to cancel congressionally approved climate spending,
It’s bad. It’s all bad.
The thing is, it’s also boring. I like to write nuanced stories explaining complicated issues, but what’s the nuanced take on a climate-denial administration taking climate-denial actions? Is there a more sophisticated analysis of Trump pushing oil and gas, killing battery factories, lying that windmills cause cancer, and blaming the Green New Deal (which Congress never even passed) for the state of the economy than the obvious one: The dude likes fossil fuels and hates the climate?
I doubt it. And I doubt it matters much whether Trump feels this way because he enjoys owning libs, because he’s raking in oil and gas donations, or because he sincerely believes fossil fuels are harmless. Trump aides say he’s simply committed to an all-of-the-above energy-abundance strategy to drive down energy costs, but that’s bogus. It’s some-of-the-above. He’s throttling wind and solar projects that provide cheap power. He’s pushing tariffs that drive up energy prices. He gaslights and defunds and deregulates like a fossil-fuel shill; he’s a fossil-fuel shill.
So now what? As I’ve been preparing to bring back my Eating the Earth column after some time off to finish
These are hard questions, harder than a lot of keyboard warriors make it sound. Bad things are happening, and more bad things will happen, but not all the things will be equally bad, and it will be counterproductive to turn the freak-out dial up to 11
What matters is what happens, how bad it gets, and what progress can be made in the parts of climate world Trump doesn’t control. The next four years will be a good time to figure out the best climate technologies and policies, even though the U.S. government won’t pursue them. And there will be plenty of non-boring things to say about them.
I’m a little biased here — did I mention that
Sharp-eyed readers of Carl Hiaasen’s raucous 2020“““““
It’s a funny book, if not a subtle one, with — spoiler alert! — a satisfying post-2020“412
Of course, in the real world, he’s not.
In the wake of the 202021st
But instead, we’re back in cuckooville, joining only Iran, Libya, and Yemen in rejecting the Paris accord. Every day, there’s news about Trump rolling back climate programs and climate aid while axing environmental bureaucrats and environmental rules. It’s not a lot more subtle than Hiaasen’s depiction of Mastodon as “
The media have an obvious responsibility to chronicle the carnage — I’d recommend focusing less on what Trump says than what he does — but honestly, I wouldn’t suggest that readers bum themselves out by doomscrolling through all the coverage. For example, the best place to find news about the clean energy transition happens to be an outlet called Canary Media, but unless it’s your job to track this stuff, you’ll make yourself crazy if you read every Canary story about a wind project biting the dust or a solar company in trouble. What you should read are Canary’s big-picture stories about how the U.S. is still on track to install more grid batteries than ever, blue states are moving forward with green programs, and Europe is unveiling a clean industrial policy that would counteract Trump’s fossil-fueled approach.
These days, the most useful and interesting clean energy stories — again, Canary is all over them — are about the post-Trump future. Like Eric Wesoff’s dive into fusion, “4050report on the prospects for turning methane into clean hydrogen. Or Maria Gallucci’s look at the vast potential of geothermal power. The fate of these technologies will probably have a bigger impact on 2050
In general, it’s smart not to hyperventilate about every move Trump makes to delay the clean energy transition, because the transition is happening. It really matters how long the transition takes, because energy generates two-thirds of the world’s greenhouse gases, but we basically know where it’s headed: toward a largely electrified economy powered by zero-emissions electricity.
What we don’t know is what the hell is going to happen with the other third of the emissions warming the planet, the greenhouse gases generated by our food and agriculture system. That system has not yet begun making a transition to a climate-friendlier approach. There’s not even a consensus about what that kind of transition would look like.
That will be the subject of my Eating the Earth columns, and also of my book —
I explained our basic food and climate problem in my first Eating the Earth column: We’ll need to grow about 50205075
So we can’t stay on our current trajectory.
Until recently, there was only dim public awareness of any connection between food and climate — a vague (and, it turns out, incorrect) sense that GMOs, pesticides, and industrial agriculture in general are climate killers, while eating local, natural, and organic is climate-friendly. The 20232024“
In fact, farming has a huge effect on climate change — more than transportation or industry, nearly as much as electricity. And while the rise of renewables has helped our energy and climate problem start getting a little better, though not nearly fast enough, our food and climate problem is still getting worse. Food is about 2525
The good news is that there are dozens of promising solutions that could help us eat less of the earth. I’ve written about some of them: using fewer biofuels, eating chicken instead of beef, intensifying cattle pastures, and getting over our fear of high-tech meat substitutes. I promoted technological solutions like low-emissions fertilizers and a miracle tree called pongamia, while questioning whether vertical farming would ever pencil out. (It certainly
Trump, needless to say, does not care. His administration is already trying to shut down President Joe Biden’s $23“was actually climate-smart, so it’s hard to say what effect this particular knee-jerk anti-climate response will have on global emissions. On the other hand, the Trump team has approved a billion-dollar Biden administration clean-energy loan for a Montana refinery to make “ a supposedly climate-friendly alternative to fossil fuel that may well end up eating much more of the earth.
The next four years, when serious climate policy is on hold in the U.S., will be a good time to piece together which of this stuff makes sense. Climate has become a partisan culture-war issue, but food and farming are still nonpartisan. Trump’s unconventional health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is likely to clash with his conventional agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, over issues like seed oils, GMOs, and agri-chemicals, and Democrats are likely to face internal conflicts over those issues as well. Climate progress won’t happen around energy as long as Trump is in charge, but it’s at least conceivable and debatable around food.
At the very least, Trump’s second term will offer an opportunity to fill in knowledge gaps that could come in handy the next time there’s a president who actually wants to do something about global warming. Four years ago, a lot of us envisioned his story ending like Mastodon’s ended in ““
Instead, Trump’s got more power than ever, and he’s going to use it to block solutions to two-thirds of the climate problem. We might as well try to figure out the other one-third.

While our federal government is cutting (way) back on subsidizing clean energy, the bottom line seems to be that solar combined with battery systems is now less expensive than natural gas/oil. Heat pumps in most areas are more energy efficient (cost wise) than fossil fuel based heating systems.
Data centers, need, power energy usage is growing. The private data centers are going to end up providing their own electricity. They will do solar/battery, or similar. Don't expect any of them to build a natural gas power supplies. Now that clean (or cleaner) energy is less expensive than fossil fuels they will continue to be almost all new energy construction, without any help from subsidies.
Transportation is the weak link. Seems we're even getting close to using electric economically for industrial uses - steel making, etc. In other words, for the most part, the US is going to continue to get greener without subsidies.

A tractor operated by agricultural cooperative Landus spreads ammonia fertilizer made by Talusag's modular, solar-powered green ammonia facility in Boone, Iowa. (Landus)
Modern farming depends on massive amounts of ammonia fertilizer, almost all of it made from fossil gas in enormous chemical plants. These facilities use high heat and pressure to split that gas, mostly made up of methane, into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere, and the hydrogen is mixed with air, where it bonds with the nitrogen under high pressure via the century-old Haber-Bosch process.
The resulting ammonia is a carrier for the nitrogen that plants crave, but producing it this way is highly carbon-intensive, accounting for

That’s fairly straightforward in the markets that Iwanaga and his team initially targeted. The startup launched in 2021“
But even in America’s agricultural heartland, Talusag can propose long-term contracts at set prices at or below the cost of ammonia shipped via pipeline from the Gulf Coast and then by tanker trucks to further-flung farms, Iwanaga said.
There’s an important caveat to that, however. Talusag’s ammonia is only cost-effective in U.S. markets if generous federal incentives for producing hydrogen with low or zero carbon emissions remain in place — a prospect that is looking increasingly uncertain.
## Can small-scale green ammonia plants supply cheaper, more reliable fertilizer?
Talusag’s facilities use electrolyzers to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. The gas, commonly called “ is then fed into miniaturized versions of the gigantic Haber-Bosch reactors at industrial ammonia plants. That chemical process yields no greenhouse gas emissions — and if it uses clean electricity, it’s completely carbon-free.
Those green credentials are a nice “
Landus was first introduced to Talusag back in 2022“
The Talusag offering ““
Iwanaga noted that Landus isn’t taking on financial risk with these projects. Talusag pays for building and producing its green ammonia. That structure puts the pressure on Talusag to deliver on the quality and the low price it has promised to buyers.
But it also potentially provides the company with the long-term revenues it needs to secure project financing, rather than relying on equity capital. Talusag raised a
## The economic balancing act for green ammonia in the U.S.
Shorter supply lines and fixed long-term prices are valuable features of Talusag’s modular model for producing green ammonia. But Iwanaga conceded that the company’s future in U.S. markets hinges on a key federal incentive that may not be around much longer — the 45 hydrogen production tax credit created by the Inflation Reduction Act.
Last week, Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a reconciliation bill that calls for all but eliminating the federal clean energy tax credits created under the IRA2025
Talusag’s two projects in Iowa would squeak under that deadline, and the company may be able to start additional projects before year’s end, Iwanaga said. But if the final bill does kill the 45 credit, that would rule out starting up any other U.S. projects for the foreseeable future, he said.
Robin Gaster, research director at the Center for Clean Energy Innovation at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation think tank in Washington, D.C., noted that would-be commercial-scale producers of ammonia fertilizer made from green hydrogen face a tough road in U.S. markets.
““
The economics of green hydrogen production do not stand up on their own without subsidies like the 45 tax credit, he said. Today, hydrogen produced in the U.S. with fossil gas — referred to as “12green hydrogen costs $5. “
Crowe noted that there’s an important distinction between green hydrogen used to make ammonia for agriculture and green hydrogen that could potentially be used for industries such as trucking, shipping, and steelmaking. Farmers need ammonia now, and enormous quantities of gray hydrogen are already being used to produce it, while retooling industries like trucking and shipping to use hydrogen would require massive investments in new systems and infrastructure.
The on-again, off-again nature of U.S. clean hydrogen policy has made long-term commitments to green ammonia a tough sell. Some companies that announced ambitious plans to produce green ammonia in 20232024more stringent clean-energy tracking rules for the 45 credit than industry groups had hoped for. Cutting off the tax credit completely would make the economics of such projects even worse.
Iwanaga pointed out that Talusag’s technology has some advantages over large green ammonia projects, however. For one, the company’s modular systems can be manufactured and deployed in small increments, an advantage over gigantic chemicals facilities, so that exposes Talusag’s investors to less risk, he said.
Talusag’s systems were also designed expressly to run on intermittent clean power, like the solar power serving off-grid or remote farms that were its initial target customers, he said. Most electrolyzer technologies don’t perform as efficiently when they’re forced to ramp up and down frequently to follow fluctuations in power supply. Talusag must deal with those challenges as well, but has incorporated several design features that minimize the efficiency losses, he said.
Talusag’s green ammonia technology isn’t the only one designed to use solar and wind power when it’s available. But being able to do that is a prerequisite not just for systems that rely on their own solar power, but also for grid-connected systems trying to capture the cheapest power available — which more and more frequently is also the cleanest.
Take the wind energy that makes up an increasing share of the electricity flowing across Midwest power grids. Iowa is the second-largest wind power producer after Texas, 20232023
Wind farms produce when the wind is blowing, which isn’t always when most customers are using electricity — and the more surplus wind power is available, the cheaper it is, Iwanaga said. That creates strong long-term prospects for using excess wind energy to make hydrogen, which could eventually make up for the absence of federal clean-hydrogen incentives, Iwanaga said — even if the economics aren’t there yet.
A similar concept has informed a 201320237
Rural electric cooperatives — member-owned and -operated entities that supply power to the most sparsely populated parts of the country — may also be interested in green ammonia projects that can capture the value of wind power that might otherwise need to be curtailed, Iwanaga said. “
Gaster noted that access to cheap electricity could allow green hydrogen to compete economically with traditional ammonia production. “
It’s hard to say how the climate benefit of making green ammonia might stack up alongside the benefit of producing green ammonia locally, Iwanaga said. “
Crowe said that Landus hasn’t yet considered the prospects of earning money from the carbon emissions prevented by buying Talusag’s green ammonia. “

California is throwing away a lot of solar power.
The state curtailed 340093 _
_
When the sun shines bright and the breeze blows hard, solar panels and wind turbines often produce more power than the grid needs or can handle. In those moments, the grid operator will order power plant owners to reduce their output. That’s called curtailment, and it’s common in places like California that have lots of renewables.
It’s no surprise that California is having to curtail power as it adds more solar to the grid — but curtailments are rising faster in the state than renewable generation capacity is growing. Last year, curtailments jumped by 29202312
Curtailments are at their highest in California during the spring, when the sun is strong enough to generate a lot of solar power but mild weather keeps air-conditioning use, and thus electricity demand, in check.
With power demand rising around the country thanks in large part to the rapid rollout of AI, and with
There are a few ways to do that. California can continue to push buildings, vehicles, and industrial operations to electrify, creating more demand to soak up what is now surplus solar. It can support the construction of interstate transmission lines that would allow it to export more power to states with less solar generation.
The state can also build lots and lots of batteries to store extra solar produced during the day for use in the evening. In fact, it’s already doing that. It has installed more utility-scale storage than any other state, and the sector has grown rapidly in recent years: California had a total of 8GW2023
In order to stop wasting clean electricity, California will need to sustain that battery boom in the face of significant federal policy headwinds — and place some bets on other, more elusive solutions like transmission and long-duration energy storage.

Interesting article, but ""lots and lots of batteries"" needs discussion. Batteries are high capital cost items, and the capital cost must be paid off in annual loan repayments (with interest) of, say, $D/year. If you use a 1 GWh output battery installation nightly, you get a storage added cost of $D/365 per GWh, and you're (probably) in good shape. But if you're storing energy for a month or more, you're only using it 12 times per year or less, and the cost per GWh is at least $D/12, thirty times higher! For any kind of long-term storage, we need much less expensive options. -Richard Leigh

Curtailment is inevitable with renewables, in particular for seasonal reasons. Solar for example can be 30% as effective in winter vs summer in many locations, so to handle winter with near 100% solar during the day, need three times the capacity compared to summer. And batteries are currently good only for several hours, no way suitable for seasonal storage. Currently there are no viable technologies for long term storage, and none on the horizon. Hydrogen is not viable less than 50% round trip efficiency and cost prohibitive ! If solar is cheap, best to just curtail !

Next month the Intermountain power plant comes on board and will soak up some of the solar that is being curtailed. The use will be the creation of green hyrdrogen to be used on the recently installed J power turbines that can burn hydrogen mixed with natural gas. 30% hydrogen mix to start. To facilitate the green hydrogen creation they will seek out cheap solar. It remains to be seen how this balances out.

Jackie, I agree. The issue illustrates that we are wasting a lot of energy (no pun) and time by attempting a bottom-up, piecemeal approach to net zero. The quickest solution requires the use of existing technologies in a top-down systems engineering approach. If climate change is the profound threat to national security that scientists say it is, we need to do what we did to build the war machine for WWII. That was a top-down systems approach, as are virtually all engineering solutions.

The title should also include we are using more clean energy than ever! The installed battery base has gone from 0 to 15GW (45GWH) in just 5 years which has allowed us to use more PV energy. Yes, it is frustrating to see the regular PV curtailment, but I'm convinced we'll find a way to use the free energy aside from battery storage. Note, curtailment will remain a chronic choice while renewables are being added, and we are just at the beginning.

There's no current battery technology that can provide the kind of energy storage that utilities require. Current storage is 4-hour storage, which is daily, or ""short-term."" Utilities also require long-term - days of storage, and seasonal - months of storage.
The only current technology that can provide short-term, long-term, and seasonable is hydrogen, using high pressure hydrogen gas vessels (not underground salt caverns). But that technology requires a top-down systems approach (enhanced grid, pipelines, storage infrastructure, electrolyzers and fuel cells) in building the new green energy infrastructure. The current, piecemeal, bottom-up approach cannot utilize the enormous advantage hydrogen technologies provide. That's why hydrogen doesn't have a chance on the current marketplace.
The entire nation must address this issue with a centralized management that oversees a top-down systems approach, which is the approach taken by all engineering solutions to technical issues. This is what the nation did to build the war machine for WWII, to put a man on the moon, and in the Manhattan Project. The capitalist approach based on the marketplace was not capable of providing those solutions.

Almost all of this curtailment happens in the spring when loads are low and hydro generation is high. (And California has had 3 wet years in a row.) The solution is quite simple--turn off Diablo Canyon from Mar 1 to May 31 every spring. The amount of the curtailment is equal to about 3 months of Diablo generation which aligns with this solution. I wrote about this solution here:

This is good news. With clean power generation ahead of the curve this allows focus on long term storage (lots of start and scale up in this space) and transmission (time to invest in infrastructure) as the demand picks up but also demand management via AI. Energy transition is not just moving from from hydrocarbons to electrons, it is also modernizing as we go. Keep going.

This article does not correctly take into account the reasons for the curtailments. It assumes most of them are relating to insufficient demand, which is not always the case. CAISO reports curtailments as either ""Local"" or ""System"". System curtailments are due to the overall demand situation, as covered in the article. Local curtailments are due to congestion, though CAISO does not specify at what level the congestion takes place. In those instances, there is insufficient transfer capacity on the lines to allow renewables to meet demand on the system. Local curtailments are significant and are a growing portion of total CAISO curtailments. System-level solutions (untargeted storage) and shifting system demand won't help that much.

Blocking major energy projects from coming online is not exactly consistent with declaring an energy emergency.
And yet, the Revolution Wind pause is just one example of how the administration is stymieing clean energy deployment. In recent months, it has rolled back federal subsidies and grants and implemented new federal leasing rules under which renewables are doomed to fail. Because of these policies, the country is expected to build widely agree will raise power prices.
In fact, the only place the administration has acted as if its emergency is real is when it comes to preserving fossil-fuel power plants on the brink of closure.
The U.S. Department of Energy recently extended its emergency order barring a Michigan coal plant from retiring — a decision that cost the plant’s owner $29DOEextended another order keeping a Pennsylvania gas- and oil-fired peaker plant online. Regional grid operators had previously deemed both plants safe to close.
The moves reveal the incoherence at the heart of Trump’s energy policy, which exploits a questionable emergency to prop up expensive and unnecessary fossil-fueled power plants on the one hand — and blocks the fastest-growing and lowest-cost form of energy on the other.

When we think of solar, we tend to picture shimmering expanses of panels spread across farmland or mounted on rooftops. But how about attached to a raft, floating atop a reservoir?
Floating solar photovoltaics, also called “floatovoltaics,” is an emerging technology that’s taken off in countries across Asia and Europe, especially near urban areas with limited space available for land-based solar.
It’s also an untapped resource for the U.S. clean energy transition, 1476100

Even under the most conservative scenario the researchers considered, the potential of floating solar equals more than half of the solar capacity required for a fully carbon-free grid in the U.S. in 2050
Besides minimizing land use, floating solar shades water bodies, which reduces evaporation and conserves limited water supply at reservoirs. Water also cools down the panels, making them
But so far, floating solar only makes up a tiny fraction of the U.S. solar market and is mostly limited to small-scale projects, including at a wastewater treatment plant in 89
Compare that with projects like Thailand’s “10MW
Floatovoltaics are often installed on reservoirs, water treatment ponds, and other human-made bodies of water, as currents, tides, and salt water
The NREL
Researchers narrowed down which sites could feasibly host floating solar based on a range of technical criteria. For example, overly shallow reservoirs and those with strong currents were excluded. So were bodies of water located anywhere with extremely low temperatures, since projects typically cannot withstand high amounts of ice and snow.
The remaining federal reservoirs that could support floating solar are scattered across the country, with Texas, California, and Oklahoma taking the lead in potential capacity. More than half of the potential projects could generate between 10MW1123MW
The study didn’t consider social, economic, or legal limits to developing floating solar, such as environmental regulations, the availability of transmission lines, and project costs. Those factors are “NRELenvironmental impacts of floating solar is still nascent,
But this study adds to the growing evidence that floating solar could supercharge clean energy production.

Another possible plus is many reservoirs are also hydro electric plants. So they already have infrastructure in place for the electricity and most dams have an exclusion zone keeping boats away from the dam. The floating solar can effective be that barrier and use the hydro as a partial battery back up. Cut back on hydro during sunny days and allow more flow on cloudy days and at night. So great utility at very little additional costs.

I wrote a skeptical column about then-President Joe Biden’s climate-smart approach back in 2022 so I had mixed feelings when the Trump administration cancelled the climate-smart commodities program this April. It was clearly a flawed program. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins had a point when she mocked it as slow and bureaucratic. While her primary complaint that it didn’t send enough money directly to farmers wasn’t my primary complaint — “
But no one truly believes the program’s cancellation had much to do with flaws in its design or execution. Its fatal flaw, from the Trump perspective, was obviously its climate-smart premise; Rollins slagged it as “““USDA
Nobody who’s concerned about the planet should be happy that an imperfect agricultural program was cancelled for the sin of trying to reduce agricultural emissions. As University of Iowa economist Silvia Secchi, one of the program’s harshest critics, puts it, ““
When President Donald Trump commits egregious transgressions — deporting a Venezuelan hairdresser to El Salvador or investigating the mayor of Chicago for bragging about his diverse staff — pundits often try to look balanced by criticizing the suboptimal behaviors he uses as excuses: Biden neglected the border; DEI
Well, I spent the last six years reporting USDA
But I’ve also pointed out that it’s boring to harp on the badness of a climate-denial administration doing climate-denial things. And there are lessons we can learn from the politics and substance of the climate-smart partnerships — about mistakes that shouldn’t be repeated, and at least one remarkable success story that should be expanded worldwide.
## What is climate-smart ag? A federal experiment to find out is over.
In my book, I tell the tale of a big internal Biden administration fight over climate-smart agriculture that never made it into the public eye.
On one side was then-Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who wanted to pay farmers to adopt regenerative practices — like keeping soils covered and minimizing soil disturbance — that he believed would sequester carbon in their soils and help reverse climate change. He loved the idea of fifth-generation Republican dirt farmers who wore John Deere hats and drove Ford F-150
On the other side was White House climate aide David Hayes, who thought soil carbon was wildly overhyped — by the United Nations, environmentalists, foundations who seemed to cough up cash whenever they heard the word ““
Hayes was right about the science. It’s extraordinarily difficult to measure soil carbon accurately or ensure it remains underground. It’s also extraordinarily difficult to build more soil carbon without adding more nitrogen in the form of fertilizer or manure, which have negative climate impacts of their own. 2019
“
!A person wearing a suit speaks into a microphone at a podium in front of a U.S. flag Biden’s agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack (Alex Wong/Getty Images)
But Vilsack won on the politics. Most of the climate-smart grants promoted regenerative practices designed to move atmospheric carbon underground and help build new markets where farmers could sell soil-carbon credits — and the same was true for another $20
If USDA4020
Hayes did pressure USDA300
But the Trump administration is cancelling those data-focused grants, too, part of its push to scrap grants that proposed to send less than 65
The Trump team also axed most of the grants focused on large numbers of small farms growing unconventional crops, because they required much more administration. For example, the Pennsylvania group Pasa Sustainable Agriculture lost a $5920002
““
Robert Bonnie, Vilsack’s deputy who oversaw the grants, says there was a political strategy behind the grant program: By offering farmers carrots rather than sticks, and helping them develop markets for climate-smart commodities regardless of their personal climate views, USDA
“
Again, it’s not the Biden team’s fault that the Trump team hates the climate. But just as many climate hawks now wish the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean-energy provisions had focused more on getting green stuff built quickly, and less on requiring union labor, American-made components, and other conditions unrelated to the climate, it’s tempting to wonder what the climate-smart grants could have achieved before Trump ransacked them if they had focused on delivering quick emissions-reducing results.
Actually, we don’t have to wonder, because a single grant amounting to just 0253
## Soil carbon wasn’t ​“
Four years ago, when a 23
But once he dug into the science and mechanics of soil carbon capture, Hull concluded it was mostly bogus. He calculated that farmers could at best sequester one-fifth of a ton of carbon underground per acre, so they would earn less selling credits than they would spend on seeds for cover crops — and since tilling the soil in the future would release the sequestered carbon, the carbon-credit agreements would prohibit any tillage on the land for decades.
““
Hull soon stumbled across an emissions-reduction opportunity that wasn’t bogus at all: reducing methane from rice fields through better water management. Methane-producing microbes that thrive in flooded rice fields are responsible for 10““
AgriCapture received a $752022300002500091500005
If rice farmers worldwide all adopted these practices, they could eliminate enough emissions to offset half the aviation industry.
““
Regenerative agriculture is sexy and popular, with support from Al Gore, Joe Rogan, Rosario Dawson, the Indian mystic Sadhguru, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but its ability to move a lot of carbon from sky to soil remains speculative at best. By contrast, AgriCapture’s effort to reduce methane by reducing flooding on rice fields is simple, effective, and potentially lucrative.
There are also proven strategies to reduce methane from cow burps with feed additives, reduce nitrous oxide emissions by using fertilizer more efficiently, and store carbon above ground by planting trees and shrubs in pastures and fields — with climate benefits that are relatively easy to measure and monetize. The Biden team could have made an international splash by bringing those strategies to scale, if it hadn’t been so excited about its soil-carbon experiment.
Now that experiment is over, and that’s Trump’s fault.
But in the future, if policymakers who do care about climate progress want to make climate action more popular with the public, they might want to focus on actions they know will help the climate. And if those actions can create measurable environmental benefits that farmers can get paid for, they might even be popular in farm country.

Clean energy leaders have spent the months since the November election hoping that the sheer economic dynamism their factories inject into Republican congressional districts could overcome President Donald Trump’s desire to unravel Joe Biden’s legacies. It didn’t help that the Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act, with its many highly targeted tax credits for clean energy deployment and manufacturing, on a party-line vote.
![]( States that reelected President Donald Trump in 2024 also host the lion’s share of the domestic clean energy factories, which bring relatively high-wage jobs to their communities. (ACP)
But enough Republican representatives publicly argued against a wholesale repeal of the credits to give cleantech insiders hope. Indeed, the House Ways and Means Committee declined to eradicate the credits entirely in its budget proposal from last week. But the proposed tweaks to many of the individual programs narrow their scope and could render them wholly unworkable nonetheless.

The manufacturing job count could grow to 57900020301340002024
A Canary Media visit to the enormous QCells solar factory in Dalton, Georgia, last year showed why this work pays more than traditional manufacturing. The brand-new factories leverage considerable automation and robotic assistance for the heavy lifting and repetitive, high-precision tasks. Workers patrolled the lines and intervened when the machinery needed help. That greater output of an in-demand, high-tech product supported considerably higher pay than the carpet factories down the road.

Across cleantech factories, annual earnings from clean energy manufacturing averaged $11800076000
It’s not just immediate employees who benefit, though. First comes the intensive but temporary construction phase. Once complete, the factories create additional work for support services in the region, such as shipping and delivery companies, food vendors, hotels for visiting customers, and waste disposal. Domestic manufacturing also relies on other component suppliers: Utility-scale solar panels sit on American steel trackers, covered in U.S.-made solar glass. The authors calculate that each job in a clean energy factory leads to three more in supporting industries.
![]( U.S. energy-related factories have opened at a steady clip over the last four years, bolstered by growing demand and targeted industrial policies. (ACP)
This reality sounds a lot like the vision that Trump campaigned on last year, of growing jobs at home by restoring U.S. manufacturing from the ravages of globalization. He also repeatedly emphasizes a desire to secure more critical minerals for the U.S.; clean energy technologies provide much of the expected demand growth for those minerals.

Trump’s coal-boosting efforts don’t make sense
The Trump administration keeps trying to prop up fossil-fuel power plants. Experts and regulators say it’s an uneconomical and unwise mission.
President Donald Trump’s coal-boosting endeavors kicked off last month with a slate of executive orders that would let the U.S. Energy Department order power plants to stay open and would exempt some coal plants from air-pollution regulations. Among those facilities targeted for reinstatement is the Cholla coal plant in Arizona, which shut down in March, and which a state energy regulator 2

Bad news/​good news for greener steel
A potential deal between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, backed by President Trump, would likely be bad news for efforts to clean up steelmaking. A week ago, Trump announced that Japan’s Nippon Steel was set to acquire U.S. Steel in a deal whose details are yet to be disclosed. Nippon has previously pledged to extend the life of U.S. Steel’s coal-burning furnaces, Alexander C. Kaufman reported for Canary Media this week, and to build a new electric arc furnace in the U.S. should the deal go through.
Meanwhile, Massachusetts-based Boston Metal is honing a greener steelmaking process of its own. The start-up is developing a technique that uses electricity to remove contaminants from iron ore, the company told Canary Media’s Sarah Shemkus. Refining iron ore is responsible for most of steelmaking’s emissions, but in Boston Metal’s process, the only greenhouse gas emissions created come from the electricity used to power it.

Kowalski: I was struck by the focus they used of how dark money and gerrymandering undermined voters’ will in the wake of a 2010
Haugen: Was there any factual information that wasn’t previously reported by you or others?
Kowalski: A lot of it was very familiar, given the fact that I had read through most of the exhibits, read FBIGOP
Haugen: Did the film change your understanding of the HB6
Kowalski: They did a decent job connecting some dots. I had not thought through how former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder’s actions also enabled a far-right coalition in the Legislature to push through an anti-abortion law in 2019
Haugen: Where did the abortion legislation appear on the timeline?
Kowalski: The way that the filmmaker presents it is that once Householder helped these people get the anti-abortion legislation passed, he then had people who felt they owed him something. I looked at the timing, and Gov. Mike DeWine signed the anti-abortion legislation the day before House Bill 6
Haugen: One of the biggest unknowns still today is what, if any, role the governor’s office had in all this. You and others have reported on a December 2018
Kowalski: The filmmakers include an allegation of $5JD
Haugen: Did anything in this film make you smile or laugh?
Kowalski: A couple things. First, it starts off with actor Michael Imperioli reading an excerpt from lobbyist Neil Clark’s tell-all book, which was published after Clark, who had been criminally charged for his role in the HB62021FBI
Haugen: So is this something you would recommend that your readers watch?

In the aftermath of South Korea's 2012 massive nuclear scandal (where over 100 people were indicted) I asked during a webinar if there was something about nuclear that lends it towards fraud and corruption. The expert replied that huge budgets - nuclear or otherwise - make fraud and corruption extremely lucrative while jail remains an unlikely prospect. Meanwhile, right after the November election Larry Householder said he will ask President-elect Donald Trump to pardon him. If that happens the 'logical' next step would be for Trump to sue the series producers or Max.

Last week, the interagency nonprofit Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, or NESCAUM
California, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia together committed to ambitious heat-pump adoption goals last year. Washington state joined the pact last week. Their targets: By 203065204090

Heat-pump water heaters work the same way and are improve air quality and typically save people money over the long term, even if, on average, they is trying to change that.)
Heat pumps are slowly catching on. In the U.S., the units outsold gas furnaces by their biggest-ever margin last year, but their share of the market is still modest. Citing data from the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, a trade association, Levin said that in 202125HVAC202432

2. Set an all-electric standard for new buildings. require that most new buildings be electric only, making heat pumps the default heating appliances. The rules withstood a legal challenge in July and take effect on Dec. 31
3. Use building performance standards to encourage heat pumps in existing structures. 35000CO2 emissions starting this year, hit standards by 20302040

Still, ““change their customer economics to make it more attractive to switch to a heat pump.”

Indeed, heat pumps are VERY efficient. However high efficiency does not mean heat pumps are cost effective. For example, in the Albany NY area, the average National Grid utility rates for electricity and natural gas for the three most recent heating seasons was 19.9 cents/kWh and 83.2 cents/therm, respectively. Based on those rates, the annual cost of heating with a heat pump that had a HSPF 4 rating of 11.2 (328% efficiency) was more than double (2.2 times) the annual cost of heating using a 95% efficient natural gas furnace. For the 2023-2024 heating season the annual cost of heating using that same heat pump was more than triple the annual cost of heating using that same 95% efficient natural gas furnace.

The Wood County courthouse in Bowling Green, Ohio, where residents are suing the city over its fees on rooftop solar. (
Utilities tend not to be big fans of rooftop solar, which eats into their revenues by reducing customer reliance on the power grid. A new Ohio lawsuit spotlights the tension between utilities and customers over the clean-energy technology.
The case deals with a monthly charge imposed by the city of Bowling Green’s municipal utility on its few customers with solar panels on their rooftops. Customers who use batteries to store surplus solar power pay even more.
Residents Leatra Harper and Steven Jansto claim the charge, which for them amounts to roughly $56“37000
The city argues the fee is needed to make sure other customers don’t subsidize those with rooftop solar. As households that produce some of their own electricity buy less from the utility, they pay less for fixed costs built into its retail rates, such as staffing, grid equipment, and maintenance. The utility would then look to other customers to make up the difference.
The situation echoes “ that have dogged rooftop solar around the nation. It could also be a preview of a statewide battle to come as the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio gears up to net-metering rules, which determine how solar owners are compensated for the energy they send to the grid. Municipal utilities like Bowling Green are not subject to these rules, but the dynamics around the fairness of rooftop solar rates are similar in either case.
For their part, Harper and Jansto installed rooftop solar panels and battery storage at their home in 20192020

Residential solar doesn’t just help those who invest in it.

Energy fed into the grid from homeowners’ renewable energy systems can save other customers money, too.

The health and environmental benefits of rooftop solar are “rolls back climate policy.

Along those lines, Brian O’Connell, utilities director for Bowling Green, said via email that the city adopted its $4“
The rationale resembles an argument 2014
Consumer advocates and some academics have made similar cases in California, whose solar capacity leads the nation for both

But the documents don’t detail how the utility spends the solar surcharge. It’s unclear whether the rooftop solar fees are helping pay for the Prairie State coal plant: O’Connell’s response to Canary Media’s question merely noted the city still has to purchase energy from the electric market.
Harper and Jansto’s case will move through legal motions and pretrial fact-finding, called discovery, during the coming months. Meanwhile, advocates worry about the broader questions the case raises.

Ultimately, Dutzik said, rate systems still should not discourage people from investing in renewable energy for their homes. Indeed, if high fees delay recovery of investments for too long, ““

Like others in this situation, as in recent years in grid-tied solar in California, many installations have been upgraded with battery energy storage to go off-grid.
Harper & Jansto could add more batteries (possibly solar panels) to go off-grid. There are US-made batteries, so they may not have to pay tariffs for imported batteries.
Then that causes more pain for the utility because it has one less customer to pay for the operational cost of their grid.
There is a municipality utility in New York State that charges $8.00/month even if you are off-grid.
At 2ndLife Batteries, we provide backup power for West African Hospitals, which suffer from blackouts from the grid. For example, a hospital experiences 4-hour blackouts every 2-3 days. That's equivalent to 17 days of 24 hours each day per year. Generators are used during blackouts. When they go off-grid with solar and energy storage, they consider the grid as a backup power source, not the primary power source, and they still have the generators as a third source of power source.
Africa will be develop because of microgrids, not transmitted thousand of miles of power lines.
I mention the African experience not to belittle Harper & Jansto claims. We are very fortunate in the US, and the envy of others overseas.
The economics of solar and battery storage will get less expensive over time so you could go off-grid for less money.
Not advocating cutting the cord for everyone in the US. Putting up a solar panels, and battery storage should not be punished by utility infrastructure expenses, when we are not customers of the utilities.

Ability to go ""off grid"" is a high bar. I've got a lot more solar generation and batteries than most, six Powerwalls and 21 kwh rated capacity generation. Cost? Around $220K before tax credits. I got 30% in tax credits (or will after the coming tax season) but future credits have been stolen. I cannot operate off grid. I can almost self power on an annual basis, but need grid as battery to do so - to the tune of 2.5 mwh. That is my annual ""solar season"" overproduction that I bank to grid and need back to get thru the winter season. 2.5 mwh, for those who aren''t aware, is a smaller grid scale battery module. I doubt I could achieve this with a doubling of my current system investment. Hard to justify, or to find a feasibile path toward. I've actually tried (at a lower level of effort, admittedly) to find and source supply and installation of this. I wholeheartedly support your efforts, what you are doing, and pretty much all you've posted, but if Harper and Jansto read it and begin to plot the path toward off grid living, they'll need to sell their current home and design their off-grid replacement from the ground up - from location, siting, design, supply, and builder, or a small scale EPC project, rather than buy a few more batteries and solar arrays. But more power to you, in any case.

Humans use energy, at an accelerating rate. Our continued survival depends on energy. Residential solar produces useable energy. WELCOME IT, DON'T FIGHT IT. That is the simple part - as always, there is complexity below the surface of Elegance. But again, DON'T FIGHT AGAINST SOMETHING GOOD. Not only is residential solar ""something good"", it is something that could allow humanity to continue to survive. DO NOT FIGHT AGIANST YOUR OWN SURVIVAL. That is the definition of terminal psychosis. FIGHTING SOLAR IS CHOOSING DEATH. I choose life.

Over half of electric rates charged by utilities represent the delivery expense. That is, the expense of delivering electrons from the point of generation to the point of consumption. Utilities purchase electrons from owners of rooftop solar and move those electrons to the nearest point of demand - a neighbor's house next door or across the street. These electrons stay in the neighbrhood. The delivery distance is maybe 200 ft' and the delivery expense negligible. For example, the utility servicing my area, PG&E, pays $.05 per KWH for rooftop electrons, moves them maybe two hundred feet and charges my neighbor $.45 per KWH. A huge profit margin. Then, PG&E tries to equate the delivery expenses of those rooftop electrons with the delivery expenses of electrons it purchases from commercial wholesalers selling their electrons out in the desert or in Neveda, maybe 100-200 miles from the neighbor's house. The cost of delivering those electrons to my neighbor is vastly higher then the cost of delivering my rooftop electrons. PG&E makes a ton of money off my electrons which it could/should pass on to its coustomers; instead it charges me a fee of nearly $13.00 per month, while alleging some sort of ""cost shift "" nonsense...

I am fortunate to live where there is full net metering. I pay a bit under $10 monthly to maintain a grid connection, for 10 billing periods annually. The remaining two billing periods, I buy and am charged for some grid power supply. The more households that do something like we have done, the more pressure is put on the status quo energy supply landscape. Across the US, grid operators and utilities are failing to respond intelligently to this pressure. It's a sad to see. This kind of response, to any pressures, rooted in expediency and ignorance, has become commonplace an is now being institutionalized in our Federal Government. The forces of Sanity must vote. If we are lucky, we'll get one more chance to do that - the upcoming midterm elections, if we fight for them. And fighting for them we will be forced into. They are far from assured, and the groundwork to not have elections at all, or rig the coming midterms and fast track the path toward elimination of elections is well underway.

Community solar can boost local economies, offer farmers a passive source of income, and provide consumers with more energy choices. (Arcadia)
In several states, Republican lawmakers are taking the lead on an unexpected policy priority: encouraging more community solar.
This year, Republicans in Georgia, Iowa, Missouri, and Ohio have sponsored bills to spur the growth of this shared renewable energy resource in their states. Community solar installations, which are typically 1530

That Republicans are advocating for solar at the local level comes as something of a surprise given the federal government’s ongoing opposition to clean energy. On Capitol Hill, GOPattempted to claw back billions of dollars Congress authorized for solar and other clean energy projects. At the same time, the executive branch “
So why is community solar finding fans among some local Republican lawmakers?
These projects brim with benefits, including ones that tap into the conservative principles of free markets and individual property rights, according to advocates.
Community solar policy can attract private investment from third-party developers of these projects, opening up competition in the energy-generation market, which is often dominated by monopoly utilities. All the recently introduced Republican-backed bills would create this competitive structure by allowing third-party-owned projects where they were previously barred, the Coalition for Community Solar Access pointed out.
Companies that own shared solar installations pay property taxes that help fund local schools and emergency services. And these projects provide energy close to where it’s being consumed, which can reduce the costs of building out grid infrastructure to deliver power to far-flung customers.
Plus, community solar can help farmers keep their agricultural land in production. Farmers and ranchers who need to let a few acres lie fallow to regenerate the soil can lease that plot to earn a passive, stable income for 2030
Some of those reasons explain why the American Legislative Exchange Council, the national conservative group known for packaging model legislation for policymakers, agrivoltaics.

That’s a far cry from a common refrain that Lori Saine said she often heard from fellow Republicans during her tenures as a state representative and local official in Colorado: “‘You like China and Biden if you like solar panels.’”
As a commissioner in Weld County, Colorado, Saine helped update the jurisdiction’s code to allow community solar projects, and as a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council, she introduced the group’s model resolution supporting shared solar.
To be sure, even today community solar can be ““

New Hampshire’s new state budget redirects an estimated $15

The renewable energy fund, established in 2007282024153
Earlier this year, the state energy department started laying out plans to use some of this money to support solar projects developed by municipal governments. Such developments have both financial and environmental benefits, saving money for towns — and thus taxpayers — while cutting greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation in a region that relies heavily on natural gas to fuel its power plants.
Still, municipal solar projects can be a hard sell for voters in New Hampshire, a state with a reputation for frugality. The state has no sales tax or income tax, so government operations are funded mainly by hefty property taxes. It is also home to many small towns with constrained budgets. Though solar installations can save a town money, voters are generally reluctant to approve the upfront cost, which could increase their property taxes.

In 2024launched the Municipal Solar Grant Program to help towns overcome those hurdles and install solar panels on municipal property.

Home batteries tend to come in two flavors. There are the no-frills, portable systems meant for emergencies, not for full-on integration with solar panels or the power grid. And then there are the Tesla Powerwalls of the world: smart, large devices that can power an entire home but which require a lot of time and money to install.
Cole Ashman, CEOsmart-electrical-panel startup Span and as a Powerwall engineer at Tesla gave him the technical chops. His experience growing up in New Orleans and witnessing the aftermath of post-Hurricane Katrina power outages gave him the motivation.

Take a refrigerator — one of the most important things to keep powered when the electricity goes out. Ashman recalled seeing thousands of them on New Orleans street curbs following Hurricane Katrina, abandoned after multiday power outages left them filled with spoiled food.
One Pila battery can power a typical refrigerator for 32“
Pila’s batteries don’t just provide value to their owners during blackouts; the devices are also functional when the grid is up and running. They can be programmed to store energy when it’s cheap — say, during midday hours when grid prices are low or rooftop solar is abundant — and deploy that power during afternoon or evening hours, when households often pay higher rates for electricity from utilities.
These are the kinds of features that come standard with large, high-end home batteries like the Tesla Powerwall, sonnenCore+, Enphase IQ1200016000
Pila batteries, by contrast, are what Ashman describes as “

## Expanding the DIY
That puts Pila in a category of “
Take balcony solar systems, which now power
Yet balcony solar hasn’t caught on in the U.S., where electrical codes put strict limits on devices that send power back into household circuits. For now, Pila’s software is configured to only allow power to flow from wall sockets into its batteries, not vice versa, Ashman emphasized.
However, as more states pass laws promoting DIY and as electrical codes evolve to allow intelligently controlled devices to safely deliver power through wall sockets into household circuits, Pila Mesh batteries can flip to serve that task, Ashman said.
The do-it-yourself design also makes Pila batteries suitable for renters and people living in multifamily housing, who are largely locked out of the solar and battery market today, he said — a frustration Ashman himself has experienced as a renter in New York City.
Consumers want to be able to adopt batteries, solar panels, EVCEOovercome barriers to people electrifying their homes.

That ethos is appealing to Mackey Saturday, an investor at R7

Ashman highlighted numerous features that could allow Pila batteries to work together as virtual power plants, starting with the wireless mesh network built into each system. The network runs on a 900“200
Each battery also contains a cellular modem along with WiFi connections to ensure that individual and meshed batteries have multiple ways to stay in contact with their owners, building managers, or utility control centers, Ashman said. That kind of redundancy is a must-have for eventual use as a grid asset, he added.
Pila is in preliminary discussions with utilities on this front, although it isn’t naming any names. But Ashman noted that the startup presented alongside other providers of plug-and-play home-energy tech, like CraftStrom Solar, at a
U.S. utilities have a decidedly mixed track record in terms of how they treat customers installing rooftop solar and backup batteries. Across the country, utilities have campaigned to claw back net-metering incentives for consumers who send solar energy back to the grid, seeing that framework as a threat to electricity sales and a risk to the power system’s stability.
But utility regulators and policymakers are increasingly eager to use these distributed technologies to avoid expensive upgrades to the grid. As electricity demand grows and these cost pressures become more acute, the appeal of systems like Pila’s could grow even larger.

One can purchase an outside portable generator from Home Depot or Lowe's (not the Generac ones), wire it to the main circuit breaker, and power all essential appliances for much cheaper. But, I do understand portable generators are not a feasible option for those living in Housing Developments, Condos and Apartments due to Landlord / Homeowner Association Rules.

It seems to me that net metering is a bad idea - electrical power has different values at different times of day, but beyond that there is a frustrating lack of agreement and scholarly (disinterested) analysis. We can understand the retail and wholesale prices, but coming to terms on what portions of transmission and distribution charges should be borne by back of the meter power producers seems impossible - see California, Hawaii, and now Minnesota. And for all of the people doing study after study after study, we don't get good information that can push us toward consensus on appropriate pricing.
From my perspective (as a non-expert), it seems like (a) straight up net metering (banking a kw for providing a kw) doesn't work, (b) small producers are good because they are investing their own money and there is little permitting hold up, (c) the more clean energy production the better it is for low income households because air pollution tends to cluster in low income neighborhoods (of course that means, that polluting power sources are being shut down), and (d) small solar produces some benefits to the grid, but pricing those benefits is difficult. We also need better systems (not subsidies) for reducing the cost of fully installed solar.

It sure looks like the Trump administration is not going to let any coal plants close down during its term — no matter the cost to consumers and to the climate.
About 27202815
Coal plant retirements have been the 1402011318GW
Now, the U.S. gets more power from wind and solar alone than it does from coal, an extremely carbon-intensive form of energy that provided around half of the country’s electricity at the start of the millennium.
But President Donald Trump is trying to put a stop to coal’s demise. On his first day in office, Trump declared a national energy emergency that experts have called baseless and which is now being challenged by 15“efforts to obstruct clean energy, which for years has accounted for over 90 added to the grid.
Trump has since built on that edict by availing himself of emergency powers to force fossil-fuel plants to stay online past their scheduled retirement.
In May, the Trump administration issued 90stay-open orders for two facilities set to close days later: the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan and the Eddystone oil- and gas-burning plant in Pennsylvania. Trump just reupped those mandates for another 90. Families and businesses will pay the price: The first three months of continuing to operate J.H. Campbell alone could cost consumers as much as $100
And in July, the Department of Energy released a specious report that overstates the risk of grid blackouts. States are attempting to make the agency fix the report, which they expect will be used to justify additional emergency stay-open orders for other coal plants. Blocking all planned closures of fossil-fuel power plants could result in billions of dollars in additional yearly energy costs for consumers by the end of Trump’s term.
The administration’s desire to revive America’s dirtiest form of power will only exacerbate the nation’s brewing utility bill crisis. The price of electricity has been rising for several years, and despite promises of slashing energy costs, Trump’s pro-coal, anti-renewables agenda is making things even worse.

Residential solar could be hampered further by the Trump administration and Republican-controlled Congress.

Months of proactive community engagement appeared to be paying off for the developer of the Grange Solar Grazing Center agrivoltaics project in central Ohio.
Open Road Renewables knew it faced an uphill battle before the state energy-siting board, whose recent deference to local opponents has helped make Ohio one of the most challenging places in the country to build large solar arrays. So the company showed up early and often in Logan County, listening to residents’ feedback and committing millions of dollars in donations for community investments.
As public comments rolled into state regulators, the developer reviewed the submissions last month and found a clear majority of those weighing in supported its plan. The analysis filtered out hundreds of repeat comments, at least 14016
Optimism around Grange Solar lasted only days, however. On Feb. 21“
Open Road Renewables withdrew its application for Grange Solar late last week, making it at least the fifth large solar project in Ohio to be canceled over the past 15
The case highlights the power that local opponents have to block renewable energy projects in Ohio, even when they otherwise check all the boxes for regulatory approval. It also raises the question: What more can developers do?

“
The section of the siting board staff’s report that focuses on whether Grange Solar serves the public interest does not discuss local benefits. Nor does it address statewide public-interest issues, such as growing energy needs, efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and projected positive economic impacts.
The staff report also does not address conflict-of-interest issues and procedural problems raised by the developer about some of the local governments’ filings. And it doesn’t mention the company’s analysis of public comments, showing that three-fourths of those who had commented on the project supported it.
The staff recommendation also does not consider the merits of opponents’ reasons for not wanting Grange Solar to move ahead.

Renewable energy developments face increasing headwinds across the country, often fueled by misinformation. Research released last June by Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law identifies hundreds of projects encountering significant opposition 2024
Withdrawing the Grange Solar application was a difficult business decision, Herling said in a phone interview with Canary Media. Management at the company felt it could have eventually won, if not at the Ohio Power Siting Board then perhaps on appeal. But even if the company did prevail, it had no guarantee on how long that would take. And Grange Solar is not the only site Open Road Renewables has been working on.

Known as the data center capital of the world, Virginia offers a crucial test case for electric utilities: Can they meet power demand from the explosion of AI
Many experts fear that Dominion Energy, Virginia’s largest utility, is failing that test.
In July, the company won approval from state regulators for its plan to construct a raft of new fossil-fueled plants over the next 152045
Now, Dominion is asking the same regulators for permission to build the first of those facilities: a 944““
But in a flurry of paper filings over the last month, clean energy advocates and industry groups disagreed — acknowledging a growing demand for power but maintaining that Dominion ignored a range of alternatives in order to justify the new gas complex. Even the nonpartisan expert staff for the regulatory body, the State Corporation Commission, criticized Dominion’s rationale for the permit.

But in written testimony filed with regulators in recent weeks, multiple experts rejected Dominion’s conclusions on both reliability and cost-effectiveness.

Detractors poked holes in Dominion’s economic analysis, arguing it unnecessarily restricted these alternatives. For the Sierra Club, Glick developed a carbon-free portfolio that would cost about the same as the gas complex, without the downsides of pollution and the volatile price of fossil fuels that would be borne by customers.
Shawn Kelly, Virginia-based regulatory director for Advanced Energy United, says the flaws in Dominion’s application stem from the utility’s desire to build the Chesterfield complex no matter what. The company, he said in his “

And yet, despite all those misgivings, staff did not oppose approval of the Chesterfield project, suggesting Dominion had left regulators little choice in the face of rising electricity demand.
Delaying construction of the plant or considering new alternatives, Smith argued, “

Three bills have advanced through the California Legislature that are meant to increase the use of virtual power plants as a way to rein in energy costs. While good news for utility customers, that welcomed progress comes with its own dose of bad news: The most ambitious proposals were stripped out of one of the bills in a secretive process inaccessible even to the bill’s author.

## How VPPs can help California’s grid
For a handful of hours every year in California, often on the hottest days, electricity use soars beyond the usual day-to-day level and hits what’s known as peak demand. To meet these peaks, utilities have historically opted to build more power plants and power lines than they need on a daily basis — an expensive choice that is responsible for a large portion of utility bills.
But California can reduce demand peaks and make a big dent in those costs by taking advantage of solar-charged batteries, smart thermostats, EVVPP

This is very disappointing. The distribution grid data is critical and it is the most opaque part of our grids.
I always assumed that the bill's author had to be involved in this type of last minute changes.
The appropriations phase of our Legislature is the least democratic part of it; no representation and no accountability.
Thanks for this great article.

Sadly California has restructured (slashed) the pricing the big utilities pay solar rooftop owners (at least residential). This has resulted in a massive drop in new residential solar installations. Even if CA mandates new homes must have solar, there are so few new homes being built in CA (a pathetic number), that even requiring solar rooftops isn't likely to move the needle.
How badly is rooftop solar doing in California. perhaps ChatGPT, CA peaked in 2023, with the new rate structures brining about a 45% decline in added capacity for 2024. 2025 may be even worse. You have to go back to 2017 to find a year with less new capacity added, despite solar being a good deal more efficient today.
At least the sales of battery systems for residential has taken off, likely for the same reason, without the high payouts, and the ridiculously high California cost of electricity per kilowatt hour (over double the US average), solar owners would rather store the energy at home and rely less on SCE, PGE and SDGE in order to save a bundle!

What’s crazy is while I shop cost per kilowatt of grid connected versus non grid connected home batteries, and see I can easily get the minimum 10 kW a small home needs for emergency safety, at about half the cost of being grid tied ( less convenient use case but with inconvenient times in mind) I know I am wasting the value I could share to the grid. The aggressive VPP plans are out of style. So because of what you write, I can see it must be only the profit guaranteed to utilities rule, is the only rational reason why I have to waste my ability to use my own resources to contribute to others by sustaining myself. So this is why me as regular homeowner peak shifting ( and resilience planning) is a throw away value by entities that are set up to profit from unmet need. What planet can afford this kind of waste? Those charged with public good are being disincentivized by this rule of easy income stream. So this is why they wont buy my and my neighbors excess storage. So this is why DERs ability to aggregate is not helped or incentivised. So this sure looks to me like banking and profiting off of ignorance and profiting off maintaining and keeping the vulnerability of those vulnerable to both Outages and energy poverty. The point how simplest math shows they can’t even build infrastructure fast enough and time and space limits the profit flow to the big through this drive a truck through it regulatory gimme. So That’s what grants “ consumers” wanting to consume less of the golden peak generation, our certifiable and insured roadkill status. This I’ve really been wondering. Great article, thank you.

!Drilling rig drills boreholes for Dandelion Energy's ground-source geothermal systems being built into new homes from Lennar
A drilling rig drills boreholes in the Ken-Caryl Ranch development in Littleton, Colorado. The boreholes are part of the Dandelion Energy geothermal ground-source heat pumps being integrated into newly built homes from Lennar. (Dandelion Energy)
Ground-source heat pumps, which tap into the stable temperatures found hundreds of feet beneath the Earth’s surface, are a super-efficient way to heat and cool homes. They’re also quite expensive to install in existing houses.
There’s a pretty straightforward reason: It’s hard to drill in a residential neighborhood. Hiring contractors to fit rigs into tight single-family yards and drill boreholes in places where utility infrastructure crisscrosses underfoot is a lot more complicated and expensive than installing an air-source heat pump, fossil-gas furnace, or other standard, aboveground HVAC
But what if you could bore hundreds of holes at a time across a patch of cleared land and then build heat pump–equipped houses on top of them? That should be a lot cheaper. In fact, it could make ground-source heat pumps about as cheap as traditional HVAC
On Wednesday, Google X spinout 1500
The goal is simple, Kathy Hannun, Dandelion’s founder and president, told Canary Media: “
Just being able to tackle hundreds of boreholes at a time should more than halve the drilling costs that burden existing home retrofits, she said. Large-project economies of scale and designing homes around the high-efficiency heating and cooling that Dandelion’s system provides will yield further cost reductions, she said.
And by eliminating the need for new gas pipelines and reducing the peak electricity demands on the power grid, subdivisions built on this model could save a bundle on utilities as well, she said. That’s a key benefit cited in a January report from the Department of Energy, which
That study also found ground-source heat pumps could make a big dent in residential energy consumption and carbon emissions, particularly in climates where they outperform air-source heat pumps during cold winter weather.
But as it stands, the technology is in no more than 1now in about 13.
The chief barrier, once again, is the up-front expense. Dandelion has spent the past eight years
To break into larger volume deployments, Dandelion has an investor in Dandelion that now owns about 10
## Colorado’s push for geothermal energy
Lennar and Dandelion aren’t disclosing cost data for the homes they’re collaborating on in Colorado. But, Hannun said, “
That’s certainly the case in Colorado, where Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, has made geothermal energy, or “
Over the past few years, the state has passed legislation creating 2021to launch a Clean Heat Plan that will provide significant rebates to projects that improve energy efficiency and help customers switch from gas to electric heating.
“
The government and utility incentives will also lower costs for people who aren’t buying these homes, because geothermal heat pump systems reduce the need for other utility infrastructure, he noted.
All-electric homes don’t need new gas pipeline extensions, the costs of which are typically recovered through increases on the bills of utility customers at large. And ground-source heat pumps need much less electricity than air-source heat pumps to keep homes warm during the coldest hours of the year, since they’re able to pull heat from deep underground thermal reservoirs rather than from cold outdoor air.
““
Power grids are sized to meet maximum electricity demand, so buildings that can reliably keep electricity use below certain limits minimize the need to build more grid infrastructure. These factors can make geothermal networks the least expensive option on a system-wide basis when the lifecycle costs of infrastructure and energy consumption are built in.
Xcel Energy is looking for ways to mitigate growing grid costs as it seeks
““
## Neighborhood geothermal energy options
Hannun isn’t aware of other homebuilders embedding ground-source heat pumps into large-scale single-family construction, though they are being built into bigger buildings, including multifamily housing.
But there are similar, yet distinct, approaches for single-family homes to tap underground temperature reserves to save energy and cut carbon emissions.
One is thermal energy networks — projects that build the infrastructure needed for geothermal heat pumps at a campus-wide or neighborhood scale instead of serving just one home. Utilities in Massachusetts and New York are actively pursuing these projects as part of their states’ decarbonization strategies. Six other states, including California and
““
Newly built neighborhoods can also incorporate thermal energy networks. A 7500
Under a “
Hannun agreed that shared thermal energy networks are an effective way to approach neighborhood-scale geothermal heating. But they’re also more complicated to build and administer than individual ground-source heat pumps, particularly for entities that aren’t a regulated utility with state-mandated authority to provide energy services to customers. Lennar and Dandelion opted for single-home ground loops to avoid any complications that could arise from getting lots of homeowners to commit to a shared system, she said.
Not all homebuilders will embrace the additional costs of ground-source geothermal, she said. Developers don’t pay utility bills, incentivizing them to choose the lowest-cost heating and cooling options available. At the same time, nationwide homebuilders like Lennar ““
It’s also a straightforward way to meet state or local energy-efficiency building codes, she added.
Air-source heat pumps are inherently more energy efficient than fossil-fueled furnaces, since they use energy to move heat from one place to another rather than to create heat directly. But ground-source heat pumps can be more than twice as efficient as air-source models.

The future of community solar is dimming, hampered by federal attacks on clean energy and shifts in state markets.
Installations of the shared-solar approach took a nosedive in the first half of 202536
Working in collaboration with the Coalition for Community Solar Access, an industry trade group, Wood Mackenzie forecasts that by the end of 202529202417122030

## Why community solar is buckling despite its benefits
Community solar makes clean power accessible to those who can’t put solar panels on their roofs — be it because they rent, can’t afford them, or have other reasons. Households can to a share of an off-site array, which is typically 220
About 9116GW2030
The megabill that Republicans passed in July is a major reason for the community solar market’s shake-up. The law set an early expiration date for a 3050203420262027
Because of the law’s passage, Wood Mackenzie slashed its community solar figures through 20308655
!Multicolored bar chart shows historical growth of community solar and projected overall decline through 2030. U.S. community solar growth in 2025 is set to decline by 29% from last year, according to a Wood Mackenzie forecast. (Wood Mackenzie)
But factors at the state level are also contributing to the slowdown. In particular, New York and Maine are driving the steep decline.
Developers in New York, a mature market, are having trouble finding sites, paying higher permitting and land costs, and having to wait an average of nearly three years to get connected to the grid, making projects more expensive to develop, Connelly said.
Meanwhile, in Maine, two regulatory changes are at play. Last year saw record growth as developers sprinted to get projects done by the December phaseout of the state’s net metering program, leading to fewer in the pipeline now, Connelly noted. In June, legislators also passed “pariah for investors.”
Some states, such as Virginia and New Mexico, also have caps on the size of their community solar programs that are limiting new developments, according to Connelly.
And more federal turbulence could be ahead.
The Trump administration is also trying to claw back funding that would’ve supported solar: the $7 and the $20, programs passed under the landmark Inflation Reduction Act.
“
While this year is likely to be a rough one for community solar, Connelly sees growth returning in 20262027
Massachusetts will open up its Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target program, SMART30150
But that growth is just a temporary reprieve. Over the longer term, the forecast shows community solar installations trending down.
## How to revive community solar growth
A few factors could change the sector’s fortunes, however.
For one, if states were to start new community solar programs, as well as address interconnection bottlenecks, they could drive up to 132030““
In deep red Montana, for example, legislators approved a new community solar program, with growing appeal to Republicans. But Gov. Greg Gianforte (R) vetoed the bill, claiming that it could result in “

Other states could be tempted to authorize a flood of clean, cheap solar power. The grid is data centers, electric vehicles, buildings, and manufacturing, and distributed community solar is among the fastest options to deploy.

California is facing a severe housing shortage. And in some places, namely Los Angeles, the need for new construction is even more dire because of recent wildfire destruction.
So in late June, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) prioritized faster construction over cleaner buildings with a law that pauses updates to state building codes for six years. It’ll also stop local jurisdictions from enacting their own stricter standards, Canary Media’s Alison F. Takemura reports. The move comes after LA

Another state will soon test the balance between affordable and clean construction, Alison reports. New York just approved an all-electric building code that bars gas and other fossil fuels in most new buildings. State officials estimate the new standards will end up raising construction costs, but the lowered energy bills they lead to should offset that increase within a decade.

Not only is the claim that dirty is faster and cheaper is a lie, it is the most insidiously evil lie. Reality is indeed quite the opposite. Dirty quickly creates deep debt. Killing debt. It is staggeringly inflationary. It is imprisoning. The kind of debt that rushes toward and guarantees extinction. The avoidance of debt is freedom, and life.

Once homes are very energy efficient, the heating requirements in most climate zones are quite small, and a heat pump can provide both heating and cooling all year around. A heat pump water heater can provide the hot water.
Once homes are this efficient, it's not cost effective to pay for a second energy distribution system, for natural gas. And heat pumps always beat propane and heating oil in any cost-effectiveness test.
The 2021 code in Washington State is cheaper that gas up to about 2,000 square feet in size, even in the service territory of the most expensive electric utility (Puget Sound Energy). Above that, gas had a bit of an edge. But gas prices have gone up faster than electricity prices, so even that balance point is changing quickly. And, in the lower-cost public power service territories, gas cannot compete at any building size.
Yes, there are parts of the country where supplemental heating is needed for the coldest days. I like my gas fireplace, and it could easily be a propane fireplace, adding 30,000 BTU of heat when needed, with no gas distribution utility required. It also provides me with a grid-independent source of heat, which has been great during power outages.
Once the avoided cost of a gas distribution system is factored in, an all-electric heat pump home will be the obvious economical choice except in the service territories of the highest-cost electric utilities -- the private utilities in California, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Pretty much everywhere else, all-electric heat pump, or all-electric heat pump with a propane fireplace, will be the economic choice for consumers.

Geothermal energy represents only about 04
Technological advances are making it possible to deploy geothermal in less obvious areas, breathing fresh life into the decades-old industry. In recent years, the carbon-free energy source has seen a surge of investment and bipartisan policy support amid soaring demand for electricity from data centers, factories, and electric vehicles.
Fervo and Sage, both based in Houston, have previously inked deals to supply the tech giants Google and Meta, respectively, with hundreds of megawatts of clean, around-the-clock power for their sprawling U.S. operations.
!A crane and under-construction facility in an open space in front of a mountain range Phase 1 of Fervo Energy's Cape Station project is well underway in Beaver County, Utah. (Fervo)
Next-generation geothermal also benefits from the fact that it shares the same workforce and supply chain as oil and gas companies, an industry now heavily favored in Washington, D.C. The sweeping budget law that President Donald Trump signed in July largely preserves key tax credits for geothermal power plants — despite slashing incentives for wind and solar — and the Trump administration is pushing to

## Fracking rocks to harness heat
Sage’s approach to geothermal energy involves tapping into both heat and pressure from hot, dry rocks found deep underground. To start, the company drills wells and fractures rocks to create artificial reservoirs that it pumps full of water. Sage cycles the water in and out of the fracture — like inflating and deflating a balloon — and can jettison the liquid to the surface to drive turbines and produce electricity.
The startup’s partnership with Reno, Nevada-based Ormat will allow Sage to access land and power-plant equipment and to connect to the grid far more quickly than if the startup set up a new site on its own. The companies are looking to install the next-generation system at a facility where Ormat’s older conventional wells are declining in capacity.
“ESG“
Terra Rogers of the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force said that Ormat’s decision to expand beyond its traditional hydrothermal resources and into next-generation tech represents “superhot rock geothermal program, called Ormat the “60190
As part of the agreement, Ormat can license Sage’s technologies for power generation as well as energy storage. The startup uses a similar setup to store excess grid energy. But instead of drilling deep into high-temperature rocks, Sage pumps water into shallower formations that aren’t as hot, since heat isn’t needed for storage. Pressure builds up underground and can be released later, when power demand spikes, to spin a pinwheel-like
““
Sage recently finished building its first commercial storage project on the site of a coal plant owned by San Miguel Electric Cooperative in Christine, Texas. The facility, which is expected to connect to the Texas grid in December, will be able to discharge 3MW

Chevron recently purchased a 2.5 square mile ranch property adjacent to the Geysers steam field in Sonoma County, CA. That's the largest output geothermal operation in the world. It's becoming clear that Trump's kneecapping of solar & offshore wind development is part of a premeditated plan by US BigOil&Gas to monopolize renewable energy resources, to the extent that's possible. They'll monopolize US offshore wind eventually, whenever they're ready. Meanwhile, they've ruled it off-limits for competitors.

If your power bills are getting higher and higher, you’re not alone. That’s probably little comfort, but here’s some proof anyway: Utilities requested or were granted a total of $292025
The biggest reason for these rising prices stems from the piece of the grid you can see from your window,
Natural disasters are also driving up expenses as they force utilities to repair and harden their grid for future weather events. California utilities, for instance, have to rebuild after wildfires and in some cases are spending even more money to underground lines. In the Southeast, utilities routinely look to raise rates to cover post-hurricane restoration costs.
Then there’s the fact that natural gas remains the U.S.’s dominant energy source and that prices for that fuel
Now for the second big question: Probably not, for a few reasons.
For starters, power demand is on the rise, stemming in large part from the construction of energy-hungry data centers. Tech giants plan to keep building facilities to run their AIhow they’re powered — and how that demand is managed — could end up making everyone else’s electricity more expensive.
That demand could be largely satiated by new solar and wind farms, which are typically wipe out federal tax credits that incentivized clean energy construction.
Instead, the Trump administration is pushing to keep aging fossil-fuel power plants online past their retirement dates — a mission that could end up costing utility customers as much as $6 by the end of President Donald Trump’s term. A federal order that kept a Michigan coal plant open past its planned closure cost its operator $29reupped the facility’s extension until November.

## Heat pumps boost winter EV

Gas cars move
Heat pumps are famous for their critical role in decarbonizing space heating in buildings. They don’t burn fossil fuel, and they’re typically two to three times as efficient as gas and electric-resistance systems, even below freezing. But the tech has also made its way into clothes dryers and water heaters. Now found in some EVs, heat pumps improve range by _

According to Recurrent’s 35
!Chart showing list of electric vehicles and winter range. Tesla Model X, which has a heat pump, preserves 89% range Electric vehicles with the best winter range tend to have heat pumps. (
It’s worth pointing out that heat pumps themselves are less effective as temperatures drop. Even so, EVs with heat pumps offer better range than those with electric-resistance heating. Recurrent points out that at 552033
!Chart of range loss percentage for heat pump heating and electric resistance heating Resistance heaters lead to more EV range loss (orange) than heat pumps do (purple), though the difference shrinks as it gets colder. (
To be clear, EVs work well in the winter even without heat pumps, Garberson said. His Rivian truck doesn’t have one, and on a day-to-day basis, he doesn’t even notice the decline in range. He charges at home, which makes topping up easy. For longer road trips, cold weather might mean he needs one more charging stop than he normally would.
## Strategies to maximize winter EV
Heating technology aside, drivers can take steps to get more out of their EVs in the cold. Recurrent’s Garberson offered his top three range-saving strategies for winter EV

The work is just the latest in a growing body of peer-reviewed research demonstrating that gas-burning stoves and other appliances harm not only future generations with their planet-warming emissions but also have direct health consequences for people who use them now. These appliances spew a wide range of pollutants, including deadly carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides linked to respiratory diseases.
Around the U.S., cities and states taking New York state is pursuing standards to ensure most new buildings will be all-electric. And in California, updates to infrastructure rules and a supportive statewide energy code are already tipping the economics toward all-electric construction.

The move comes as the United States turns away from its nascent efforts to develop a clean-hydrogen industry. The landmark 45 federal tax credits meant to spur production and use of clean hydrogen, once slated to last until 2033phase out in two years as a result of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The Trump administration, meanwhile, is poised to use funding meant for hydrogen-based steel projects to bolster production of steel made with fossil fuels instead.
China is already the world’s largest hydrogen market, by far. At about 331832
By contrast, “
Since a portion of that byproduct hydrogen is vented into the atmosphere as waste, the new national grants could include projects that capture and repurpose more of that gas. But China’s world-leading deployments of solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear power plants also generate an ample supply of clean electricity to produce green hydrogen — the version of the fuel made by blasting distilled water with enough electricity to separate hydrogen molecules from the oxygen ones. Already, in July, China agreed to sell a historic debut shipment of green steel made with hydrogen to buyers in Italy.
Despite China’s clean-energy advantage, the U.S. and European Union had, until now, boasted stronger national policies for developing domestic green hydrogen.
While China’s government-owned businesses invested in green hydrogen, “45 tax credits in America’s Inflation Reduction Act or the European hydrogen bank, said Anne-Sophie Corbeau, a hydrogen researcher at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.

Corbeau said the conditions are already there for China to dominate the industry. Once the federal tax credits expire, she said, ““
She noted that in Europe earlier this year, the regional hydrogen bank’s second offering of a public subsidy for hydrogen tried to limit funding for projects that had too many Chinese components. But “

Senate Republicans released a
In May, House Republicans voted to slash all the clean power credits, with some favorable treatment for nuclear plants. The Senate took a more nuanced approach, doing away with credits for cheap but intermittent resources, while continuing to incentivize projects that can generate power on demand.
The Senate version would crank down investment and production tax credits for wind and solar power starting in 202620282033meteoric growth streak going.
This effort to continue supporting “AI and domestic manufacturing (two avowed priorities of the Trump administration), not to mention the widespread electrification needed to address climate change.
The problem is, nuclear construction has stagnated since the woefully delayed and over-budget Vogtle expansion; hydropower has been essentially frozen for decades; and geothermal is just starting to gain traction thanks to a handful of startups developing new technologies.
Of the Senate’s chosen few, batteries are the only contender showing real dynamism in energy markets: In just a few years, they’ve jumped from the margins to become the second-biggest source of new power capacity added to the U.S. grid each year, after solar. Energy storage dominates the queues of projects waiting to hook up to the grid in the next few years in places like California and Texas.
The Senate still needs to debate this proposal and see if it rallies enough votes to pass. Then the Senate and House will have to reconcile their differences. There’s no way to know if the current Senate language will become the law of the land.
Nonetheless, this proposal changes the political landscape for clean energy advocates, by splitting clean energy into winners and losers. It also tacks on requirements around foreign influence that seem conceptually more workable than the House’s “, but that could still thwart actual construction.
## Splitting storage from solar and wind
The idea of excluding wind and solar from receiving credits has been percolating over the last few months, though it was easy to miss in a generally turbulent news cycle. In April, U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, a Republican from North Dakota, introduced a bill that she dubbed the “
““
The legislation didn’t get much attention at the time, and Fedorchak’s House colleagues yanked support from several of the dispatchable options anyway. But she had some historical facts on her side: Wind and solar have enjoyed federal tax structures since the George W. Bush era (incentives for wind actually go back further), when they emerged as a 2023
On June 3
“Form Energy and Hydrostor, along with geothermal, nuclear, and hydro firms. “
They never said to throw wind and solar under the bus, but emphasized the particular value in keeping credits for dispatchable resources as senators decided where to cut spending.
## Will new rules on China scuttle battery financing anyway?
The House, besides greatly shrinking the timeline for clean energy tax credits, tacked on new requirements that industry insiders decried as impossible to fulfill. The language would block incentives for projects that include any components from a “
The Senate shares the concern about tax credits accruing to Chinese companies, but handled it differently. In its version, the company filing for tax credits cannot be literally or effectively controlled by prohibited foreign entities — that’s a test that U.S.-based developers should, in theory, have no trouble passing. But the text gets very specific on what kinds of arrangements could constitute “
Additionally, developers must spend a certain amount of the total project cost on products that are not from “402026
Of course, tax credit compliance is the province of well-paid lawyers, who would need to translate the details of the Senate language into actionable legal guidance for companies. The clean energy industry is still reeling from yearslong rulemakings at the Internal Revenue Service that held back many of the investments championed by the Biden administration. Today, the Trump administration has winnowed civil service staff and actively opposed clean energy; it’s hard to imagine IRS
Storage developers are frantically running the numbers on whether their power plant designs can stay within the guidelines for foreign components, so that they’ll qualify for the tax credits. They also need their financiers to feel confident that they will. Highly prescriptive legislative interference in a high-tech business landscape complicates that process, and could cause investors to pull back until the dust clears.
That’s not to say battery construction will come to a halt without workable incentives. It’s arguably the only dispatchable technology that can be built quickly in the next few years. But saddling the credits with additional bureaucratic requirements would inject extra costs and delays into the industry, at a time when the U.S. desperately needs all the on-demand power it can get.

Utilidata and Nvidia’s projects with Portland General Electric, Duquesne Light, and other utility partners aren’t going to completely replace those utilities’ existing smart meters — at least, not right away. Instead, these initial projects are tied to strategic deployments at parts of the grid where the utilities are seeking more granular information, Brumberger said.

These virtual power plants (VPPs) or distributed energy resource management systems (DERMS can sometimes be handled in a command-and-control fashion by utility grid operations centers communicating to in-field devices via hard-wired, cellular, or broadband internet.

I love this article because grid edge AI can Integrate a residence with an EV, solar PV, a home battery, home electrical equipment, a smart power meter and the local grid. This will improve stability and speed without the need for gas peaker plants. A vehicle to grid (V2G) solution could be integrated into the grid faster if smart microinverters and AI are part of the system rather than a grid disconnect switch during a blackout.

A sprawling budget bill working its way through the New Hampshire legislature includes under-the-radar provisions that could gut an important state renewable energy program.
The
Advocates say the changes would endanger renewable energy development in New Hampshire and do not belong in this bill, which is intended to lay out policy changes needed to implement the state budget.
““
Supporters of the measures, however, say they are sensible approaches to saving consumers money at a time when energy bills have been soaring.
““
The provisions in question relate to the state’s Renewable Energy Fund, which utilities pay into when they are unable to meet state requirements for procuring renewable energy. The fund supports programs including competitive grants for non-residential renewable energy projects, rebates for solar installations, and funding for community solar projects benefiting low- to moderate-income residents.
The pending bill would transfer all of the fund’s uncommitted dollars to the general fund, as the state deals with ongoing budget shortfalls. Then, from 20276600002024
“
The fund’s annual revenue has ranged from less than $1419200720235945140000400000
Projects like these would be at risk if the proposal to return renewable energy fund money to utility customers becomes a reality, Krakoff said. “
Vose acknowledged that the plan for the fund would deprive some proposed projects of access to money, but said tackling high energy bills is more important right now. In addition, the renewable energy market has developed to a point at which it might not need as much support from state incentives anymore, he said.
““
The bill is now under consideration in the Senate. Supporters and opponents alike expect the Senate to remove the provision that funnels money out of the renewable energy fund, though that does not mean it will be completely off the table. It is possible the measure could be restored when the two chambers conference to resolve the differences in their versions of the bill, Vose said.
Otherwise, it is probable the idea will return as a standalone bill at the beginning of next year, he said. It would likely be joined by another measure adjusting some of the requirements for renewable energy procurement by utilities and lowering the payments they make into the fund for noncompliance.
That, said Paul, is where these ideas belong: In their own bills, facing public scrutiny, rather than deep within a budget implementation bill.

!A solar system at Abrams Hall, an affordable housing building in Washington D.C., installed by Flywheel Development.

The Trump administration is making it harder for low-income households to access the money-saving benefits of solar — but hard doesn’t mean impossible.
There’s a lot for developers of affordable solar projects to navigate at the moment.
The Trump administration has clawed back billions of dollars in Inflation Reduction Act funding for projects serving low-income communities across the country, including $7“. In July, the GOP-controlled Congress passed a sweeping law that will swiftly phase out the tax credits solar developers use to bring down costs. And for months now, the administration has held up $20 in federal green bank funding, which some organizations planned to use to make solar available to more people.
Clean energy supporters are opposing the Trump administration’s freeze on green bank money in court and are expected to challenge the Solar For All clawback as well. In the meantime, the nonprofits and state agencies planning affordable solar projects with the money are left in limbo.
Still, some developers are forging ahead.
Take John Miller and Jessica Pitts as an example. The pair, which founded 201435175
Figuring out a way to continue this work is crucial as energy costs rise even faster under Trump.
Rooftop solar is an effective way for households to reduce their electricity bills. But for a number of reasons, many low-income households can’t install rooftop solar: They may not own their home, or if they do, the up-front costs might be too high or they could struggle to qualify for a loan. Meanwhile, solar power is a tough sell for most multifamily housing, particularly rental properties where landlords take on the cost of installing panels that primarily benefit tenants, who usually pay the lion’s share of utility bills.
Community solar projects like those developed by Flywheel and others can solve these problems. Low-income households are able to sign up to access energy from these shared installations, letting them tap into the benefits of the clean energy resource.
In places where community solar isn’t available, multifamily properties can still use on-site arrays to reduce their utility bills. Those savings can be used to invest in cost-of-living upgrades, as can lease payments paid to properties that are hosting solar systems.
## How Trump has scrambled affordable solar economics
Federal action may not have completely foreclosed affordable solar aspirations — but in many cases, it has narrowed what’s possible.
“
Enterprise has deployed 76MW
Enterprise had hoped to deploy 242032“
And although Flywheel is pushing ahead with its full project pipeline, the financial calculus has gotten tougher due to Trump’s policy changes. The tax-credit phaseout “
While the new law doesn’t immediately eliminate the federal tax credits that cover 30require projects to start construction by July 20262027complex and still-vague anti-China rules starting next year.
These policy headwinds are raising costs and cutting into the utility bill savings that developers can pass on to low-income residents, Fox said. Enterprise has historically offered average savings between 205020“50
Flywheel earns a fairly good return on its investments, if not as lucrative as those possible from higher-end real estate projects, Pitts said. The company evenly splits its revenues with host properties for some of its projects, and accepts 30
Losing federal tax credits will make solar projects more expensive, which will require lenders to adjust their expectations, but Pitts said she thinks their more community-focused financing partners, like the DC
“
## Keeping the affordable solar work going
A large part of why Flywheel can press on with its plans is its partnership with the local government.
Much of its work has been backed by payments from D.C.’s 6288
Finding lenders for these relatively novel solar projects was tough at first, said Miller. The company has primarily worked with CDFIs, which focus on underserved communities.
It also found a crucial partner in the DCgrowing number of “ that make clean energy, efficiency, and environmental remediation loans in communities that have been shunned by mainstream lenders. Flywheel’s Fairfax Village project received one of the DC
The results speak for themselves. Flywheel’s D.C.-backed projects at properties like the 154
They’ve also provided $425
Flywheel is helping property owners put some of those proceeds toward energy-efficiency upgrades, Pitts said, which would slash utility bills even further.
At the Perrington Condominiums property in D.C., for example, Flywheel combined solar photovoltaic panels that meet about half the building’s annual electricity needs with rooftop solar thermal systems to offset about 40
Enterprise is encouraging its buildings to do something similar. The nonprofit is working on long-term solar power purchase agreements to hedge against rising utility rates in the region. “
Any savings Enterprise can achieve through solar PPAs can be put toward energy-efficiency investments. ““30
Plowing energy savings back into properties is key to increasing the financial attractiveness of low-income solar projects to conventional lenders, said Sadie McKeown, president of Community Preservation Corp., a CDFICPC23000024

Driving down the cost of borrowing to pay for these kinds of sustainability investments is a critical step in reducing the need for incentives or subsidies to make them pencil out financially, she said.

It’s frustrating to see clean energy programs for low-income households undermined at the federal level. Community solar projects have proven time and again that they can bridge the gap for families who don’t have the resources to install rooftop panels themselves. Developers like Flywheel pressing forward despite the setbacks show just how important resilience is in this fight. Local governments, nonprofits, and private partners will need to step up to offset these federal rollbacks. The long-term Geometry Dash Lite benefits — lower utility bills, cleaner air, and healthier communities — are too important to let slip away.

The House Ways and Means budget proposal would gut the Inflation Reduction Act and slow the rollout of solar, wind, and storage. It’d crimp EVcrush clean-energy manufacturing. Energy costs and carbon emissions would rise. Green hydrogen would remain forever a whisper in the wind, even after so much screaming about the arcane rules governing its incentives.
But it’d also derail two Republican hobbyhorses: nuclear power and advanced geothermal.
The proposal introduced Monday is “told Canary Media’s Jeff St. John.

Other recent moves by Republicans and the Trump administration could create additional headwinds for nuclear. That includes the backed the only U.S. nuclear reactors to come online this century as well as a more recent effort to revive a shuttered Michigan nuclear plant.
All of this is difficult to square with Trump’s broad proclamations that he will unleash American energy dominance. It’s even harder to reconcile with Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s specific call for a “
But then, the prevailing principle of this Trump administration has not been tidy logic. Instead, it appears to be volatility and chaos — and this proposal from Congress certainly furthers that tradition.

Geothermal energy was spared in President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax and spending law, which made deep cuts to incentives for other forms of clean energy. But developers of the resurgent energy source may still face difficulties ahead due to complex stipulations folded into the new law, among other Trump administration policies.
The “sharply curtailed, and subsidies for residential clean energy projects will abruptly end after this year.
Geothermal advocates celebrated the outcome for their industry, which they say will be vital to scaling the resource in the United States to meet the nation’s soaring power demand. The sector has attracted a lot of attention in recent years because it can provide carbon-free power around the clock — something solar and wind can’t do — and technological advances are making it possible to deploy geothermal in places that conventional plants can’t go.

Still, the industry isn’t immune to the broader market challenges created by Trump’s policies, despite its more favorable treatment from Congress.

In June, the startup XGS150 next-generation geothermal project in New Mexico by 2030signed a similar agreement last year with Sage Geosystems to build 150MW2027
Geothermal has long drawn bipartisan support and has so far dodged Trump’s broader attacks on renewable energy. It helps that the new geothermal wave has considerable overlap with the oil and gas industry, sharing the same drilling equipment, workforce, and investors.

For next-generation geothermal firms, the tax incentives are crucial to getting the first slate of projects up and running. Developers use the promise of future tax credits as collateral to raise the many millions in financing they need to explore suitable project sites and deploy novel drilling technologies. The credits also help to attract major customers, including tech giants that are looking for a variety of baseload power sources to run their sprawling data centers.

A federal effort meant to boost domestic manufacturing of low-carbon construction materials abruptly ended this week after the Trump administration moved to unravel a wide array of U.S. climate policies.
On Monday, President Donald Trump
Trump’s action marks a significant setback for the emerging policy approach. Proponents say Buy Clean programs can play a crucial role in curbing planet-warming pollution from heavy industrial sectors — both by disincentivizing dirty operations and by spurring public and private investment in cutting-edge domestic factories.
“
The federal initiative also aimed to unify and build upon the patchwork of Buy Clean programs underway in a handful of states — including California, Colorado, and Washington — and to boost existing efforts by industry groups to compile and share emissions data. Many of these initiatives are expected to continue in the years ahead, though it’s unclear how quickly and deeply they can transform industries on their own.
““
One particular initiative that launched under Biden, the Federal-State Buy Clean Partnership, 13
The U.S. industrial sector accounts for about significant sources of toxic air pollution in the communities where they operate.
America’s earliest Buy Clean efforts began about a decade ago in California as a way to boost business for local steel producers, which were losing out on state contracts to Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper but more emissions-intensive metal. Today, the broader Buy Clean concept has evolved to include prioritizing materials made not just from cleaner conventional facilities but also from next-generation projects — including potentially steel mills fueled by green hydrogen or cement plants that use coral-inspired processes to curb CO2.
The federal Buy Clean strategy officially launched in December 2021“452022IRA
About half of that pie went to help the General Services Administration procure low-carbon building materials for construction and renovation projects. As part of the work, the independent agency — often dubbed the government’s landlord — “

In a related effort, the Environmental Protection Agency last year IRACO2 emissions associated with extracting, transporting, and manufacturing individual products. Just last month, the Federal Highway Administration granted another $12 to support 39
Much of that IRA14057“““
Kwon said he’s less concerned about what happens to the federal funding than he is about losing three years’ worth of progress on developing expertise, publishing data, and establishing relationships among government workers, contractors, and manufacturers. The White House website has taken down many announcements and resources related to Buy Clean. It’s unclear whether national databases on emissions inventories and product declarations will remain online and accessible, though the U.S. Climate Alliance said it will house and sustain work related to the federal-state partnership
““
Rescinding Buy Clean also adds uncertainty for the slate of new U.S. facilities that received federal funding to demonstrate novel, lower-carbon manufacturing methods. Under Biden, for example, 15
8720272028
Joe Hicken, Sublime’s vice president of business development and policy, said that reducing public procurement policies like Buy Clean “““
For U.S. steel producers, such market competition could push the industry to address emissions from existing and future facilities, even in the absence of a federal Buy Clean policy.
The CO2 emissions associated with making the essential metal. That’s because private-sector buyers like global automakers and architectural groups are increasingly looking to source materials with lower embodied emissions, said Kevin Dempsey, the institute’s president and CEO
““
Dempsey added that Buy Clean is just one tool for advancing lower-emissions industrial products. Another approach — one that could gain more traction under the tariff-friendly Trump administration — could be to adopt trade policies that penalize imports of steel made in highly polluting overseas facilities. Making cleaner domestic steel “
And while the federal Buy Clean strategy was pivotal, Williams of the Center for American Progress said he expects that state agencies will keep broadening their own Buy Clean strategies to curb industrial pollution within their jurisdictions. On the Pacific Coast, the states of California, Washington, and Oregon are working together to boost the use and production of low-carbon materials

Dear Maria, thank you for picking up these topics and sharing with a broader audience. Cleaning up and changing the construction industry is not a four years process. Whether it's low carbon footprint cement or steel, the worldwide industry is going through a massive change to take advantage of 21st century technologies. Ultrahigh Performance Concrete is another example to reduce the carbon footprint today by allowing to build lighter, faster and more durable. China and India taking the lead and use UHPC to upgrade their infrastructure and limit the percentage of funds going into repair in the future. We must break the existing ""lowest upfront cost and highest maintenance cost"" decision making cycle that limits the acceptance of advanced lower carbon footprint construction materials. Peter

Eavor's closed-loop geothermal system in Germany is expected to produce 8.2 megawatts of electricity and 64 MW of district heating when fully completed. (Eavor)
On Tuesday, the Canadian company released results from two years of drilling activity at its flagship operation in Geretsried, Germany, giving Canary Media an exclusive early look. Eavor said the data validates its initial efforts to deploy novel “
“
Eavor is part of a fast-growing effort to expand geothermal energy projects beyond traditional hot spots like California’s Salton Sea region or Iceland’s lava fields. The company and other firms — including Fervo Energy, Sage Geosystems, and XGS — are adapting tools and techniques from the oil and gas industry to be able to withstand the harsh conditions found deep underground.
The industry wants to produce abundant amounts of clean electricity and heat virtually anywhere in the world, and it could serve as an ideal, around-the-clock pairing to solar and wind power. But geothermal companies are only just starting to put their novel technologies to the test.
Eavor began drilling in Geretsried in July 2023“2818

Operations on the first of four loops are nearly complete, and the startup plans begin construction on its second loop in March 20268264MW
In its new paper, Eavor said it encountered significant challenges in drilling its first eight of twelve lateral wells, which took over 10010000050
For example, Eavor said it successfully deployed an insulated drill pipe technology, which can actively cool drilling tools even as they encounter increasingly hotter conditions underground and helps to increase drilling speed. The adjustments also enabled Eavor to triple the length of time its drill bit could run before wearing out, further reducing downtime during the operation.
On top of cutting drilling time and costs, these improvements should also pave a path to boosting Eavor’s thermal-energy output per loop by about 35
The Germany project will be the first commercial system of its kind when it starts producing power later this year. But other next-generation approaches — like the enhanced geothermal systems that Fervo is building in Utah and operating in Nevada — are also scaling up.
Enhanced geothermal involves fracturing rocks and pumping down liquids to create artificial reservoirs. The hot rocks directly heat the liquids, which return to the surface to make steam. This approach is relatively more efficient at extracting heat from the ground, but it can also raise the risk of inducing earthquakes or affecting groundwater — though experts say that’s unlikely to happen in well-managed projects. In places that ban fracking, like Germany, closed-loop systems can still move forward.
But the closed-loop design has trade-offs of its own, said Jeff Tester, a professor of sustainable energy systems at Cornell University and the principal scientist for Cornell’s Earth Source Heat project. Namely, the pipes can limit the transfer of heat from the underground rocks to the fluids inside the pipe, which in turn limits how much energy a system can produce.

Vany said that Eavor’s modeling shows its technology is already in line with the “50100

Advocates involved with the analysis are clear-eyed about these roadblocks for passenger EVs. But they also say there is cause for guarded hope — starting with consumer behavior.

The deployment of EVs aligns with the self-interest of the investor-owned monopoly utilities that dominate the region: Electric vehicles can both increase their sales and provide other benefits to the grid. For instance, plug-in cars and buses can act as batteries, storing power that can be discharged during times of high demand. Outlays by Southeastern utilities experimenting with these uses have lagged behind those in the rest of the country — representing just 766
Perhaps more than any other player, the automakers themselves will make the biggest difference in how EV
One decision automakers face is on the front end: Do they retreat from, or double down on, the investments they’ve already made in battery and electric vehicle production? The report notes that companies have already canceled plans for seven facilities in the region, worth a total of $35

That trend could persist since Congress spared incentives for battery manufacturing from devastating cuts in this summer’s budget law.

When ecologist Anthony Bicknell went looking for fish around the foundations of wind turbines a dozen or so miles off the coast of Scotland in the North Sea, he wasn’t sure what he’d find.
But he was ready for something surprising. Around that time, some European lobsters were catching researchers off guard by taking up residence in wind turbine foundations in the waters off of the British Isles. Sure enough, Bicknell and his team counted two more sea creatures that scientists had never documented congregating around wind turbines: a flatfish known as a dab and, most strikingly, haddock.
Haddock is one of Scotland’s highest-value commercial fish, ranking above cod and just below herring in total number of fish caught annually. Unlike cod, haddock don’t usually hang out around shipwrecks and other human-made structures on the seafloor.
The discovery that these sleek silvery fish are utilizing wind foundations, described in
Offshore wind is growing rapidly in some parts of the world, particularly in northern Europe and China, as nations look to complement other carbon-free resources like solar.
In the U.S., the industry has faced opposition from the fishing industry, environmentalists, and other anti-wind groups who have raised concerns about how turbines will affect marine life. False claims about offshore wind’s impact on ocean animals — especially whales — have been spread by opponents including President Donald Trump, who issued an executive order on his first day in office that has slowed the industry to a crawl.
The new study from Bicknell, a senior research fellow at the University of Exeter, is the latest in a growing body of research that suggests offshore wind turbines, like other hard structures introduced to the seabed, can not only coexist with marine life but potentially benefit certain species.
Scientists have repeatedly found, for example, that an oil rig or oil platform can become an oasis of hard structure in ocean expanses devoid of much else but sand. They attract barnacles, shellfish, invertebrates, and, eventually, the fish that like to eat those creatures. An entire food web can grow.
Studies like Bicknell’s find the same phenomenon is playing out around some wind turbines installed on the seafloor of the North Sea. Except, unlike oil rigs, these massive pieces of infrastructure are helping to reduce the carbon emissions caused by burning fossil fuels, which is rapidly warming the ocean and devastating marine life worldwide.
Bicknell and his coauthors discovered that the older the wind foundation, the more fish — and sometimes bigger fish — like to call it home. This is true, they found, for many demersal fish like flatfish, haddock, and cod, which sit lower on the food chain. His team focused on the U.K. offshore wind farms known as Beatrice and Moray East; some of the studied turbines were built in 20172020
These studies also underscore that offshore wind farms are clearly changing the ocean. Scientists are still debating which species are most feeling the change.
“
Take the case of the European lobsters that like to turn wind foundations into homes. In 2021
For haddock, the turbines are more like a buffet. Bicknell described the fish as enjoying what he and other scientists call “
Some of these discoveries are helping researchers in the U.S., where offshore wind has been slow to catch on. Five projects are actively under construction in the country, but only one commercial-scale offshore wind project, South Fork Wind, is in operation today. Meanwhile, the U.K. has over 4015GW

During construction, wind farms could have negative effects on fish, said Runde.
Artificial noise, changes to seafloor sediment, and newly laid cables that emit electromagnetic fields can all impact fish in the short-term. However, his team’s research has found that the Atlantic sturgeon, an endangered species, and a variety of sharks are not avoiding the area even during ongoing construction.
At least 78 off the coast of Virginia, according to Dominion, while new ones continue to be built in spite of federal headwinds from Trump. In Virginia, offshore wind has a history of bipartisan support, and Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, is a vocal supporter of Dominion’s 26176
Runde’s research is ongoing and must now endure a challenging political moment for the offshore wind sector. In addition to calling wind farms “gutted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of staff and resources in recent months. Runde actively collaborates with NOAANOAA
When it comes to measuring the long-term benefits of these structures, Runde and his team use some of the same methods as their British counterparts: baited remote underwater video, which measures fish abundance, size, and diversity at the pilot turbines. The foundations they explore can reach depths of 120
Black sea bass are already making homes out of these foundations. Runde said that one fish that was tagged at a Virginia wind foundation in February 2024

“
“
It was an unlikely sight. America’s fishermen have long treated wind developers as their sworn enemies.
The conflict started in the early 2000
Few of these predictions have come to pass in places like the U.K., which has already built over 50habitat for haddock. But even today, fisher-led groups in the U.S. are spearheading lawsuits aiming to halt at least two offshore wind farms under construction on the East Coast. One former offshore wind executive told Canary Media that the amount of pushback from fishermen in America has made offshore wind investments riskier than in Europe.
Yerman was one of the first fishermen in the U.S. to cross this bitter divide. He’s become the reluctant face of a group of over 100
Pursuing work in wind power has come at a cost. After the awards event, back in blue jeans and with a celebratory beer in hand, Yerman recounted the exact word New England fishermen used when he and his crew first crossed the Rubicon.
“
Those tensions have become supercharged with the election of President Donald Trump, who has called offshore wind “““
Yerman and his crew are left wondering if the industry they’ve bet their livelihood on — and work they’ve risked their reputations for — will all come crashing down.
Many of the fishermen who work through Sea Services voted for Trump. And if the president fulfills his promise to halt the industry, it would be devastating not only for the Northeast’s climate goals and grid reliability — but for thousands of workers in the region, from electricians to welders to Sea Services’ fishermen.
One of Sea Services’ captains, Kevin Souza, put it simply: The impact would be “
## **“**
Six years ago, Yerman was like the others — angry with offshore wind developers, particularly Danish giant Ørsted, which had set up shop in his hometown of New London, Connecticut.
Concerned that wind turbines might push his son out of the scalloping business, he pulled one of the only levers he could think to pull and contacted his state senator at the time, Paul Formica, a Republican who owned a local seafood restaurant.
Formica wanted to see the two sides get along. He arranged a meeting between Yerman and an Ørsted executive named Matthew Morrissey, who happened to be a native of New Bedford, Massachusetts, the most lucrative commercial fishing port in America.
![]( Offshore wind turbine blades sit in the staging area of the recently modernized Marine Commerce Terminal in New Bedford, Massachusetts, awaiting deployment in one of three offshore wind projects being actively built off the coast in spring 2025. (Clare Fieseler/Canary Media)
Yerman found in Morrissey a sympathetic ear, and in turn, he listened to what the executive had to say — that Ørsted was open to partnering with fishermen. Morrissey had seen, with his own eyes, fishers working for and coexisting with Ørsted in a tiny port in Kilkeel, Northern Ireland. The energy firm had a team of about two dozen marine affairs employees, Morrissey relayed, who could help make something like that happen in America if Yerman was on board. He pitched it as a win-win.
““
The idea intrigued Yerman. In the U.S., profits from scalloping have fluctuated from year to year, and, following a crash in the 1990
Yerman got to work.
His first call was to Gordon Videll, a longtime friend and affable small-town lawyer, who knew things about contracts that Yerman didn’t. The two flew to Kilkeel — on their own dime — to see the model for themselves. Videll noticed that some of Kilkeel’s fishermen were driving cars nicer than his. He and Yerman were inspired.
When they returned to Connecticut, Yerman recruited about a half dozen of his commercial fishing buddies, and Videll started putting together the paperwork. They dubbed themselves Sea Services North America and in 2021
““
Today, Sea Services operates like a co-op and has brought 22CEO11
It’s important work: making sure, for example, no fishing gear, like crab traps, is in the way of cables, monopiles, or survey operations. If necessary, Sea Services fishermen move gear — with the owner’s approval. When not cleared, these obstacles have caused days and sometimes weeks of costly delays for developers, according to Morrissey.
Sea Services was an “which went online last year and became America’s first large-scale offshore wind project, wrote Ed LeBlanc, a current Ørsted executive, in an email to Canary Media. The firm has since contracted the group for other projects, in no small part because of their expertise about local waters, he added.

Receiving the Oceantic Network award in late April was a big deal for the collective, said Videll. It’s an example of how successful the venture has been in a short period of time — and, more importantly, it should be good for business. Industry awards mean visibility. More visibility could mean more Sea Services contracts.

But, right now, the Sea Services business faces headwinds that no award can help overcome.
Since taking office in January, President Trump has launched an all-out assault on the offshore wind industry. On his first day in office, he halted new lease and permitting activity and called for a review of the nine projects that already had their federal permits in hand. In March, his Environmental Protection Agency chief revoked a key permit for Atlantic Shores, a fully permitted project that
The most eyebrow-raising step came in April, when Trump’s Interior Department issued a stop-work order for Empire Wind 1had begun at-sea construction.
It was a wake-up call for Sea Services, which works for Norwegian energy giant Equinor on the project. Videll, Sea Services’ CEO912
In May, the administration suddenly lifted the stop-work order. Sea Services’ contract was safe, at least for the time being. But it was the most bracing illustration yet that the business, in spite of all its success, now faces very choppy waters under the Trump administration.

The hardest part of Yerman’s job is overcoming this cultural aversion and getting fishermen to the table, convincing them that working for the offshore wind developers is a way to sustain a livelihood whose viability has begun to fade.

The lobstermen have a point regarding Trump. As frustrating as their remarks may be, the biggest threat to offshore wind is not snipes from colleagues, but the actions of a president who many Sea Services members — including Souza — voted for.

A fast-growing startup is giving Texas homeowners cheap access to unusually large batteries for backup power — and paying for it by maneuvering those same batteries in the state’s ERCOT

To make good on that promise, the 80
““
If a homeowner in Texas wants backup power, they could buy solar and a battery. But most battery products aren’t large enough to meet the needs of the typical American home — that’s why you see three Tesla Powerwalls lined up in some garages. At that point, the out-of-pocket cost reaches tens of thousands of dollars, unless the buyer grapples with the current state of interest rates and takes out a loan.
Base Power pitches the benefits of whole-home backup power without the massive up-front expenditure. The company designed its own battery for the express purpose of backup power, so each unit packs 251015114
But the customers don’t buy this product: They pay a $4951685
If there’s no such thing as a free lunch, nor is there nearly free backup power. Base Power (and, by extension, its venture backers) fronts this rather hefty bill, on the premise that it can make money not just from customer subscriptions but by bidding the decentralized battery fleet into the ERCOT

In that sense, this company is the newest in a lineage of startups seeking to unlock the multi-layered benefits of distributed energy devices, which both help a local customer and, when harnessed with effective software and amenable market rules, make the overall grid more clean and efficient.
Many startups have gone bankrupt chasing this rosy vision. Base Power aims to avoid their fate by adopting a very old technique in the utility sector: vertical integration.
## Vertical integration for home batteries
In order to make its customer-friendly product into a viable business, Dell and company have taken control of every step of their value chain, rather than outsourcing or partnering.
The company designed its own battery hardware, giving it far more capacity than the market-leading home battery systems. Base Power wrote its own software to govern the batteries and operate them as a decentralized fleet bidding into the wholesale markets. And the startup does its own sales, installations, and long-term maintenance.
The corporate strategy, Dell explained, is to create “

Minimizing cost and reliance on outside parties makes fundamental sense, and yet fledgling startups typically shy away from taking on so much for fear of biting off more than they can chew.

It’s a business strategy that calls to mind the
## Growing ecosystem of home-battery aggregators
The do-it-all approach also distinguishes Base Power from others that are similarly trying to get more batteries into people’s homes.
German company Sonnen launched a no-money-down battery offering in Texas with a company called 1000
Neither sonnen nor Solrite are retail electricity providers in Texas, though, so they need to pair up with companies that buy and sell power and can monetize the batteries’ ability to arbitrage. The Solrite deal requires people to sign up for 25500
Other climatetech-savvy retailers offer special deals for people who buy their own batteries. Great Britain’s Octopus Energy has entered the ERCOT and offers
Startup David Energy offers retail plans in which the company 400
Those providers still need customers to front the money or take out a loan to install their own batteries, which constrains how quickly battery adoption can grow. On the other hand, that model means those companies can focus on honing their energy software and trading strategy and don’t have to spend millions of dollars to install and own batteries that might one day pay for themselves.
Base Power pays for its buildout with a mix of equity, debt, and tax credits, Dell noted. Investors funded an $860ERCOT

Rooftop solar costs way more in the United States than it does elsewhere in the world. That’s long been a headache for the sector to navigate. But now with Republicans in Congress killing off the decades-old tax credit for rooftop solar, it’s a life-or-death problem.
So says Andrew Birch, a 25“
Some of those factors are under a solar company’s control, like how much it spends on acquiring customers and managing projects. Others aren’t, like the expense associated with navigating complex permitting and interconnection processes that differ from city to city and from utility to utility.
Those costs rise when solar systems are accompanied by batteries, something that is becoming increasingly common as households look for backup power and respond to new incentive structures that prioritize storage, as is the case in California, the nation’s largest rooftop solar market.
Big upfront costs are the GOP30
In order for the U.S. to keep installing rooftop solar at a healthy rate — something that’s key to combatting climate change and helping people manage rising electricity costs and electrify their cars and homes — the industry needs to figure out how to prevent costs from ballooning once the incentives disappear.

Birch, a native Australian known as “
He helped launch “used by more than 160 across the U.S. to process solar permits in hours rather than weeks.
There’s plenty of evidence that lowering these costs is possible: The soft-cost problem is a bit of a uniquely American phenomenon. In other places with high rooftop solar penetration, like Australia, the

## Streamlining permitting at cities and counties
When it comes to cutting soft costs, local permitting reform is a big target.
Permitting regulations and processes vary widely across the roughly 23000SEIA
Some do a good job of making the process smooth and straightforward. Others can be far less helpful and efficient. Slow or cumbersome permitting takes a toll on solar installers, stretching the time it takes to complete current projects and move on to the next.
“CEO“‘‘
It’s hard to standardize permitting across local authorities, which range from well-staffed big-city departments to tiny towns with one or two people working on it. But software that can reliably complete the tasks of permitting officials can save time and reduce errors for big and small permitting authorities alike.
In 2018SEIA2020dramatically sped up permitting without sacrificing quality, the platform was made available at large.
Automated permitting turns multiple back-and-forth processes into a “similar automated platforms from startups and from city permitting departments are now providing similar same-day options.
The advantages of instant permitting are so great, Cinnamon said, that he’s stopped doing projects in cities and counties that don’t offer some form of it. With less than six months to finish projects that can secure tax credits, “
The next step is to expand instant permitting from hundreds to thousands of cities and counties by taking on statewide permitting reforms, said Nick Josefowitz, CEO
Over the past several years, states including Democratic strongholds like
Reform looks different in every state. California set mandates for cities and counties to use instant permitting, while Texas and Florida required cities and counties to allow licensed and credentialed third parties to issue permits and conduct inspections on homeowners’ behalf. Colorado’s law backed off on mandates but offered incentives for local authorities to deploy instant permitting, while New Jersey’s law would empower a state agency to set up instant permitting for cities and counties to use.
Lowering permitting costs can allow solar installers to cut their prices, which increases their business, spurs more competition, and gives households more options, Josefowitz said. A series of studies this year from Brown University’s Climate Solutions Lab and the Greenhouse Institute found that streamlined and instant permitting in 22030100
The results are good not just for households and solar installers but for cash-strapped municipalities, said Elowyn Corby, mid-Atlantic regional director for nonprofit group Vote Solar, which advocated for New Jersey’s newly passed reform bill.

## Streamlining utility interconnection processes
Permits aren’t the only solar roadblocks. Utilities also need to approve solar and battery systems at homes connected to their grids before they’re allowed to be turned on. Solar installers have long complained that
“CEO“
Interconnection rules are complicated, and utilities apply them differently. But reports from solar installers over the years have highlighted problems ranging from
A lack of state regulator oversight for interconnection policies complicates efforts at reform, Josefowitz said.
Regulators in some states like California set rules for all regulated utilities, but other state regulators don’t. Even those that have set statewide guidelines for utilities have been slow to adopt rules that require them to put in place more streamlined processes or take the latest technology advances into account. A “13

Extreme amounts of rooftop solar can cause problems on power grids designed to carry electrons from big substations to customers.
“
That’s why solar companies ranging from nationwide players like Sunrun to regional and local installers are recasting their business approach to include becoming “
Opportunities to earn money for these services are relatively scarce today. But with Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration making it much more expensive and difficult to build more renewable energy to meet the growing demand for electricity, utilities may be well advised to reduce the barriers to installing solar and batteries that can provide it, Mikkelsen pointed out.

I would like to see a spreadsheet breakdown of the various costs. A real world example would make it clear. A 10 kw home system would break down to 25 solar panels, racking system, wiring and conduit, electrical boxes, gateway, 6 laborers, 9 hr each day, 3 days, government permits/inspection, utility permits/inspection, etc. etc. Then a comparison with Australia, some U.S. states, Canada, Germany, etc. I am impressed with Solar Boost in Australia.

Very interesting. My own two stage solar generation and storage residential system installation experience over the last couple of years would make me estimate one third ""soft cost"" impact that could be eliminated by addressing permitting, utility and /or grid operator ""slow walking"" and ""stiff arming"" delays and costs, and local government culture war grandstanding. Coincidently, about the same as the tax credits my projects yielded. But I am aware that community solar and small commercial solar projects face a much higher wave of this sort of idiocy. It would be great to find a path toward accelerating the renewable energy transition in the US in spite of the biosphere killing efforts currently underway.

The UK pays 4x for electricity what it costs in the US...so clearly wind energy isn't very cost effective, same for all their other energy policies.

They have the White House, and more often than not, they have a friendly Supreme Court and a friendly court electorate, except for the very extreme, clearly outside the box, extralegal things that they have done. And in those cases, the courts have been constraining them, and the system is working. But I think it is not going to be any magic person in the House or the Senate. It’s going to take all of us, and it’s going to be the most powerful thing that is changing our ability to slow them down or change outcomes is actually the things that are going on in red states, in red districts where people who normally would be seen as absolutely friendly are questioning what these Republicans are doing.

Such auguries rarely portend well for a startup breaking into a difficult, low-margin commodity business. It seemed, for a moment, that the U.S. was getting its own version of Northvolt, the Swedish company that filed for bankruptcy last fall after trying to build a fleet of battery factories in Europe and North America.
But Jay Bellows, who assumed the position of CEO
““
Retrofitting an existing site could take around a year and a half if key resources like utility hookups are already in place, Bellows said. Besides speed to market, this new approach should “
Why is Kore Power making this pivot now rather than setting out with this plan initially? Broader political trends may have something to do with it.
Kore Power spent the last three years pursuing a loan from the Biden administration’s Department of Energy. Satisfying the DOE“secured a conditional loan for 80850
The Loan Programs Office sprinted to finalize billions of dollars of loans in the last weeks of the Biden administration, but Kore Power’s loan did not make it across the finish line. The Trump administration quickly froze all grants and loans for clean energy initiatives, dimming the prospects for any new loans going out the door.
Thus, Kore Power finds itself heading into the second Trump era without a hefty federal loan in its war chest. Construction costs are now higher than when Kore Power began factory development, Bellows noted. Meanwhile, Chinese producers have kept honing their craft, and battery-pack prices have tumbled lower than ever, ratcheting up the pressure on new U.S. battery aspirants.
Given the state of play heading into 202512CEO“
The news dealt a blow to economic development plans in Buckeye, the city outside Phoenix that Kore had worked with for years to bring the factory to fruition. But Bellows was sanguine about the future of that site. Buckeye is growing at a rapid clip, he said, and the Kore Power land comes cleared for construction, with grid power and access to the highway.
“
Even with an existing structure to work from, developing a battery factory is no walk in the park. The dearth of battery-cell production in the U.S. rules out the possibility of snagging a facility outfitted for that purpose, so Kore Power will have to find the best fit among the population of empty industrial buildings.
Battery factories need specific width and height dimensions to accommodate cell production lines, said energy storage analyst Ravi Manghani, who tracks the industry’s supply chain at data firm Anza Renewables. Utilities across the country are struggling to keep up with fast-growing demand from large industrial users, so to avoid lengthy grid upgrades to power the factory, the site needs to have housed some other ravenously energy-consuming activity.
Kore will also need to assemble a workforce capable of high-precision, highly automated battery cell manufacturing; the company had said it would hire 3000
“
U.S. battery cells are still struggling to match the low costs out of China, even with tariffs and supportive tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, Manghani said. But Section 30110IRA
Manghani said the U.S. currently lacks any large-scale production for lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, the chemistry increasingly favored for grid storage due to its safety and cost advantages. But his firm expects two lithium-iron-phosphate cell factories to open this year. Kore Power won’t be the first to reach that milestone but could follow in a couple of years if its revised plans work out.

_Powering Rural Futures:This five-part series from the Rural News Network explores how industry, state governments, and education systems are training this growing workforce._
The sputtered drone of a vacuum pump filled the former milking barn that now houses Kennebec Valley Community College’s heat pump lab. Instructor Dave Whittemore, who held the yellow vacuum in one hand and displayed an app tracking atmospheric pressure on his phone in the other, explained in a raised voice how to do an “

Six years ago, Gov. Janet Mills traveled to the college to sign a bill aimed at transforming Maine’s market for heat pumps, an environmentally friendly alternative to oil furnaces and gas boilers, and set a goal of installing 1000002025
The state, now a national leader for heat pump adoption, met that goal two years ahead of schedule, and Mills once again traveled to the rural Somerset County campus to announce a new target: another 1750002027
Maine needs skilled workers to reach this goal, demanding training initiatives from all corners of the state to build HVAC
So far, rural counties have seen some of the fastest rates of clean energy worker growth, according to KVCC442020
As part of this push, the community college launched a high-tech heat pump training lab in 2021300300002030

Efficiency Maine, a quasi-governmental agency that oversees the state’s energy efficiency programs, has invested more than $400000KVCC29
Another key piece of state support comes through the Governor’s Energy Office’s Clean Energy Partnership, which has awarded nearly $520223500
But the state still faces a daunting challenge: It must employ more than 140003000020192023
While the state says it remains dedicated to this goal, some in the industry worry federal funding cuts and tariffs could create challenges for the workforce development pipeline.
## Efforts underway in many corners of Maine
Heat pumps have emerged as a pillar of Maine’s clean energy strategy: The units can reduce carbon dioxide emissions between 3853,
Rural areas have historically spent more on energy bills and participated less in residential energy and efficiency financing and rebate programs to lower costs,

Dan Belyea, the system’s chief workforce development officer, said short-term training and scholarship funding are centered on needs that arise in the industry, which the schools gauge by looking at labor market data and talking to employers. Programs that are highest in demand tend to include electrical and heat pump training, Belyea said.

Other clean energy workforce initiatives have popped up across the state. Some employers run their own heat pump or solar installation training labs, and several adult education programs and nonprofits also offer classes designed to help people move into the industry.

Naomi Beal, executive director of passivhausMAINE, noted that getting enough students to attend the training was easier in areas like Portland but trickier in more rural areas.

## A need for more collaboration
In Freeport, Scott Libby, the owner of Royal River Heat Pumps, walked through his training center as he explained that all his workers go through heat pump training that starts with the basics, regardless of experience, to ensure each worker is equipped to handle the job.

Libby, who has worked with the U.S. Department of Energy on workforce development and sits on a new energy-efficiency workforce subcommittee being developed by the Governor’s Energy Office, said he’s aware of a number of different workforce development initiatives but that it’s difficult to comprehend how they all work together.
He said some forms of programming aren’t sufficient for what’s actually needed in the field: Students who sit through a six-week or six-month program that teaches the basics of how heat pumps work may come out with little to no hands-on experience with a power tool or climbing a ladder.
!A person writes on a whiteboard Scott Libby’s Freeport business, Royal River Heat Pumps, trains all of its workers, regardless of experience or former training, to ensure installations are done correctly. (Kristian Moravec)
Libby emphasized the need for more collaboration between different workforce development efforts and a more systematic approach, with quality checks in place. He suggested putting more thought into designing industrial arts and home economics programs in middle and high schools to introduce students to different career pathways early on.
He also said more stringent licensing requirements could help with the quality of workers moving into the field. As it stands, there is no specific licensing required to install heat pumps in Maine, though workers need an Environmental Protection Agency Section 608

The broader challenge he sees for the industry is tariffs, which he fears could lead to higher equipment prices and lower demand. This, in turn, could mean a lower need for workers.

However, some smaller initiatives, such as a revolving loan to help Mainers buy new heat pump systems, face uncertainty as the federal grants funding the project are in flux.

CA can't support all electric homes. This is a dream of WAKO Evromentel groups. Several reasons, 1) CA highest electricity rates 2) no infrastructure to support 3)All electric homes are not reliable, example when the power is off, natural gas homes can still cook, boiling water to stay warm. 4) all electric homes are more expensive to build. 5) LAST FREEDOM OF CHOICE.

If you want buildings to electrify, make electricity cheap. It's that simple. The American South is more electric than California because their electricity is affordable. If you're in PG&E territory, you should be gasifying, not electrifying.
I'm an electrical engineer. I love electric things. But I can use a spreadsheet and the spreadsheet says that gas joules are cheaper than electric joules in California IOU territory by more than the efficiency difference between the appliances. Until that's fixed, electrification initiatives are trying to push a rock uphill.

> make electricity cheap
100% agree. And start with a tariff that encourages efficient energy use, and intelligent participation in the grid.
The existing CEC code requires rooftop solar in new construction. In many cases it also requires adding a battery, and in all cases it requires battery-ready constructions. If we had good tariffs, our buildings could charge from the grid when the electricity is abundant and free (and clean) and would export when it is needed (and well compensated). There is NO reason why our current tariffs do not encourage that behavior.

It doesn't need to be cheap. Just better. Which it is. Safer. Every other country is going electric, and solar, no matter the cost. Because they have sense, and morality. And you are wrong. Going electric, and solar results in little to no utility bills. Like $8 a month on average. Nothing is cheaper than practically free. Much cheaper than gas.

At this point, 90% of new generation added to the CA grid is renewable, and only MAGA crackpots are clueless enough to install gas appliances in homes they own, build or renovate for sale. The idea that modern heat pumps don't work in cold climates is outdated, as already demonstrated by many homeowners in Maine.

Install solar, and your bills each month will be almost zero. Nothing cheaper than that, and cost is not the most important thing. Health, safety, and comfort is.

After years of failing to rein in rapidly rising electricity rates, California lawmakers are hoping a radical new approach — and billions of dollars in state financing — can offer a solution.
Bills moving through the California Senate and Assembly would use money raised from state bonds to help pay for the hugely expensive process of expanding the power grid and making it less vulnerable to wildfires. This path would relieve some pressure on utility customers in California, because funding grid upgrades through bonds is cheaper than doing so through energy bills.
Utility costs have reached a boiling point in California, with customers of the state’s three biggest utilities — Pacific Gas &&

This is ridiculous. Forget the grid. Forget transmission capital expenditures. And forget for profit utility companies. The State should be telling utility companies what to do not the other way around. All monies should go directly to installation of solar and battery storage. Each consumer should be in charge of generating their own energy and storing and sharing based upon their own needs. No more increasing costs, no more blackouts, no more relying on wall street, and no more pollution. Let's go!

re: Ownership of Transmission Facilities...
In addition to the examples you mention, I am familiar with the setup in Spain. There the transmission is owned (and operated) by a national, regulated, company (red electrica de españa). Distribution is also a regulated monopoly (owner varies per region). But Retailing and Generation is deregulated. This seems a reasonable approach balancing regulation, monopolies, and competition.

There should be no for profit utilty companies. Period. Thats the problem with this Corporatocracy. The utility companies created the issue when they failed to maintain their own infrastucture because they wanted to line their pockets instead. Not only should they never have been allowed to pass the expense on to the consumer, but they should have also received additional financial penalties via Court order, to be paid for out of their own profit. Hold these fucking Corporations accountable. They should only be allowed to raise rates or get state funding if they can prove it is critically needed and that they have not made any profit, otherwise all profit needs to be exhausted first. That has always been the normal cost of doing business until we apparently collectively decided to constantly bail these welfare lords out. The CA government, and the U.S. in general, seem to forget that the people rule, not the fucking Corporations. Grow a pair and tell them what they are going to do. Stop asking.

The article states: ""The $15 billion securitization plan in SB 254 and AB 825 is targeted at reducing utility costs and rates in the shorter term.""
The article quotes Vivian Yang: ""“These are big projects that are regardless going to take five to 10 years,” she said. ​“It’s not like we can pass those public-financing bills and then the next year our rates will go down.”
The latter is correct. The basic premise of the article that the bills will reduce costs is wrong. They will possibly keep distant future rates from rising as much as they would otherwise but they do nothing to address the short-term affordability crisis. This is predominantly due to the CA government loading programs and costs onto the utilities such as fire programs, rooftop solar, energy efficiency, demonstrations, etc. All of these should be moved to the state budget where more of the cost of these programs would fall on higher income households.

The question is why do California utilities pay twice the average of the rest of the country for energy? Regulations for green energy put in place by the legislature. Did the author discuss root causes? Not really. Journalists and the legislature are just as useless and partners in crime. I expect the solutions to the problems they created will be just as bad. At the end of the day, if energy prices they created get too expensive, they'll want to socialize it and make us pay for it that way. Too predictable.

Opt everyone into a community choice aggregator on a 100% renewable plan (people can later opt out or switch to a cheaper plan)
Directly subsidize rooftop solar + battery + net metering. Solar on every roof.
Get us all off of natural gas.
Install miles or buried transmission lines

More and more working class millennials are fleeing the state for affordable and welcoming conservative states that actually support the working class, and don't perpetuate these lies or burden them with absurd costs on energy and food. We need to cut off wasteful spending on this garbage AI hype, and stop falling for these obvious scams before the next Depression comes.

1. The first question the Gov. and the CPUC need to ask themselves is why do ""SOME"" (about 70%) California's pay more than twice the national average while the other 30% pay the national average.
To find the answer to number 1, they would need to ask question #2, which utilities serve those 70% of customers who pay such high rates?
The answer to number 2 is PG&E, So. Cal Edison, and SDG&E. These are all IOU's (investor owned utiliites). Municipal utilities in the State, such as SMUD, offer rates more than 50% less than the IOU's.
Then one needs to ask question #3, which govt. agency regulates the IOU's?
That would be the CPUC.
For the past 10 years, the CPUC simply rubber stamps every request made by the IOU's. And the result is cost rising more than twice the rate of inflation since 2017. Prior to that rates were a bit higher than the national average, but not significantly, and they typical increase annually at the rate of inflation.
And who appoints members to the CPUC? That would be the governor.
The fault lies 100% with the CPUC and governor who has the responsibility to appoint competent people and replace those who are incompetent.

Second Harvest and Piedmont Environmental Alliance hoped the project would serve as a beacon to other nonprofits looking to go solar. And in and around Winston-Salem, that’s starting to come true, Eley says.

Now, Eley said, the groups he’s working with are especially motivated to act quickly.

That’s because the massive budget bill passed last month by the House — dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in an homage to President Donald Trump — would make tax credits for solar and other renewable energy projects nearly unusable. The Senate is now considering whether to pass the measure as is or to make changes.

Outside the individual homes of the participants, batteries have the potential to reshape the electric-supply system and protect ratepayers’ wallets.

What is NY going to do when everyone comes home and plugs their EVs into the grid and then goes into their homes and turns on their electric ACs, and turns on their electric stoves ???? I don't feel one bit sorry for Con Edison. Now they get to take all their increases and spend it on the grid like they were supposed to all these years. They can get more money from Gov. Hochul to help them out too. $850/month is more than enough for me and I'm moving out of NY so I don't have to pay it anymore.

As winter turns to spring, Texas is setting new records with its nation-leading clean energy fleet.

The famously developer-friendly Lone Star State has struggled to add new gas power plants lately, even after 1ERCOT2024

At some level, the March records show clean energy excelling in the conditions that are most favorable to it. Bright sun and strong winds boosted renewable generation, while temperate weather kept demand lower than it would be on a hot summer or a cold winter day. But those seemingly balmy circumstances could belie a deeper threat to the Texas energy system.

Last summer produced ample data on how the surge in solar and battery capacity reduced the threat to the grid from heat waves and lowered energy prices for customers. This spring, batteries and renewables are showing they can also fill in the gaps when traditional plants step back.

Brooke Canova was nervous after she and her husband bought their Ford F-150
She wasn’t worried about running out of charge and being stranded on the road, or whether the truck would have enough oomph to merge onto a speeding highway. Canova, a health and physical education teacher and mother of a preteen son in Charlottesville, Virginia, fretted about the vehicle’s size.

The purchase was a sort of compromise: Her husband had long wanted a truck, and she finally agreed to go along if it was electric.

Cooper and other advocates acknowledge that long road trips in EVs still require more planning than those in conventional gas-powered vehicles. And the price of entry to drive electric, while falling, is still too high for many.

I love the name of the campaign. What's holding back women from buying EVs? It's functionality, style, purchase price, and the perception of potentially being stranded. The design of most EVs to date has limited women's interest. 5 seats doesn't work for a large portion of the female driving population. For women who drive babies, kids, and/or elderly relatives, the ease of getting in/out of most EV models is not great. Many women drivers need to be able to seat 6 (or more!) people (comfortably). Yes, the purchase price needs to be reasonable $30K or less is what most drivers (of any gender) need (financing higher price vehicles is hard). A lot of EV models have looked pretty dorky to date, too, IMHO. That's changing. Kia and Hyundai are set to eat the Big 3's lunch. Chrylser's hybrid options are a great idea.

Re Rivians: I used to think that EVs are expensive to buy but this doesn't really apply to wealthy suburbia which are filled with SUVs and top trim minivans costing 60 to 90.000 dollars. Price really shouldn't be the deterrent for this target group, especially accounting for very low fuel and maintenance cost.

I have an EV and started wanting one back in the 90s (about when Lisa Simpson mentioned them). I saved up and am privileged enough to be able to buy one in the last few years. I love it and enjoy sharing my experience with others to show how easy it is to find a place to charge even when going camping to Oklahoma, and that it's getting easier to find charger stations. I live in a home I own and have a charger installed so I can plug in and enjoy not worrying so much about finding chargers around town or paying at a station unless I forget to charge.
I have two young children and two large dogs, and the safety as well as the mass amount of storage space works well for me with the sports and activities my kids are into. I love the ability to pre-cool or heat my car, the seat heaters for all passengers, and the room in the back for the kiddos. I love the fact the car drops the seat and pulls up the steering wheel for easy entry when I get into my car, and then has a setting for my favorite seat position saved to my profile. I really also like the security cameras that record on parking that I can see from my phone, the use of my phone and watch as a key (yay no keys), as well as all the camera assists I get switching lanes on the crazy highways we have here in Texas. I like taking mine camping and being able to plug in to the RV park with an adapter, folding down the back seats and using that as our tent.
I love that other manufacturers have started making more affordable and useable ev's in different styles. I'm not sure I like the styles, but they're better than those old prius ones with the wheels covered and collecting rust. l have coworkers who own the Kia and it's solid too. I have friends in apartments that would have to have access to a charger at or near their apartment or work to be able to have one. I think Hybrids are a good idea for those that cannot get to a charger consistently. I think seeing other women and talking about use of EVs for everyday use is a great idea and will build trust in these vehicles.

Americans are expected to install 33forecast, which was based on a version of the law that would have also scrapped a separate tax credit that applies to leased systems.
The repeal of the 25 tax credit, which knocks 30, will make the technology significantly more expensive. The incentive was originally available until 2035
Already, residential solar is far more expensive in the U.S. than elsewhere, and high interest rates as well as recent state-level policy developments are eating further into the economics of buying panels. Even before the repeal, rooftop solar installations were declining year over year because of these trends.
In 20258202626
Rooftop solar is an important piece of the energy transition. In California, photovoltaic panels on roofs produce almost as much power as the sprawling large-scale arrays found in fields and desert areas.
But it’s also a critical way for people to hedge against utility rates, which have climbed high in recent years and are expected to rise even further as data centers demand more energy and the Trump administration stymies cheap wind and solar power. Most households that install rooftop solar
Still, there are things within the industry’s control, from reining in “virtual power plants, that can help it weather the storm — and make rooftop solar more affordable to Americans even without long-standing tax credits in place.

Please separate fast chargers from Level 2 chargers when reporting such data. Fast chargers are necessary for longer trips, for which Level 2 chargers are nearly worthless. Level 2 chargers need to be at locations where vehicles are parked for 4+ hours, like lodging or workplaces. Adding 15 miles while parked for shopping is rarely useful, contrary to what many advocates think.

Since launching in 2019low-carbon cement. The company’s technology can make the essential material without using any limestone — the carbon-rich rock that, when heated up in fiery kilns, releases huge amounts of planet-warming gases into the air.
Now, Brimstone is looking to use its same process to supply another emissions-intensive industry: aluminum production.
The Oakland, California-based company sources carbon-free rocks that are widely available in the United States but are primarily used today as aggregate for building and road construction. Brimstone pulverizes those rocks and adds chemical agents to leach out valuable minerals. Certain compounds are then heated in a rotary kiln to make industry-standard cement.
Last month, Brimstone a key ingredient in many clean energy technologies, such as solar panels, heat pumps, power cables, and electric vehicles.
Alumina production today involves extracting and refining a reddish clay ore called bauxite from a handful of countries using environmentally destructive methods. The United States
Brimstone says its approach could reduce or supplant the need to scrape bauxite from overseas mines, a process that generates copious amounts of toxic waste. Instead, the company aims to supply U.S. aluminum smelters by sourcing common calcium silicate rocks from domestic quarries and by using chemicals that can be more efficiently recycled than bauxite.
The strategy might also help the six-year-old startup navigate the fraught early period that many newcomers face when trying to break into giant, incumbent industries. Cement is a fairly cheap and abundant material, and the construction sector is inherently wary of deviating from tried-and-true — if carbon-intensive — practices. But the U.S. makes relatively little smelter-grade alumina, despite the essential role it plays in the country’s economy.

## Tariffs, funding turbulence ensnare aluminum production
Brimstone is expanding its scope during an especially dynamic period for the aluminum sector.
In recent decades, U.S. aluminum producers have significantly reduced domestic production in response to spiking energy prices and increased competition from China.

Brimstone declined to comment on the federal funding fracas, which remains in flux even though federal courts have ordered the flow of investment to resume.
## The case for homemade alumina
Despite the policy uncertainty, there are still potential upsides to making alumina from alternatives to bauxite and within the United States.
Producing alumina using less environmentally intensive techniques — and supplying that material to smelters powered by clean energy — would help lower emissions across the U.S. supply chain and provide much-needed metal for domestic manufacturers. Lessening the country’s reliance on imports could also help insulate the United States from supply chain disruptions and national security risks, according to a

The batteries inside electric vehicles can do a lot more than power a car.
They can back up homes, schools, and businesses during power outages. They can soak up grid power when it’s plentiful and cheap and send it back when it’s scarce and costly. And they could eventually provide enough reliable power to allow utilities to avoid building more power plants or expanding their grids to meet growing demand for electricity — something that would save money for utility customers as a whole.
So far, utilities have had a hard time turning this dream of batteries on wheels into a reality. Plenty have launched these “V2XEV
In Massachusetts, a new many V2X, this one will offer two key financial incentives: bidirectional chargers at no cost to participants, and real money to those who commit to letting utilities tap into their EV
Over the next nine months, the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, the state’s clean-energy economic development organization, will use most of the pilot’s $6100EV
Those chargers will be installed by December, said Elijah Sinclair, MassCEC clean transportation program manager. The goal is for the pilot to provide about 15250

## Can vehicle-to-everything programs save money?
The idea of pulling power from EVV2X
Other countries have more fully embraced the technology. Japanese automakers started enabling EVs to provide backup power via vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-building charging to deal with the power supply emergencies that followed the 2011V2G
In the U.S., by contrast, vehicle-to-grid services have largely been successful in just one niche of the EVelectric school buses, which happen to sit unused during most of the day. In Massachusetts, the company Highland Electric Fleets and the city of Beverly have been doing V2G2020, and have been earning
Transit and commercial vehicles, which must be on the road more frequently and have less idle time to charge, are more challenging to make profitable.
Vehicle-to-home backup power, meanwhile, has been built into the Nissan Leaf for more than a decade, and has been a major marketing draw for the Ford F-150EVEV
So said Kelly Helfrich, who leads the transportation electrification practice at Resource Innovations, a company specializing in clean-energy program implementation that is co-leading the MassCEC V2XEVV2G
Bidirectional chargers are more costly and technically difficult to build compared to simple one-way chargers. That investment may well be worth it for school buses, which have big batteries that can earn lots of money while they’re sitting idle. But for everyday households, it’s harder to see a path to recouping the extra $500010000
Installing free chargers for homeowners, as the MassCEC program is doing, ““

Right now, the program doesn’t allow residential EVs to send power back to the grid, Woogen noted. But it could allow homes to reduce their grid draw by supplying part of their own electricity use during times of peak demand, or explore other opportunities to reward households for making their vehicles available when power demand is highest.

Other programs offer easy-to-understand and lucrative payments to customers but don’t take on the high up-front cost of setting up bidirectional charging. Maryland utility Baltimore Gas & last year that offers up to $10001509000

The Vehicle-Grid Integration Council’s role in the MassCEC pilot is to organize all these industry participants and to track progress. The first and most fundamental goal, Woogen said, is determining whether bidirectional chargers can “
That’s a work in progress, he said. Over the past decade or so, a V2XEVs themselves to push power back to the grid without a bidirectional charger, although automakers and utilities haven’t gotten to the point of allowing EV

And what percentage of U.S. electricity comes from wind and solar?

I’m using old numbers, but back in 2018, about 7% of US electricity capacity was supplied by Wind power and about 2-3% were supplier by solar. 10 percent was supplied by hydro and about 15-20 percent were supplied by nuclear (that nuclear percentage has since cratered). Geothermal was at about 1-2%. the rest largely was dominated by “natural” gas (about 40%), and coal was already on the decline. The solar numbers have since tripled to almost 5-6% since the passage of the inflation reduction act and the wind numbers unfortunately have been stuck in place (guess what happens when tax credits don’t stay fixed at one level for a long time horizon…). But here’s the kicker: the states that produce the most wind and most solar are not blue states — Texas leads the pack, with a staggering 25-30% of electricity in the state being supplied by wind power alone and about 8% coming from solar power. If it were its own country, Texas would dominate the renewable percentages on that chart.

As for national clean energy grid numbers, all the countries mentioned should be commended, yet no mention of USA.
So here it is: In the first four months of 2025, wind and solar combined provided 20.3% of the total US electricity generation, up from 18.5% in early 2024. In April 2025, wind and solar accounted for 24.6% of total US electrical output. Solar alone provided over 10% of national output in April 2025. For full-year 2023, wind contributed 10.2% and solar 3.9% (utility-scale) of US electricity generation. Including small-scale solar, the total solar share is higher, as noted in the 2025 data above.
I installed rooftop PV (8KW) to our grid-home activation in Jan. 2014, and later added two Tesla Powerwall (10 KWh) batteries in 2019. Since that time, we have been fully grid-independent, which now serves mainly as a large capacity back up for our home in case of an internal system failure -- which has also have happened.
The grid service failures totaled 20 separate outages events over the past 12 months, 17 of those service failures ""each"" lasted less than one hour. During that same period 3 separate service outages were greater in duration than one hour, the longest service outage lasting 4 hours in duration. Cable/landline services went dark during the grid failures, while our internet fiber service was unaffected. At home would we have never known there was a power issue, as our home microgrid performed exactly as it was designed, i.e. to be fully grid-independent in the event of a service failure.

The U.S. solar energy industry has succeeded in doing something that would have been hard to imagine a few years ago: It has officially built more than enough factories to meet the country’s demand for solar panels.
The nation can now produce 40GW reported in late 2024SEIA202050GW2030
The factory buildout employs workers across the U.S. in high-tech manufacturing roles and diminishes reliance on China, the long-time leader in solar manufacturing. But solar panels, which industry insiders refer to as modules, are just the last step of the solar supply chain: Currently, U.S. factories assemble modules from solar cells that are almost exclusively produced overseas. Those cells, which convert sunlight into electricity, incorporate wafers that are meticulously sliced from silicon ingots; factories that make ingots, wafers, or cells are more complex and capital-intensive than module assembly plants.
Those precursor steps have lagged behind the U.S. module buildout, but companies have pledged to build factories for 56GWSEIA
In November, legacy solar manufacturer Suniva kicked off the first new domestic cell production since U.S. producers (2010ES5003GW
Five more cell factories are under construction, per SEIA33GW1GW
But President Donald Trump swiftly attacked his predecessor’s investments in clean energy, signing an order on his first day in office to “
Some companies are thus holding back on solar-cell factory investments until they see what the Trump administration does with a key manufacturing tax credit, which has proven vital to secure construction loans.
## Cell factories require much bigger investment than panels
The rebirth of U.S. solar manufacturing had to start somewhere, and assembling panels made sense as that first step. Now, all those panel makers could become anchor customers for the next link in the chain — the proposed cell manufacturers. But making that jump isn’t so easy.
Take the case of Heliene, a company based in Ontario, Canada, that nonetheless has established its bona fides as a committed U.S. solar manufacturer.
Heliene opened a solar-module factory in Mountain Iron, Minnesota, back in 201780032052013GW
In November, when previously bankrupt Suniva began the first U.S. cell production in years, Heliene swooped in to purchase every cell Suniva’s new factory could make. Heliene could, for the time being, tout its products as the only U.S.-built modules filled with U.S.-built cells.
Now Heliene is working on its boldest move yet: a $200CEO
Building a cell factory requires a significant step up in dollars and complexity compared with a module-assembly plant, Pochtaruk explained. Putting panels together is a largely mechanical task that costs around $30
Solar-cell production costs more than four times that, at about $130“
Cell production exposes silicon wafers to chemicals in liquid and gaseous forms, which must unfold in precisely calibrated environments, Pachtaruk added. Water used in the process requires treatment before it can be reused or sent to the sewer. The equipment to do all these things drives up costs relative to module assembly and makes permitting more complicated.
That raises the stakes for anyone looking to put their chips on the table for American solar-cell production — even if they’ve already found success in their panel-assembly bets. The prospects of financing these bigger bets are intimately tied to the future of federal manufacturing tax credits, part of the Biden policies that Trump has vowed to dismantle.
## Tax credits unlock financing for pricey cell factories
Even successful solar manufacturers typically don’t want to fork over their own cash for the hefty expense of a new cell factory. They turn to lenders to finance construction costs. But lenders have a hard time loaning money to a type of business without much of a track record to evaluate, and the current U.S. cell-manufacturing landscape is mostly nonexistent.
Cell manufacturers have something else going for them, though: the 45 tax credit. As enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act of 202245 awards a set amount of money for each key solar component that a company makes in the country in a given year. If the manufacturer doesn’t have enough tax liability to absorb all that credit, it can sell the credits to another entity, generating cash to pay down debt or invest in further expansion.
Heliene pulled that off last fall with 45 credits from module production and
Financial institutions mulling a $10045 credit as collateral, Pochtaruk said. Future cell sales may be hard to predict, but a guaranteed payout based on the number of cells produced is easy to model (at least in a world where the U.S. government honors legally binding contracts and pays its obligations).
“
The potential loss of tax credits may be less consequential to companies like Qcells, which can draw construction funds from its corporate parent, Korea’s Hanwha. A smaller solar-focused company like Heliene doesn’t have other corporate coffers to rely on in lieu of tax-credit–based financing.
It’s still entirely possible that the credits will survive. Under normal circumstances, it would take a new act of Congress to undo them. A cadre of Republicans in Congress has publicly urged leadership to preserve them, based on the economic benefits they bring to their districts. Meanwhile, SEIA100
The current uncertainty, though, is at the very least delaying the commitment of more private funds to build solar-cell factories. Those projects — and the high-tech, well-paying manufacturing jobs they come with — could collapse altogether if the situation persists or Congress undoes the recently created tax credits.

Analysts saw the tightening of the tax credit’s timeframe down to this one-year sprint as the final nail in the coffin for offshore wind farms that were fully approved but not currently underway.
Two projects — MarWin, the first phase of the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, and New England Wind off the Massachusetts coastline — exist in that gray zone. If the judge yanks its approval, MarWin will almost certainly be mothballed for the rest of Trump’s tenure.

U.S. utilities are spending more than ever on their transmission grids. So why has the construction of new long-range, high-voltage power lines — the kind that experts say the country desperately needs — slowed over the past decade?
Claire Wayner, a senior associate at think tank RMI
In a “
Many of these projects are clearly needed to bolster parts of the grid that were built more than half a century ago. But with less oversight, they tend to cost utility customers more than bigger, regionally planned grid projects, which require utilities, state regulators, and regional grid operators to assess costs and benefits and agree on how to share construction expenses.
That’s a complex and time-consuming process. But the longer-range, higher-voltage power lines that typically result can deliver far greater benefits per dollar of investment than piecemeal, utility-by-utility buildouts, according to
Wayner thinks reforms are needed to push utilities and grid operators to take what RMI““
Today, however, transmission planning is like ““
The U.S. needs more regional transmission than ever to allow clean energy to replace retiring fossil-fuel power plants, to transmit energy further and clear grid congestion spots, and to make the grid more resilient against extreme weather. But the more local projects eat up money, the less there is for projects that could deliver bigger benefits.
The result, Wayner said, has been “

These various policies and exemptions — and their implications for federal, regional, and state authorities — are at the heart of the regulatory gap, Wayner explained in a December webinar discussing RMI
At the federal level, FERC“““
At the state level, utility regulators can require local projects to secure state permits. But many exempted projects are bundled into infrastructure spending requests within sprawling and complex utility rate cases, which makes it much harder for regulators to demand more information about them.
What’s more, FERC
As for the planning entities and grid operators that manage regional planning, they’re not actually regulators, said Ari Peskoe, director of the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. Instead, they’re organizations made up of the same utilities that are incentivized to push projects that maximize profits.

These are all well-known problems, and FERCFERC

This is the second article in our series ​“ _Boon or bane: What will data centers do to the grid?”_
There’s no question that data centers are about to cause U.S. electricity demand to spike. What remains unclear is by how much.
Right now, there are few credible answers. Just a lot of uncertainty — and “
Utilities in major data center markets are under pressure to spend billions of dollars on infrastructure to serve surging electricity demand. The problem, Koomey said, is that many of these utilities don’t really know which data centers will actually get built and where — or how much electricity they’ll end up needing. Rushing into these decisions without this information could be a recipe for disaster, both for utility customers and the climate.
Those worries are outlined in a AI“““
Several uncertainties make it hard for utilities to plan new power plants or grid infrastructure to serve these data centers, most of which are meant to power the AI
AIAI2024AI
It’s also hard to figure out whose data is trustworthy.
Companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, and xAI each have estimates of how much their demand will balloon as they vie for AIAI
These uncertainties make it nearly impossible for utilities to gauge the reality of the situation, and yet many are rushing to expand their fleets of fossil-fuel power plants anyway. Nationwide, utilities are planning to 20
If utilities build new power plants to serve proposed data centers that never materialize, other utility customers, from small businesses to households, will be left paying for that infrastructure. And utilities will have spent billions in ratepayer funds to construct those unnecessary power plants, which will emit planet-warming greenhouse gases for years to come, undermining climate goals.
“
Some utilities and states are moving to improve the predictability of data center demand where they can. The more reliable the demand data, the more likely that utilities will build only the infrastructure that’s needed.

Koomey highlighted one big challenge facing utilities and regulators trying to interpret these forecasts: the significant number of duplicate proposals they contain.
““
It’s hard to sort out where this “
To make things more complicated, local forecasts are also flooded with speculative interconnection requests from developers with land and access to grid power, with or without a solid partnership or agreement in place.
“AECOM
That puts utilities in a tough position. They can overbuild expensive energy infrastructure and risk whiffing on climate goals while burdening customers with unnecessary costs, or underbuild and miss out on a once-in-a-lifetime economic opportunity for them and for their community.
## Getting a grip on what’s coming onto the grid
In the face of these risks, some utilities are trying to get better at separating viable projects from speculative ones, a necessity for dealing with the onslaught of new demand.
Utilities and regulators are used to planning for housing developments, factories, and other new electricity customers that take several years to move from concept to reality. A data center using the equivalent of a small city’s power supply can be built in about a year. Meanwhile, major transmission grid projects can take a decade or more to complete, and large power plants take three to five years to move through permitting, approval, procurement, and construction.
Given the mismatch in timescales, “AECOM“
Koomey, Das, and Schmidt highlight work underway on this front in their February report: “‘
Some utilities are still failing to better screen their load forecasts, however — and tech giants with robust clean energy goals such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are speaking up about it. Last year, ““““
Utilities also have incentives to inflate load forecasts. In most parts of the country, they earn guaranteed profits for money spent on power plants, grid expansions, and other capital infrastructure.
As a matter of fact, many utilities have routinely “
## Making data centers pay — and promise to stick around
In the face of this gap between what’s being demanded of them and what can be built in time, some utilities are requiring that data centers and other large new customers prove they’re serious by putting skin in the game.
The most prominent efforts on this front are at utility American Electric Power. Over the past year,

But eventually, Koomey said, these policy debates will have to reckon with a fundamental question about data center expansion: “

Not all data centers bring the same economic — or social — benefits. Policies aimed at forcing developers to prove their bona fides may also need to consider what those data centers do with their power.
Take crypto mining, a business that uses 0623
Crypto mining operations are also risky customers. They can be built as rapidly as developers can connect containers full of servers to the grid and can be removed just as quickly if cheaper power draws them elsewhere.
This puts utilities and regulators in an uncomfortable position, said Abe Silverman, an attorney, energy consultant, and research scholar at Johns Hopkins University who has held senior policy positions at state and federal energy regulators and was a former executive at utility NRG

Just over a year ago, the world’s first commercial hydrogen ferry officially set sail in the San Francisco Bay, offering a clean, quiet rebuttal to the noisy, polluting ferries that many coastal cities depend on.
Now, the vessel’s owner is working to build a bigger, faster version in New York.

Some of the nation’s biggest ferry operators — including those in New York City, San Francisco, and Washington state — are starting to test and deploy cleaner marine technologies to meet their climate goals and improve air quality in waterfront communities.
Last month, New York City launched a $33 that uses batteries and diesel generators. A handful of other hybrid and fully battery-powered vessels are operating or under construction nationwide, and hundreds more have hit the water in China and Europe.
For now, Switch’s San Francisco ferry is the only fully hydrogen-powered vessel in the U.S.
The boat, called Sea Change, launched in July 20247536060010246
The New York ferry will be twice the size and operate twice as fast as Sea Change, said Seamus Nolan, Switch’s director of commercial and government affairs. He said the $2
Just as crucial as launching the ferry will be establishing a hydrogen supply chain for this specific project, given that no such networks exist today in the U.S. maritime industry. Nolan said that Switch has identified three potential suppliers of green hydrogen — made from renewable energy sources — that could initially serve the new vessel’s operations, though future supplies could include hydrogen made from nuclear or methane pyrolysis as those production methods scale.
A lack of cheap, clean hydrogen remains one of the biggest barriers to taking fuel-cell ferries mainstream. It’s also a key reason why ferry operators are primarily turning to battery-powered boats to begin greening their fleets. Hydrogen fuel is substantially more expensive to make and transport than diesel fuel, and producers remain reluctant to ramp up supplies — and thus drive down prices — given the uncertainty around customer demand.
This was already true under the Biden administration. Now the second Trump administration is moving to scrap federal policies meant to accelerate production of clean hydrogen, including by potentially 7hastens the phaseout of the 45 tax credit for clean hydrogen production.

He graduated in May with two associate degrees and a handful of certifications for work on heating, ventilation and air conditioning, electrical, and solar equipment. (Ben Earp/Ben Earp Photography)
_Powering Rural Futures:This five-part series from the Rural News Network explores how industry, state governments, and education systems are training this growing workforce._
When Mason Taylor was getting ready to graduate from high school in 2022
Taylor grew up in the town of Dryden in rural Lee County, in the westernmost sliver of Virginia between Kentucky and Tennessee. He had come to love the electrical courses he took in high school because there was always something new to learn, always a new way to challenge himself.
Driving to Tennessee for work would likely mean two hours commuting each day.
Taylor, now 21
A summer apprenticeship learning how to install solar arrays helped him get on-the-job training and opened up connections to local work.
A regional partnership working to add solar panels to commercial buildings in the region aims to train young people as they go, developing workforce skills in anticipation of increasing demand for renewable energy-focused jobs in the heart of coal country, where skill sets and energy options are both changing.
Virginia ranks eighth in the nation for installed solar capacity, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, but so far, major renewable energy projects have been clustered in the eastern and southern regions of the state. Increasing the popularity of solar power in the far southwestern corner of the state depends in part on the availability of trained workers like Taylor.
Andy Hershberger, director of Virginia operations for Got Electric, said the electrical contractor firm has had an apprenticeship program nearly since the company’s founding.
The company, which has about 100402012
More recently, the two companies began working to set up a training program that was more focused on solar. The catalyst was the former superintendent of Wise County schools, a school division that had signed up to put solar panels on its facilities. The superintendent saw the installation as an opportunity to get his students hands-on work on a renewable energy project.
Approximately three dozen apprentices have signed up for the program since 202213
“
On top of hourly pay, apprentices get free equipment and a transportation subsidy, along with nine community college credits at Mountain Empire Community College, which provides classroom training before students step onto the job site.

He was in the 2022
He got a job offer from Got Electric at the end of that summer.
This summer, Secure Solar Futures and Got Electric will join forces again to install more than 1600
The 777
Hershberger said he sees interest in solar growing.
“
Mountain Empire Community College offers solar training as a standalone career studies certificate or as part of its larger energy technology associate degree program.
In Southwest Virginia, a solar installation project is more likely to consist of adding panels to homes and businesses rather than building the large, utility-scale ground-based facilities more commonly seen in Southside Virginia, said Matt Rose, the college’s dean of industrial technology.
On a larger project, a single worker might have a specialized role, performing the same task across a large number of panels. On a smaller project, a worker is more likely to be involved in more aspects of the job.
“
Last year, 10
Rose said the college’s students typically start out making $1718
Nationwide, the median salary for electricians is about $61000
In Lee County, population 2200042000
The number of solar installers in Southwest Virginia is unclear. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn’t collect data on employment by technology, so residential solar installation companies are labeled as electrical contractors, along with all other electrical businesses, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
Tony Smith, founder and CEO2022
Smith said it’s tough to replicate the apprenticeship program at various school divisions. Doing so requires the work of individual school systems and the regional community colleges, instead of being able to pick up the curriculum from one area and apply it at the next project site.
And all the partners — Smith’s company, participating schools and installation firms — face some uncertainty for each project. It’s challenging to pinpoint the timing of projects so that students have the time to participate during the summer months, he said.

Taylor uses similar skills at work each day. But his work site looks a lot different from Hamilton’s.
It has taken Taylor some time to figure out how to stick close to home while working in his trade. He spent a year working with Got Electric immediately after finishing his summer apprenticeship, then left the company to work as an electrician in a local school system. He eventually returned to Got Electric for a few months, working at Virginia Tech putting solar on three buildings on campus in Blacksburg, three hours from home.
He discovered he didn’t like traveling for installation jobs that meant night after night in a motel room.

Now he’s an electrician at a state prison in Big Stone Gap. He has the same shift every day, in the same place, and drives 10
Taylor has also taken additional classes at Mountain Empire and wants to go back this fall to finish his associate degrees in HVAC
Rose, the dean at Mountain Empire, noted that once major solar projects are done, maintenance doesn’t require ongoing jobs, and most students who receive training in solar installation typically make it part of another job, such as being an electrician.
“
Rose predicts interest in solar will grow as more homeowners and business owners look for ways to offset rising electric bills.

Energy independence, he added, fits with the character of Southwest Virginia.

It’s been a bad week for the U.S. energy transition.
President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans effectively repealed large swaths of the landmark Inflation Reduction Act last Friday, a move that will set back the nation’s efforts to decarbonize just as they were gaining steam.
But the United States is not the only country in the world. It’s one of the biggest emitters, true, but it’s responsible for only about 13
And luckily, even as Trump hitches the U.S. to fossil fuels, the world is continuing to move quickly toward cleaner sources. Let’s take a tour of some global energy-transition bright spots.

In the European Union, EU2215th
Across the entire world, 2invested in clean energy, efficiency, and the grid for every $1more than 90 of the new electricity built globally was clean energy. Meanwhile, EV2024
To be clear, the trajectory the world is on right now is not fast enough to meet global climate commitments. All of the progress mentioned above needs to accelerate further — and the U.S. resisting the energy transition is a big deal. But with or without the U.S., the global energy transition is happening, and a future that’s powered by solar, wind, batteries, nuclear, and other forms of carbon-free power is on the way.
## More big energy stories
Megabill fallout
One week ago today, Trump signed the GOP
The law made deep cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act, the national climate law passed by the Biden administration in 2022energy prices are going to rise, too. If you’re looking for a piece to share widely that covers the basics, try this one I published on Monday.
Every sector faces slightly different challenges from the law. Even geothermal energy, a favored clean energy source among Republicans, faces a rocky road, Canary’s Maria Gallucci reported this week. The law could have been worse for solar and wind — but it will still pose big challenges, Jeff St. John reports. It could even prevent some fully permitted offshore wind projects from moving forward, Clare Fieseler writes.
Trump’s pro-coal push faces challenges
A month and a half ago, the Department of Energy ordered two fossil-fueled plants that were on the brink of shutting down to stay open. It might have been an opening salvo in a major effort from the Trump administration to keep aging, dirty coal plants open past their planned close dates, Jeff St. John reported this week.
The move comes as the Trump administration, and in particular DOEDOESarah Shemkus reports for Canary Media.
Now, state regulators and environmental and consumer groups are challenging the legality of Trump’s pro-coal intervention, arguing that the grid can be safely run without it.

An efficient electric heat pump wears a snowy cap with icicle fringe in Maine. (
For most U.S. homes, heat pumps are a no-brainer: They can lower energy bills and eventually pay for themselves all while slashing carbon emissions. But the economics don’t work in favor of heat pumps for every home — and particularly not for those in states that have high electricity prices relative to those of fossil gas.
Adjusting the structure of customer electricity rates could turn the tables, according to a report out today from the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, or
The ratio of average electricity prices to gas prices (both measured in dollars per kilowatt-hour) is known as the “
Worse, heat pump performance can decrease significantly when it’s extremely cold (like below 5“ACEEE
The weather might be hard to change, but the spark gap is malleable: Utilities, regulators, and policymakers can shape electricity rates. By modeling rates for four large utilities in different cold-climate states, ACEEE
## Flat rates punish heat pump owners
Flat electricity rates are a common practice. They’re also the worst structure for heat pumps, Malinowski said.
When utilities charge the same per-kilowatt-hour rates at all hours of the day, they ignore the fact that it costs more to produce and deliver electricity during certain hours. That’s because, like a water pipe, the power grid needs to be sized for the maximum flow of electrons — even if that peak is brief. Meeting it requires the construction and operation of expensive grid infrastructure.
Flat rates spread the cost of these peaks evenly across the day rather than charging customers more during the high-demand hours that cause a disproportionate amount of grid costs.
But heat pumps aren’t typically driving peak demand — at least, not for now while their numbers are low. Demand usually maxes out in the afternoon to evening, when people arrive home from work, cook, do laundry, and watch TV
Heat pumps “
Under a flat-rate design, cold-climate heat pump owners ““
## Alternative rate designs can improve heat pump economics
A rate design that bases charges on when electricity is used would help course-correct. Known as ““
Utility ComEd serving the Chicago area is working to finalize time-of-use rates for households, joining the ranks of several other U.S. providers that already offer this structure, like Xcel Energy in
Demand-based rates are another way of accounting for a customer’s peak demand profile and can help reduce a heat pump owner’s energy bills. This approach tacks on fees scaled to a customer’s peak demand that month. If it’s 31030lowers
Even though households switching from gas to heat pumps under such a program would see higher charges for peak demand than before, Malinowski said “
Winter discounts also help heat pumps make financial sense. In most states, electricity usage waxes in the summer — when people blast their air conditioners — and wanes in the winter, when many residents switch to fossil-fuel heating.
Some utilities offer reduced electricity prices in winter to drum up business, a structure that benefits households who heat their homes with electrons. Xcel in Minnesota 1311839

However, a 35% winter discount rate can keep the energy bills of customers with electric heat pumps (light blue) or heat pumps combined with weatherization (mint green) from rising. (ACEEE)
One more option for utilities and regulators: discounts specifically for customers with heat pumps. 12RMI
Massachusetts regulators approved a plan by utility Unitil last June to offer a wintertime heat-pump discount — the first in the state — and directed National Grid to develop one, too. Unitil’s discount amounts to at least 202027
The takeaway from ACEEE
But in other cases, additional policy might be needed. Connecticut’s electricity prices are so high that these rate structures weren’t enough to close the spark gap, the authors found. They recommend policymakers consider broader changes like clean-heat standards that require utilities to take steps toward decarbonized heating, or investing in grid maintenance and upgrades to make electricity more affordable — for all customers.

The rooftop solar industry is facing an unprecedented crisis. Utilities are have gone bankrupt. And sweeping legislation just passed by Republicans in Congress will soon cut off federal tax credits that have supported the sector for 20
But the fact remains that solar panels — and the lithium-ion batteries that increasingly accompany them — remain the cheapest and most easily deployable technologies available to serve the ever-hungry U.S. power grid.
Sachu Constantine, executive director of nonprofit advocacy group Vote Solar, thinks that the rooftop solar and battery industries can survive and even thrive if they focus their efforts on becoming “virtual power plants.”
Hundreds of thousands of battery-equipped, solar-clad homes across the country are already storing their renewable energy when it’s cheap and abundant and then returning it to the grid when electricity demand peaks and utilities face grid strains and high costs — in essence, acting as
In places like Puerto Rico and New England, these VPPs have demonstrated their worth in recent months, preventing blackouts and lowering costs for consumers, and the approach could be scaled up dramatically. “
Right now, there aren’t many other options for meeting soaring energy demand, he added. The megabill signed by President Donald Trump this month undermines the economics of the utility-scale solar and battery installations that make up the vast majority of new energy being added to the grid. And despite the Trump administration’s push for fossil fuels,
Meanwhile, the U.S. power grid has not expanded quickly enough, increasing the risk of outages and subjecting Americans to the burden of rising utility rates, Constantine said. State lawmakers and utility regulators are

The impacts of distributed solar and batteries aren’t always so easy to track — but clean-energy advocates are busy calculating where they’re making a difference.

## Getting states to embrace VPPs
Sunrun, Vote Solar, and Solar United Neighbors have been working for the last year to advance state policies that support VPPs. So far this year, the groups have promoted

The legislative effort has had less luck in New Mexico and Minnesota, where bills failed to advance, Anderson said. In Illinois, a
A lot more batteries are being added to rooftop solar systems in Illinois, Anderson noted — a byproduct of the state played out in Hawaii and California after regulators reduced the value of solar power that customers send back to the grid, making batteries that can store extra power and further limit customers’ grid consumption much more popular.
Rooftop solar advocates have fought hard to retain net-metering programs across the country. But Jenny Chase, solar analyst with BloombergNEF, noted that most mature rooftop solar markets have shifted away from rewarding customers for sending energy back to the grid at times when it’s not needed.
“
VPPs flip this dynamic, turning rooftop solar and batteries from a potentially disruptive imposition on how utilities manage and finance their operations to an active aid in meeting their mission of providing reliable power at a reasonable cost. Utilities have traditionally been leery of trusting customer-owned resources to meet their needs. But under pressure from lawmakers and regulators, they’re starting to embrace the possibilities.
In Minnesota, utility Xcel Energy has proposed a “ that would allow it to own and operate solar and batteries installed at key locations, letting the company defer costly grid upgrades. Rooftop solar advocates have mixed feelings about the proposal, given their longstanding complaints about Xcel’s track record of making it
Similar tensions are at play in Colorado, where Xcel is “
But waiting for utilities to deploy the grid sensors, software, and other technology needed to perfectly control customers’ devices runs the risk of delaying the growth of VPPs, Anderson said. Simpler approaches like those being taken in Puerto Rico — where aggregators manage VPPs — can do a lot of good quickly. “

State- and utility-level incentives that encourage individuals to participate in VPPs are also a vital countermeasure against the damage incurred by the “lose a 30 that offsets the cost of solar, batteries, and other home energy systems by the end of this year.

Every so often I see talk about Virtual Power Plants and it always seems like another article about ""this could solve lots of problems..."". To me, this seems more like a regulatory problem than anything else. But is there a chance to make real progress on VPPs? What are the barriers? My understanding is that we should get away from feed in tariffs (which I understand as payments made to small providers without regard to time of day) and move to a system based on actual prices. While this favors battery + solar, it also seems like the system we need. We should also remove barriers that fail to recognize the benefits solar (or S + battery) provide to the grid (which California, and to a lesser extent Hawaii, seemed to have implemented). And we should reduce barriers (and therefore costs) to installing solar + battery systems so that they can be economically efficient without the need for subsidies.

I agree. Using real total cost (generation + distribution + transmission) and applying it to both imports and exports solves many problems.
Turns out that the California Public Utilities Code has required this since 2001. There is no real reason not to provide an optional tariff based on that. There is a bill in the California legislature that is finally requesting this. AB-1117.

I love the idea of VPPs. I would welcome the opportunity to participate in one, but so far am not aware of any. Battery deployment is key to building VPPs, and the article talks of strategies to get more residential batteries into the energy landscape, avoiding the significant upfront investment using leasing. As someone who owns their own substantial battery bank, I am curious about how participation in a VPP for someone like me would be structured. I'm looking forward to seeing the potential for widespread VPP development realized.

There's a pervasive structural problem hindering rapid progress on transitioning energy from centralized utility monopoly & fossil fuel systems to widely distributed renewable electricity generation, storage & re-distribution. France has already adopted a fix. They've mandated solar canopies on ALL existing parking lots larger than about 80 spaces within 5 years.
When solar panels cover just half of France’s parking lots, they’ll have an installed capacity of between 6.75 gigawatts and 11.25 gigawatts, at a cost of between $8.7 billion and $14.6 billion. France’s 56 nuclear power plants each have a capacity of slightly over 1 gigawatt on average — and one under construction has ballooned in cost to $14 billion — roughly the same as the entire solar expansion.
NetZero Kaiser & Sutter Healthcare facilities built within the past 5 years in northern CA all have solar parking lot canopies +stationary storage BESS +Vehicle-2-BESS chargers shading 80% of their large hot asphalt parking. It’s a multiple win strategy that should be required by commercial building codes & ordinances.
The significance of V-2-BESS is in implementing neighborhood micro grids, where many charger-connected vehicles can provide the aggregate power to flatten the duck curve on local distribution grids, right where most utility rate payers live, work & commute. No new utility monopoly transmission spending required.

The U.S. has been levying tariffs on Chinese solar panels since the Obama administration, when China’s industrial policies boosted manufacturing and helped push American solar manufacturers out of business.

A slew of giga-scale green hydrogen projects have proven to be roads to nowhere. In one such case, Hy Stor had intended to build a hub for low-carbon industry on this patch of land in Mississippi. (Julian Spector/Canary Media)
This week, Senate Republicans joined their House colleagues in proposing to
The Senate and House still need to agree on the final text of the bill, but both chambers would take a decade of incentives meant to incubate green hydrogen production and end them after this year. The truth is, though, even before Republican lawmakers sharpened their knives for the tax credit, the much-anticipated green hydrogen boom had quietly collapsed.
Just a few years ago, green hydrogen developers were planning to invest billions of dollars to build gigawatts of wind and solar capacity in prime locations from the Gulf to the desert Southwest, then funnel that electricity into huge banks of electrolyzers. These devices zap water and deliver pure hydrogen gas without the carbon dioxide released by conventional hydrogen production. Ambitious dreamers even proposed billion-dollar pipelines to carry the gas across Texas to ports on the Gulf, where it could be shipped to buyers in Europe and Asia.
I caught a bit of hydrogen fever myself during a reporting trip along the Gulf Coast in December 2023
In Mississippi, leaders from a company called Hy Stor Energy showed me a vast sandy tract, framed by mastlike pines, where they intended to build a clean industrial park powered by gigawatts of off-grid wind and solar. These power plants would electrolyze hydrogen, which Hy Stor would stash in enormous subterranean storage tanks carved from the region’s salt dome formations. Then steelmakers and chemicals companies would flock there for an uninterrupted supply of undeniably clean hydrogen.
Sure, it sounded bold, but not impossible: Hy Stor’s then-CEO Laura Luce had previously developed salt dome storage for natural gas, and elsewhere in the region, salt dome tanks already store hydrogen molecules for the Gulf petrochemical corridor.

Other firms have canceled projects partway through construction, are holding off on final investments, or have found new customers for their renewables. A few green hydrogen projects are still moving forward, but they’re either in jeopardy, heading overseas, or far more modest than the gigawatt-scale ventures recently under development.

Scaling breakthrough technologies requires faith that costs will fall and customers will want to buy.

Solar panels and battery cells are identical units that get mass-produced economically. Electrolyzer systems require more hands-on and bespoke installation work, with pipes and pumps and compressors and water tanks.
The other problem with analogizing green hydrogen to wind, solar, and batteries is a key difference in their uses. The latter group delivers electricity, which is distributed and used across modern society. But clean hydrogen requires highly specialized infrastructure to transport and utilize the famously flighty molecule.

That’s not to say developers were crazy for trying. A few years ago, major companies in Asia and Europe seemed eager to purchase large volumes of green hydrogen for their decarbonization plans, said Kimber, from Intersect Power. Such high-volume deals were vital for justifying construction of gigawatt-scale electrolysis projects in the sunny, windy sites of the American West.
““
Lacking that kind of anchor customer, a developer can’t justify building big or financing a whole pipeline to market — the billion-dollar gigaprojects depend on high utilization to make any financial sense, Kimber noted. They’re not something you can build and then wait a few years for demand to materialize.

Hydrogen’s critics have long insisted that it never made much sense, either as a decarbonization strategy or a moneymaking venture. They see the industry’s implosion as a chance to avoid plowing billions of dollars into a technological dead end. Many climate advocates have dismissed hydrogen as a guise for fossil-fuel interests to prolong the use of their planet-warming product; they won’t be shedding any tears now.
But for the contingent of hydrogen entrepreneurs who emerged from successful renewables firms, the sudden loss of momentum delivers a yearslong setback in efforts to clean up heavy-duty transport, steelmaking, and other industries that are hard to decarbonize, and a missed opportunity to head off the worst impacts of climate change.
“
The sudden vaporization of the imagined green hydrogen economy may be the kind of healthy correction this market needed. Whichever hydrogen projects ultimately get built could prove more durable for having made it through the ringer after the days of easy money. But that’s paltry consolation for the townships and states that were promised billion-dollar projects and high-tech jobs within a couple years. Beyond the economic hit, the green hydrogen collapse removes a leading contender for cleaning up the most carbon-intensive industries — at least until the next hydrogen boom comes around.

Excellent article (as usual), Julian.
I wonder about a small corner of the hydrogen hype market: the transit systems that have ordered hydrogen fuel-cell buses, assuming there would be a nearby source of green hydrogen to power them. The decision by Fortescue to scrap the Western Washington hydrogen hub at Centralia has that effect on my local transit operator, Intercity Transit (Olympia).
It might be worth an article to reach out to the transit systems that have ordered fuel cell buses (with federal grant money) and counted on local green hydrogen (subsidized by federal grant money and the $3/kg tax credit).
The bus manufacturer, New Flyer, ordered 200 fuel cell systems from Ballard Power last year; those companies might know what's happening with the fuel cell bus market.

The collapse of several U.S. green hydrogen megaprojects, as highlighted in this article, underscores the complex interplay between policy, infrastructure readiness, and market demand. While optimism once drove large-scale plans like Hy Stor’s, the shift in political support and logistical challenges have made investors more cautious. This recalibration doesn’t signal the end of green hydrogen but rather a reset—one where smaller, targeted deployments may pave the way forward. Projects now need to align more closely with near-term, high-value applications instead of relying solely on long-haul export strategies.

“U.S. accounts for nearly 35 percent, or 1.6 metric tons, of the projects that have passed the final investment decisions. However, if the Senate follows the House’s lead and repeals the 45V tax credit, the U.S. risks losing its foothold, ceding ground to foreign competitors. It would also choke off a critical new growth market for American natural gas. Meanwhile, China is moving aggressively. In 2022, the Chinese Communist Party unveiled its first Hydrogen Industry Medium- and Long-Term Development Plan (2021–2035). The effect has been significant. While China accounted for less than 10% of global electrolyzer capacity in 2020, by the end of 2023, it controlled 50% of the market. China’s rapid mobilization should serve as a wake-up call to U.S. policymakers. The same dynamics that enabled China to dominate critical mineral supply chains now threaten America’s future position in the hydrogen market.” — The Detroit News

I would add that the industry had also not really reckoned with the enormous amounts of water this would necessitate, and the briny wastewater left to be dealt with, especially in places like Texas where the aquifer reserves are already a precious resource. But we never really got to that conversation in this industry because it was already dying before it started.

The Trump administration’s latest attack on an offshore wind project could make New England’s electricity less reliable and more expensive.
Late last month, the administration halted work on the nearly complete Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, citing dubious “New England fishermen who voted for Donald Trump oppose the move, which is part of the president’s monthslong assault on an energy source central to the Northeast’s grid and decarbonization plans.
Should Trump tank the project, it would leave a gaping hole in New England’s energy mix, driving up the region’s already-high electricity prices and leaving its grid more vulnerable to collapse during winter storms. New England’s grid operator has already factored the 704“ISO
That’s not to mention the longer-term disruptions that could stem from killing a project that’s followed all the rules and is already about 80
“ISO
In the measured world of grid operators, warnings like these are “
“500ISO
And “100several days in June, ““
But it’s during the winter months that the loss of Revolution Wind could be most keenly felt, said Susan Muller, a senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. That’s when the region’s ISO
But as the move to shut down Revolution Wind shows, the Trump administration’s relentless attacks on the offshore wind industry are making the energy source harder to plan around.
## Keeping energy prices down and the grid up
In the winter, “
That’s an expensive way to keep the lights on. Wholesale power costs from December to February spiked to $416ISO67112
Luckily, strong winter winds make offshore wind farms a great solution to these problems, Muller said — and she has the fancy studies to prove it.
Muller consulted on a 400351
A
The money-saving mechanism is pretty simple, Muller explained. Offshore wind farms are costly to build, and the utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island that signed long-term contracts with Revolution Wind will be paying prices for that power that are higher than the average prices on ISO
Because of this dynamic, the Daymark Energy Advisors analysis found that Revolution Wind’s power would still save consumers money even if the utilities pay twice as much as wholesale prices, Muller said.
Revolution Wind is also meant to supply power to ISO
The project would make it less expensive for the region to meet those peaks, Silverman said, putting New England in a better position than other areas of the country. Grid operator PJM13capacity prices skyrocket in the past year because it has not built new generation fast enough, he noted.
Perhaps even more valuable is that offshore wind can be a buffer against fuel shortages, Muller said. “
This summer, ISOLNG
But out of all those variables, the study’s base case assumes that ISO162027704“
## Why fossil fuels can’t fill the offshore wind gap
Fossil fuels can’t replace the power that would be lost if Revolution Wind isn’t brought online, Muller and Silverman said — even if the Trump administration is touting more gas pipelines as a solution.
Last month, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin
The piece came after the Trump administration lifted a stop-work order on New York’s Empire Wind offshore wind project in May, claiming it had struck a deal with Gov. Kathy Hochul to allow two major gas pipelines to be built in the state. Hochul, a Democrat, has “
Energy experts have pointed out many flaws in the administration’s push for more pipelines, including a lack of capacity to move gas from New York to New England and poor long-term economics for expanding that capacity. Every state in New England except New Hampshire has set clean energy and decarbonization mandates that call for using less fossil gas, not more, in the years to come.
““
The Trump administration has insisted that fossil-fueled power plants must stay open to ensure grid reliability, going so far as to use emergency powers to force coal-, gas-, and oil-burning plants to keep running past their planned retirements. Those orders will force customers to bear tens of millions of dollars or more in unnecessary costs while doing nothing to improve reliability, according to energy analysts as well as the state attorneys general and environmental groups challenging the extensions in court.
Fossil-fueled power plants also pose reliability challenges in cold weather. Gas plants made up the 202120222014“
The cold can cause malfunctions at gas plants themselves, or it can limit fuel supply by spurring breakdowns at the wellheads and compression stations that feed pipeline networks. ISO3948“
All of these factors were considered in the years-long decision-making processes that New England states went through to decide that offshore wind is their best choice, said Larry Chretien, executive director of the nonprofit Green Energy Consumers Alliance.

Since its founding back in 2010800
Like the dozens of other startups at work in this field, Shine Technologies has yet to crack the code on fusion, an energy source that has been 4050
Governments, venture capitalists, tech billionaires, and other private investors around the world have pumped more than $712024
But despite almost a century of research since fusion’s discovery, engineers have been unable to achieve its holy grail: continuously generating more power than was used to create a fusion reaction in the first place. The fusion world uses a metric called the fusion energy gain factor, also known simply as Q, to measure that ratio. If a project was to achieve a Q greater than 1
But Shine has a different benchmark — at least for right now.

## A different kind of fusion company
The fusion reaction is the primordial alchemical trick that powers our sun, propels spacecraft in science-fiction novels and, if the visionaries and true believers are correct, could meet humanity’s voracious energy needs in the centuries to come.
The reaction occurs in plasma, the fourth state of matter. The sun creates plasma by compressing and heating hydrogen to tens of millions of degrees, and it performs the miracle of fusion by confining that hydrogen, along with its variants, with its mammoth gravity.
Humans hoping to recreate the conditions of the sun on Earth have to rely on exotic magnets, Brobdingnagian laser-beam arrays, or other maximalist techniques.
These complex and expensive fusion machines compress and confine plasma in an attempt to bring two nuclei close enough to overcome their repellant electrostatic forces and fuse together. A successful, sustained fusion reaction would heat up a material surrounding the reactor, allowing it to boil water and drive the same sort of conventional steam turbine you’d find in a coal, gas, or traditional nuclear (fission) power plant.
Most of the fusion startups Canary Media has covered — such as Avalanche Energy, and own (unproven) method for controlling the plasma and wringing out the heat. Some firms use a
So, which technology and approach is Shine using to solve the fusion riddle?

And while today’s cadre of fusion startups aims to provide power to the electrical grid in the 20302040

Instead, Shine’s CEO“
The market where Shine is making money now is the sale of neutrons for use in industrial imaging and materials testing. Piefer estimates that this will generate “502025
Shine will next move into medical-isotope production, then
Producing medical isotopes requires fewer sustained reactions than producing power, and while net power is a ways away, the technology for isotope production is already available.
Medical isotopes are currently produced via nuclear fission, but if they can be produced via fusion, that would eliminate the need to use highly enriched uranium. And it could be a lucrative line of business: The global market for medical isotopes is

The prospect of getting a foot in that market drove Shine to break ground on a new facility in Wisconsin, which has already been licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It will be the largest isotope-production factory in the world when it comes online in a few years, according to Piefer. He claims that his firm is the only one that has successfully shepherded a new nuclear technology through the NRC1974

The board’s ruling also noted evidence provided by chapters of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers about jobs and other positive economic benefits. Additional experts for the Ohio Environmental Council described how the solar farm and revenue from it could help local governments deal with climate change impacts.

Still, solar and wind projects continue to face hurdles under state law that don’t apply to fossil fuels. While counties now have the power to block most large solar and wind projects, local governments can’t even enforce zoning restrictions against oil and gas development.

It's been patently obvious for decades now that in general, Republicans are bad for the economy. In any scenario, any case, at any time. Now substitute any other subject in place of ""economy"" in the above sentence to be 100% accurate, no matter what word is chosen. The reason is psychosis. Republicans are consumed by it. Entirely.

Raymond Ward wants to see solar panels draped over every balcony in the United States and doesn’t understand why that isn’t happening.
The technology couldn’t be easier to use — simply hang one or two panels over a railing and plug them into an outlet. The devices provide up to 800780000
Here in the U.S., though, there is no market for balcony solar. Ward, a Republican state representative in Utah who learned about the tech last year, wants that to change. The way he sees it, this is an obvious solution to “‘“
His colleagues agree. Earlier this year, the Legislature unanimously passed a bill he sponsored to boost the tech, and Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed it. “
Utah’s law marks the nation’s first significant step to remove barriers to balcony solar — but bigger obstacles remain. Regulations and standards governing electrical devices haven’t kept pace with development of the technology, and it lacks essential approvals required for adoption — including compliance with the National Electrical Code and a product safety standard from Underwriters Laboratories. Nothing about the bill Ward wrote changes that: Utahans still can’t install balcony solar because none of the systems have been nationally certified.
These challenges will take time and effort to overcome, but they’re not insurmountable, advocates of the technology said. Even now, a team of entrepreneurs and research scientists, backed by federal funding, are creating these standards. Their work mirrors what happened in Germany nearly a decade ago, when clean energy advocates and companies began lobbying the country’s electrical certification body to amend safety regulations to legalize balcony solar.
In 2017VDEVDE
“VDE20182019
The regulatory structure has continued to evolve. Ofenheusle has worked with other advocates to amend grid safety standards, create simple online registration for plug-in devices, and
!Solar panels on a balcony with a roof. A potted plant is also on the balcony. Balcony solar systems feature one or two small photovoltaic panels and a microinverter and generate enough power to charge a laptop or power a small fridge. (Tobias Schwarz/AFP via Getty and Grist)
Meanwhile, the United States has yet to take the first step of creating a safety standard for the technology. U.S. electrical guidelines don’t account for the possibility of plugging a power-generating device into a household outlet. The nation also operates on a different system that precludes simply copying and pasting Germany’s rules. The U.S. grid, for example, operates at 120230
Without proper standards, a balcony solar system could pose several hazards.
One concern is a phenomenon called breaker masking. Within a home, a single circuit can provide power to several outlets. Each circuit is equipped with a circuit breaker, a safety device within the electrical panel that shuts off power if that circuit is overloaded, which happens when too many appliances try to draw too much electricity at the same time. That prevents overheating or a fire. When a balcony solar device sends power into a circuit while other appliances are drawing power from the circuit, the breaker can’t detect that added power supply. If the circuit becomes overloaded — imagine turning on your TV
This was a concern in Germany, so it developed standards that limit balcony solar units to just 800
Another issue in the U.S. is the lack of a compatible safety device called a ground fault circuit interrupter, or a GFCIGFCIGFCI
Some people have raised concerns about the shock risk of touching the metal prongs of a plug after unplugging a balcony solar device. German regulators accounted for that by requiring the microinverter — which converts currents from the panel into electricity fed into the home — shut down immediately in an outage or when it is suddenly unplugged. Most of them already have this feature, but any U.S. standard will likely need to formalize that requirement.
The lack of an Underwriters Laboratories, or UL“ULUL
While some companies have sold plug-in solar devices in the U.S. without a UL

GismoPower sells a mobile carport with a roof of solar panels and an integrated electric vehicle charger. Unlike rooftop solar, the system doesn’t need to be mounted in place but can be rolled onto a driveway and plugged in, generating electricity for the car, house, and the grid. “
GismoPower’s product avoids one of the biggest technical challenges with balcony solar by plugging into a dedicated 240UL“
One major sticking point is that any standard must comply with the National Electrical Code, a set of guidelines for electrical wiring in buildings that does not allow for the installation of plug-in energy systems like balcony solar. The rules are issued by the National Fire Protection Association, a nonprofit trade association, and adopted on a state-by-state basis.
The code is updated every three years, with the next iteration due later this year for the 2026
Jeff Sargent, the National Fire Protection Association’s staff liaison to the National Electrical Code committee, said that this is the first time the organization had received public comments about plug-in solar systems. For now, it cannot consider amendments to allow their use until a compatible ground fault circuit interrupter exists, he said. Once that’s available, he said, the association can ensure that outdoor outlets can be safely used for balcony solar.
Electrical standards are constantly evolving, and it often takes more than one cycle of code changes to allow for new products, said Sargent. Ginsberg-Klemmt said his group will continue to pursue other avenues to amend the codes.

But now, with a fiancee and two children, Pearson is completing a circle by leaving fieldwork and returning to Mitchell Tech to become its only wind energy program instructor.
Pearson said that in addition to teaching the skills needed to thrive in the renewable energy field, he’ll also share the good news about their job prospects.

At Mitchell Tech, Clayton Deuter, the vice president for enrollment services, said the college now offers a one-year wind energy degree instead of a two-year program, a change made after energy companies said some skills taught in the longer program could be obtained on the job instead.
Deuter said the energy programs at Mitchell Tech are an easy sell to students and their parents due to the low cost compared to a four-year college and the availability of Build Dakota scholarships in which students get tuition paid if they work in South Dakota for three years after graduation.
Mitchell Tech also offers a dual-enrollment program to high school students so they can have a wind energy degree from the college in hand by the time they graduate.

## The reliability regime that Trump’s executive order would disrupt
States regulate utilities and thus have primary authority over the nation’s electricity generation. Even within competitive energy markets, where many power plants are owned and operated by companies that aren’t regulated utilities, states retain significant say over which plants are built, kept open, or closed down.
But the federal government also has significant powers, as laid out in the
Two entities are primarily responsible for grid reliability under current law: the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, an agency with commissioners appointed by the president but traditionally independent from political interference, and the North American Electric Reliability Corp., a nonprofit regulatory authority that includes utilities and grid operators in the U.S. and Canada.

Meanwhile, clean-energy backers and climate advocates argue that the nation’s biggest grid-reliability problem isn’t coal plants closing. Instead, they blame the inadequate grid buildout and clogged interconnection queues that have prevented developers from bringing online hundreds of gigawatts of solar, wind, and battery projects — all cheaper than coal and often fossil gas, too.

_The ​“Eating the Earth” column explores the connections between the food we eat and the climate we live in._
These days, I’m sure it’s frustrating and depressing to spend your time thinking about energy and climate issues. Global coal use hit an all-time high last year. So did greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. Now President Donald Trump and his Republican lackeys are maniacally rolling back America’s clean-energy progress, sledgehammering renewables while subsidizing pollution.
It’s awful, I know.
But just think how frustrated and depressed those of us who spend our time thinking about food and climate issues must be.
On energy, there’s at least progress for Trump to roll back. On food, there’s been virtually none. On energy, the world at least knows what it needs to do — electrify the global economy and run it on clean electricity — even if it’s not doing it quickly or consistently enough. On food, the world isn’t even sure what it needs to know, and the problems are quickly and consistently getting worse.
That’s why I wrote my new food and climate book, “303
The book covers dozens of promising food and climate solutions — including some I wrote about for Canary, like this bad-ass super-tree, this eco-friendly bio-fertilizer, high-yield pastures, and high-tech food. The bad news is that none of them have achieved the kind of scale necessary to make a serious dent in emissions. But 20nearly all new U.S. power plants are zero-carbon, while electric vehicles look like the future of transportation.
The additional bad news is that we’re losing a soccer field’s worth of forest to agriculture every six seconds; we’re on track to lose another dozen Californias’ worth of forest by 20502082050
In other words, food needs to get where energy is now in a hurry. So what political lessons can the food world learn from two decades of energy progress?
## The government has to help
The first lesson of the energy transition is that it has required public investment. The U.S. government’s national labs, scientific grants, and other R&“
The Biden administration did start investing in climate-friendly food and agriculture solutions, such as
But the Trump administration is undoing Joe Biden’s green agriculture initiatives, and in any case they were orders of magnitude smaller than the rivers of cash cascading into green energy. That’s a big reason why food and land solutions are off to such a slow start, and why private investment is lagging as well; for example, the cultivated meat industry has attracted $3500
Obviously, the U.S. government won’t invest in climate solutions as long as Trump and the GOP““
A corollary to that lesson is that governments should let a thousand flowers bloom, investing in all kinds of potential alternatives to the status quo. In my last book, “200990
Oh, there were plenty of losers. The most famous was ““. But the green stimulus helped jump-start America’s photovoltaic solar industry and start driving down the price of silicon panels, which is why Solyndra’s and Ivanpah’s more expensive approaches to solar faltered in the marketplace. The stimulus also created a domestic electric-vehicle battery industry, while helping wind power and LED
It’s also important for governments to act on what they learn, rather than continuing to invest in the flowers that fail to bloom. The classic example of throwing good money after bad in the energy space is farm-grown fuels; there’s still bipartisan support for giving the farm lobby the destabilize the climate. Biden was a vocal cheerleader for corn ethanol, and Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, while obliterating tax credits for truly clean energy,
The Biden administration’s first $3didn’t love its focus on scientifically dubious efforts to sequester carbon in farm soils, it did seed an
## All is not lost
Like I said, it can get frustrating and depressing.
To meet those 2050
So yes, change will be extremely hard. But energy’s biggest political lesson for food is that change is possible. Two decades ago, wind and solar power were global rounding errors, a documentary called “
One confounding example: all the confident pronouncements about carrots and sticks. Yes, Obama stimulus goodies helped jump-start the energy transition, while taxes and other restrictions on agricultural pollution in Europe inspired farmers to blockade highways with tractors and dump manure on government buildings.

What does seem to be as true for food as energy is the cliché that there’s no one silver-bullet solution, just the silver buckshot of multiple solutions, although copper buckshot is probably a better metaphor, because the solutions need to get cheap to get to scale. We’ll need all kinds of demand-side solutions — like meatless meats made from plants and fungi and animal cells, as well as anti-food-waste technologies ranging from
Solar panels were invented in the 1950201060
Of course, the development of solar has also been held back by backlash politics; Ronald Reagan removed the panels Jimmy Carter installed on the White House roof, and Trump is trying to crush clean energy while preaching energy dominance. Like I said, progress will be really hard. But it’s also really important. And while perfect probably isn’t on the menu, better is better than worse.
This may be the most important lesson of the energy transition: Climate change is not a pass-fail test. We almost surely won’t meet the Paris goal of limiting warming to 15161743203042“210053
That’s not an inspiring bumper-sticker slogan, but politics is about the slow boring of hard boards. The global economy is not decarbonizing quickly enough, but it’s getting a little bit less dependent on fossil fuels every day, and food can follow a similar trajectory that can help us eat less of the earth.
It isn’t happening yet. Agriculture is still expanding. Forests are still falling. But the Chinese proverb that the best time to plant a tree was 20

But in the absence of federal leadership, states like Michigan, Oregon, Colorado, and California are moving forward with their own plans. Regulatory efforts are underway among these climate leaders to implement stricter rules for landfill operators and require the use of novel technology, like drones and satellites that monitor leaks.

States have an opportunity to step up those standards — not only by lowering emissions limits but by improving the maintenance and monitoring of landfills, said Tom Frankiewicz, the waste-sector methane expert at climate-focused think tank RMI“
In 2010
Now, though, Colorado has taken the lead on a new generation of landfill emissions regulations. The state is developing what some experts are calling a first-of-a-kind program for monitoring and responding to methane leaks from landfills. As part of the initiative, Colorado plans to implement remote-sensing technologies, including fly-overs and satellites, to detect methane leaks, which operators would then be required to address.

In addition, Colorado’s Department of Public Health and Environment is considering additional requirements for landfills that include stricter rules for the maintenance of cover and a lower threshold at which landfills are required to report and control emissions, Garland said.

The state is also looking into other remote-sensing technologies, like drones and on-the-ground infrared monitors, which would provide a more continuous and finer-resolution picture of methane emissions.

U.S. companies that install and finance residential solar have been struggling for years with unfavorable policy shifts in California, the country’s biggest rooftop solar market. Now, they face an even more serious threat — Republicans in Congress, who have proposed to take away the tax credits that undergird the industry.
These mounting pressures have driven two of the most prominent firms in the U.S. residential solar sector into bankruptcy in recent days.
Residential solar provider warned investors that it could run out of cash due to falling sales, rising operational costs, and a growing debt burden. The Houston-based company, which reported 2024“

Those two companies have unique problems that have contributed to their financial collapse, said Joe Osha, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities. “
But they also suffered from a market environment that is increasingly difficult and uncertain for every firm in the sector, he said.
The reconciliation bill passed by the House of Representatives last month and now being considered in the Senate would abruptly end a tax-credit regime that’s supported households and solar installers for the past 20

## Singling out Sunnova and Mosaic’s challenges
That bill hasn’t been passed yet, however. Osha warned that it’s too early to extrapolate broader implications for the industry at large from these latest bankruptcies.
That’s because both Mosaic and Sunnova have fallen prey not only to challenging business conditions, but to mistakes in how they’ve reacted to the sector’s ongoing woes, he said.
“
But those securities become far less attractive to buyers when the market for residential solar sours — and in the past year it has soured dramatically. Wood Mackenzie reported a 2024

The House bill’s provision that would cut off tax credits for solar leasing does, however, pose a significant threat to Sunrun’s predominant business model of offering leases and power purchase agreements to residences, Osha said.
The House bill would not cancel tax credits for power purchase agreements, the other primary mechanism for companies that offer third-party-owned solar, Osha said. But in his Monday research note, he opined that this exclusion was “

At the same time, thousands of smaller companies that make up the majority of residential solar installations would almost certainly suffer from the tax-credit changes, even if their challenges go less noticed than those of industry stalwarts, said Kristina Costa, former clean energy adviser for the Biden administration.
That would have negative consequences for those working in the industry. Residential solar installation accounted for 20231700022lost their jobs between April 2023

Progressive States would do well to follow France, by mandating solar canopies on ALL existing parking lots larger than 75 spaces within 5 years. Add on-site BESS +Vehicle-2-Grid chargers and you've very rapidly deployed a robust, widely distributed matrix of reliable micro grids generating, storing & re-distributing cheap renewable energy right where most of us live & work. No new utility transmission, interconnection, site acquisition, or other site improvement spending required. But to do this, States would need to replace IRA investment incentives for this purpose now available to wealthy owners of large leased residential & commercial properties with big parking lots. Carrots +Sticks.
This policy would fix the glaring mismatch between the self-interest of wealthy leased property owners and their tenants, who pay the utility bills. The benefits are obvious to all the owners of new health care facilities in my county, like Kaiser & Sutter Healthcare, because they've already covered 80% of their parking with solar canopies. They get it.

An Ohio bill that would establish rules for underground carbon dioxide storage is being shaped behind the scenes by oil and gas companies that stand to benefit from the legislation.
Oil and gas industry groups have been busy for months vetting bill sponsors, drafting legislation, writing talking points for lawmakers, meeting with regulators, and coordinating with other industry stakeholders.
Industry lobbyists often play an active role in pushing for legislation that will favor them. But public records shared with Canary Media by Fieldnotes, a watchdog group that investigates the oil and gas industry, show that the American Petroleum Institute and the Ohio Oil and Gas Association have played an outsize role in shaping the bill.
Supporters say carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS

Tristan Rader (D-Lakewood) said he hasn’t made up his mind about the carbon capture bills but has questions, especially whether the waste will escape from the underground spaces in which it will be stored. Yet he sees an imbalance in power at the legislature, where industry often holds more sway.

It’s over. Well, partly.
As of today, customers of regulated utilities in Ohio will no longer pay subsidies for two old coal plants — but the saga of the coal and nuclear bailout law at the heart of Ohio’s largest public-corruption scandal continues.

While the FirstEnergy case involves massive amounts of money, utility corruption isn’t unique to Ohio, said author Richard Munson, former director of Midwest clean energy for the Environmental Defense Fund. Besides undermining democracy and raising electric bills, corruption interferes with competitive markets, he told Canary Media.
Basically, bailouts for fossil fuels and nuclear power impose a disadvantage on cheaper, clean sources like wind and solar. “

This new fight between the two governors and the feds could play out similarly to the fight between New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and the Trump administration over the Empire Wind project earlier this year. After weeks of developer Equinor threatening to walk away from the halted project due to the high costs of delayed construction, the Trump administration reversed course and lifted the ban, claiming it had struck a deal with Hochul, a Democrat, to allow a natural gas pipeline to be built in the state.

The Trump administration, including U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, has in recent months pushed for New England and in particular Massachusetts to build new gas pipelines.

The great majority of steel and aluminum in the U.S. is made from recycled metal, not raw ore. That’s fortunate, since creating this recycled metal emits much less carbon emissions than forging it from scratch. And that means increasing the amount of metal that can be recycled is one means of decarbonizing the industry.

California’s push to electrify its cars is facing a potentially serious problem: People aren’t buying electric cars fast enough.
After three straight years of strong growth, sales have stabilized in California, raising questions about whether the state will fail to meet its groundbreaking mandate banning sales of gas-powered vehicles.
About a quarter — 2532024252023202013
But the slowed pace of growth in the market puts the state’s climate and air pollution goals at risk. Under California’s mandate, 2026

David Simpson, who owns three car dealerships in Orange County, said he is not seeing increased demand for electric cars. While the initial rollout of some models, such as the GMCEV

Dave Clegern, a spokesperson for the California Air Resources Board, which oversees the electric car mandates, said in an email that while sales of zero-emission vehicles in California are “
Although the rules limit what automakers can sell, Californians are not required to buy electric cars. That means if consumer demand doesn’t increase, it could be a major black eye for Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has made electric cars a cornerstone of his agenda to fight climate change and clean the air. A spokesman for Newsom declined to comment.
The state mandate, however, has some flexibility, Clegern said. First of all, it’s a multi-year formula: Each manufacturer’s sales of 20263520222024
Manufacturers also can buy credits from automakers that have exceeded the target — companies that only sell electric models, such as Tesla or Rivian. To enforce compliance with California’s sales requirements, state officials could impose steep penalties of $20000
“
Brian Maas, president of the California New Car Dealers Association, said automakers could seek to avoid the fines by reducing the number of gas-powered cars they send to California dealers. He said that could leave fewer options for buyers, drive up prices, and push some consumers to Nevada or Arizona to find the car they want, while others will hold on to their older, more polluting vehicles.

The auto industry group Alliance for Automotive Innovation has been raising these concerns since at least December, when it published a memo entitled “EV
Last month, John Bozzella, the group’s chief executive, called California’s rules “

But electric vehicle sales, which make up the majority of zero-emission cars, grew by only 1120243789103746682023600202431192023
The slower growth comes amid overall market sluggishness, with all auto sales in California dipping slightly last year to 1752030
Loren McDonald, chief analyst for the charging app Paren, said a major contributor is a shift in consumer demographics.
The state’s market has moved beyond early electric car adopters — affluent, environmentally motivated buyers willing to overlook challenges like limited charging infrastructure and higher costs — and into the mainstream.
He said these new buyers, often from middle-income households or who live in apartment buildings without easy access to charging, are far less forgiving when it comes to electric cars. Concerns about range, broken chargers, and upfront costs are deal-breakers.
Tesla’s market dominance has exacerbated the issue. Many left-leaning California consumers, who were once loyal to Tesla, appear to have distanced themselves because of CEO

Affordability remains a crucial hurdle, though McDonald sees signs of improvement. Automakers have ramped up production, leading to competitive pricing and aggressive lease deals — many under $400
But mainstream consumers are largely unaware that electric vehicles offer long-term savings in fuel and maintenance, McDonald said, adding that better education is needed to convince consumers to take the leap, especially as electric car prices increasingly approach parity with gas-powered vehicles.

## More progress despite headwinds
While the start of offshore work is a symbolic milestone, Empire Wind’s onshore construction is also ramping up.
Empire Wind’s Monday update email said the roof of the project’s South Brooklyn Marine Terminal facility is nearing completion. According to the notice, excavation is underway at the spot where a future Brooklyn-based substation will connect wind-generated electricity to the city’s grid.
Research to monitor ecosystem impacts from this massive project is also progressing.
In late March, Duke University professor Doug Nowacek told Canary Media that he and his team of researchers were still planning to tag whales in the project’s lease area during the last week of April. The tagging is meant to take place just before pile-driving into the seafloor begins in early May, he explained.

Revolution Wind can officially resume. But unlike the last time President Donald Trump ordered construction on an offshore wind project to pause, relief came through the courts rather than politicking.
A federal judge on Monday ruled in favor of the Danish energy giant Ørsted, whose $62halted last month by the Interior Department without, as the judge put it, any “was lifted by Trump officials in May following one month of heavy lobbying — and
Judge Royce Lamberth, a Reagan-era appointee serving the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, granted a motion for a preliminary injunction sought by Revolution Wind to resume turbine construction while its complaint against the Interior Department works its way through the courts, which could take years. The project is 80“
Monday’s decision marked a victory for Revolution Wind and could have broader legal ramifications for Trump’s ongoing war against offshore wind energy, given that several projects are still tangled up in litigation. And, if the recent ruling is any indication, the Trump administration may have a hard time convincing judges that walking away from already-approved wind farms makes sense.
“
## All eyes on the courts now
Twelve other high-profile lawsuits are actively challenging Biden-era approvals for eight U.S. wind farms, according to the research firm ClearView Energy Partners. Traditionally, the government defends projects it’s already greenlit. Legally, however, it can pick and choose which approvals to stand up for.
For example, three of those projects — New England Wind, SouthCoast Wind, and the Maryland Offshore Wind Project — could soon lose their federal approvals. None of the three have started construction yet, but in the past month, government officials have filed documents in court for each, trying to undo approvals granted by the Biden administration.
“
The latest blow came on Thursday, when government lawyers 141one filed in the U.S. District Court of Maryland the week prior seeking to take back approvals from the Maryland Offshore Wind Project.
Both filings invoke a new legal interpretation of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act that argues that the Interior Department must weigh other ocean activities — like commercial fishing and Coast Guard operations — in an “
The standard interpretation, employed for almost a decade by past administrations and already upheld in a 2024, instructs agencies to take a more balanced approach to evaluating multiple ocean users.
““
Oddly, the Trump administration appears to be defending some wind projects at the center of these legal challenges while trying to tank the three others.
For example, on Sept. 8NJ
Then there is the exceptional case of Virginia. Earlier this month, E&GOP90
Being inconsistent in when and how it deploys new legal interpretations could backfire for the Trump administration.
On Monday, Lamberth told government lawyers that “
## Lawmakers weigh in
Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are clearly frustrated that most of the offshore wind projects in Trump’s crosshairs are in solidly blue states at a moment when they have little power in Congress to fight back. Many Democrats see the courts as the best hope for surmounting the administration’s continued efforts to block the development of wind power, which they view as necessary for meeting growing electricity demand.

The longtime climate hawk discussed new data showing that electricity prices in the U.S. have “
Revolution Wind’s stop-work order had been bleeding its developers of “2a risk to New England’s future grid reliability.
“
For Revolution Wind, Monday’s legal victory may only be temporary — federal officials could appeal the ruling. A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment. A similar but separate lawsuit challenging Revolution Wind’s stop-work order, brought by the attorneys general of Rhode Island and Connecticut, is winding its way through the courts. Last week, the feds requested that this case be transferred to the U.S. District Court in D.C.

For the first time, fossil fuels accounted for less than half of U.S. electricity production across an entire month as clean power generation surged in March.
Last month, fossil gas and coal made up just over 4951
The data point is a striking example of how far the U.S. energy transition has come in recent years.
A decade ago, the U.S. got nearly two-thirds of its power from fossil fuels. But after years of building mostly solar, wind, and batteries, the country has started to close that gap. Just last month solar and wind generation jumped by 37122024fell25
It’s worth noting that this happened at the start of the spring “
There are a few reasons why. Milder temperatures mean people use less energy to heat and cool their homes, so power demand tends to contract. That has historically made shoulder seasons — the fall version runs from September to November — a good time to take fossil-fuel and nuclear power plants offline for maintenance. Meanwhile, 24
But still: The shoulder seasons are always
It’s also notable given the current political hostility toward clean energy in the U.S. — and the federal government’s re-embrace of fossil fuels.
President Donald Trump wants to halt all wind turbine construction. Congressional Republicans are considering cutting Inflation Reduction Act tax credits that incentivize clean energy projects. Trump’s “could drastically slow the battery storage boom. And the president just this week signed a clutch of executive orders aimed at boosting coal, a highly polluting energy source that also happens to be in structural decline because it cannot compete with fossil gas or renewables on cost.
Even in spite of those headwinds, renewables continue to soar to new heights, underscoring the fact that clean energy is no longer a marginal part of the U.S. power system — but a cornerstone that is here to stay.

That was one of many statistics lobbed at North Carolina utility regulators last week as they gathered to grapple with the coming onslaught of data centers, the immense buildings filled with hardware that make our around-the-clock connectivity possible but could strain the state’s electric grid, raise utility bills, and increase pollution.
Over the course of a two-day discussion on how to avoid these downsides, one simple solution came up again and again: Data centers could commit to limiting their electricity consumption slightly for a handful of periods during the year, formalizing the practice of modulating energy use that’s already standard across the industry.
“load flexibility,” Karen Kemerait, the commissioner presiding over the technical conference, said to more than one presenter last week, before pressing them on the concept.
In response to Kemerait, experts from Google and other tech giants, along with North Carolina’s predominant utility, Duke Energy, all voiced degrees of support for the notion.
Yet how and whether regulators move to actualize load flexibility remains unclear. The Utilities Commission isn’t required to take action following its Oct. 1415
That’s part of why Tyler Norris, a former solar developer and a thought leader on load flexibility who presented last week, hopes it will become a choice for data centers if nothing else.
““
Data centers aren’t the only new large customers driving ever-growing electricity demand forecasts in North Carolina, which Duke used to justify a massive new fleet of gas plants in its most recent proposed long-term plan. But the centers are the most voracious consumers by far, accounting for
Not all of these facilities in the pipeline will come to fruition: It’s not uncommon for tech companies to request grid connections in multiple locations before deciding where they’ll actually build. But many will materialize, posing thorny issues for the utility and its regulators.
What if Duke can’t build generation quickly enough to serve the energy-hungry centers? Can the company do so while still zeroing out its carbon pollution, as required by state law? How can regulators assure that tech giants, not residential customers, pay for new power plants and associated upgrades to the grid?
Load flexibility could provide an elegant answer to these vexing questions.
The idea is rooted in a counterintuitive reality: Data centers don’t run at maximum tilt 100EMS
That’s true for a number of reasons, 247
“
Information on data centers’ exact electricity use is scant, and it appears to vary based on type, but research suggests the facilities’ peak consumption is about 80
Yet utility planners typically assume otherwise, categorizing data centers as ““22
In the simplest terms, while Duke might build 12210080
But if prospective data centers were transparent about their electricity-utilization plans and committed to them on paper, utilities could adjust how they anticipate new power capacity — averting the construction of massive amounts of fossil-fuel infrastructure as well as expensive grid improvements.
In September, analytics groups GridLab and Telos Energy published a “995
Similarly, Norris, a Ph.D. student at Duke University — which has no connection to the utility — is the lead author of a 0541
The figure ““
While enlisting data centers to curtail their own energy use is still more theory than practice, that’s slowly starting to change. Pacific Gas and Electric in California, for instance, has
In August, Google announced voluntary flexibility agreements with Indiana Michigan Power and the Tennessee Valley Authority. The following month, the tech giant revealed a similar arrangement with
The company “
The Data Center Coalition is an alliance of Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and dozens of other companies that own, operate, or lease data-center capacity. The coalition listed “
“
Still, the AI
“““
Indeed, though Duke expressed openness to load flexibility last week, the company advised caution for the long term.
““
And while utilities are well-practiced in demand response for large industrial customers, Public Staff, the state-sanctioned customer advocate, voiced worry last week about scaling the same concept to data centers.

Two and a half nines (99.5%) is really low reliability for something like a Google data center; that's almost two full days of downtime per year. I would expect them to be targeting four nines or above. (There's a useful table on
And yes, every small increase in reliability is a major increase in cost and complexity. But when you're looking at something that generates revenue at the scale they do, it's financially incredibly worth it for these companies.
I also wonder about when these flex times kick in. It might be ok if they're highly uncorrelated between data centers (so that the rest of your fleet can absorb the load). But if it's going to kick in at the same time in multiple places due to common factors, that's a hard no.

I'm going full Polyanna here, but is it not possible that, if we get data centers right, such that a lot of load gets added to Duke's service area but with less need for new generation and T&D than currently projected, we could actually see downward pressure on rates?

Fans of hydrogen hail it as a solution to just about any entrenched decarbonization challenge, from heavy transport to steelmaking to on-demand power. But how hydrogen is produced makes a huge difference in its climate impact; seemingly clean sources can actually rack up major carbon emissions for negligible benefit. For now, the clean hydrogen economy remains largely speculative, with hardly any truly clean hydrogen being produced or any real projects using it. Many planned clean hydrogen projects have vanished without a trace, following a short-lived boom fueled by Biden-era support.
In Calistoga, Energy Vault has tapped hydrogen to deal with a very specific set of constraints — delivering energy without local emissions, over multiple days, in a tight footprint — but the cleanliness of that hydrogen is a more complicated issue than public descriptions of the microgrid suggest.
The key players all have a lot riding on the project.

The results of that experiment will take time to analyze. It could unleash a new, replicable model for premium-priced community-level backup power. Or the quirkiness of the design and the murkiness of hydrogen’s supply chain and emissions could make it a quixotic outlier of questionable climate value.
## Compact and cleaner backup power in a fire zone
The Calistoga microgrid poses an answer to the question of how to provide a few days of backup power to a small town in a small space, without worrying too much about cost. The limitations drove the design, which turned out quite unlike anything built thus far.

## Hydrogen trucked in from across the country
The microgrid’s promise as a clean energy breakthrough, of course, hinges on the supply of clean hydrogen, but supply chains are barely getting started. Almost all commercial hydrogen is currently made from methane gas, a fossil fuel, through a procedure called steam methane reforming that sends the carbon dioxide byproduct straight into the atmosphere.
For hydrogen to stake any claim as a climate solution, it needs to be made without massive carbon emissions. That usually involves an alternative production method called electrolysis, which separates hydrogen from water using electricity. But this method can produce even more emissions than the dirty methane version if the electrolyzers are drawing power from the grid rather than dedicated renewable sources like solar and wind (see this previous Canary Media coverage for a detailed account of why that’s the case).
Energy Vault describes the hydrogen it’s using in Calistoga as “
During a tour of the microgrid, Deepesh Goyal, vice president of stationary power at Plug Power, told Canary Media that Plug Power currently supplies hydrogen from its electrolyzer site in Georgia, which runs on grid power. More than half of Georgia’s electricity comes from fossil fuels, so that electrolysis incurs substantial power-plant emissions. Plug Power buys credits for clean energy supply to compensate for this, Goyal said.
To meet the highest federal standard for clean hydrogen, producers need to obtain clean power matched to their consumption on an hourly basis in the areas where they operate. Plug Power did not respond in time for publication to questions clarifying what type of credits it buys. But a spokesperson for Energy Vault told Canary Media that currently there aren’t any facilities that could supply Calistoga with liquid hydrogen from electrolysis powered by time-matched, dedicated clean electricity, and the earliest such facility is targeting completion in 2026
Goyal also said some of Calistoga’s hydrogen comes from an unnamed partner in Las Vegas that uses renewable natural gas (RNGRNGconvoluted calculations of California’s clean fuels bureaucracy. It’s still hydrogen made by splitting methane and releasing carbon dioxide, but it looks good on paper thanks to controversial rules that privilege certain politically connected providers of RNG
!White fuel cell with Plug Power logo and the text ""Green Hydrogen at Work""
Plug Power’s fuel cells hail the arrival of green hydrogen, but their current carbon emissions profile is less clear. (Wendy Becktold)
If someone were to design a climate solution from a blank slate, they probably wouldn’t run electrolyzers on grid power in Georgia in order to load the super-cooled hydrogen onto diesel-powered tankers and haul it more than 2800
““
One incontrovertible fact is that the microgrid doesn’t combust anything onsite, so the operations within the fenceline emit almost no carbon emissions and don’t impact air quality. But it will be hard to gauge the real climate impacts of such a project until a more verifiably clean and geographically localized hydrogen supply chain develops. Several companies have said they will build truly green hydrogen production in the coming years. That task has only grown more difficult with the Trump administration’s efforts to thwart renewables development and vastly curtail clean hydrogen tax credits.
## Will other buyers accept the cost of liquid hydrogen backup?
The other make-or-break variable for hydrogen-backed resilience is how much it costs. Liquid hydrogen is an expensive, specialty fuel only produced by a handful of suppliers in the U.S., and clean liquid hydrogen is even rarer.

Will never understand why every article about hydrogen needs to give FUD about how hydrogen is made when no article about batteries ever gives the same FUD. Batteries are completely dependent on fossil fuels and have a supply chain dominated by a country that burns over 90 exajoules of coal per year to power their economy. Then those battery cells or battery raw materials get shipped on diesel boats to America. Once those batteries arrive on our shores, we call them green as if they were made by magic. If people want to understand the sustainability of batteries, they should be made here. According to battery proponents, even if you smelt metal with coal or use coal to power your electric arc furnace, it's better for global emissions. So make the battery raw materials here. Hydrogen is 100x cleaner than batteries and can be made in America. Batteries have a long way to go in America and can only be made with heavy dependence on fossil fuels. Let's keep the playing field level here. Where is the paragraph about how the batteries in this microgrid were made explaining the critical dependency on coal & diesel fuel?

All batteries — no matter how good or cheap they might be — still need to be charged — by drawing power from the wires of our anemic electric grid — the same grid that now struggles to keep the lights on. To make this possible, we can redo our grid, or we can supplement it throughout with power generators. The power generators can run on diesel fuel or natural gas. Or they can run on hydrogen. If they run on diesel fuel or natural gas, the benefit of having battery cars is defeated. If the power generators run on hydrogen, they will need to be refueled — which means we must put a hydrogen infrastructure in place to do so. But if we are going to have a hydrogen infrastructure to refuel hydrogen generators to charge battery cars, why not also use the same infrastructure to refuel hydrogen cars and trucks to use the hydrogen directly?

Meta, for its part, struck a different type of deal to buy environmental attribute certificates from Electra. This relatively new concept allows the data-center developer to count the emissions reductions associated with a ton of Electra’s iron toward Meta’s own sustainability targets. The certificates won’t apply to the iron that other partners buy, but rather to a separate batch, Electra said.

But when Robinson and his allies were first laying their plans, the prospects for assistance from the federal government were far rosier than they are today.
The bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act — both signed into law by former President Joe Biden — promised aid for clean energy and for historically disadvantaged communities.
Federal programs spurred by these laws could have potentially funded a replacement of the town’s dilapidated and outdated grid. Tax credits might have offset at least 40

Massachusetts regulators are considering a plan to make heat pumps an obvious financial choice for most residents.
The state Department of Public Utilities is mulling a proposal to heavily discount electricity rates in the winter months for households with heat pumps, a move that could cut energy bills for more than 80
Massachusetts utilities already plan to lower prices for heat pump users starting this winter, but the proposal under consideration would mandate even deeper discounts in future years. The new rates could accelerate the adoption of heat pumps in Massachusetts and boost progress toward the state’s climate goals, proponents say.
And with President Donald Trump’s megabill eliminating federal tax credits at the end of this year for homeowners who install heat pumps, the approach is a timely demonstration of how states can drive heat pump adoption in the absence of federal support.
““
In Massachusetts and other states with ambitious climate goals, transitioning residents from fossil-fueled heating to heat pumps — which can both warm and cool buildings — is a major strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the cost of buying and operating a heat pump has held back widespread adoption, particularly in areas like New England, where cold winters and high electricity prices collide.
“
Today, nearly 80900002021202450000020202030
That, say climate advocates, is where seasonal heat pump rates come in.
## Making heat pump operation affordable
Under current default electric rates, roughly three in four Massachusetts homes switching from natural-gas heating to heat pumps would 301000
“
Massachusetts has already taken steps to start closing that gap with discounted electricity prices for homes using heat pumps. Regulators approved the lower rates proposed by two of the state’s investor-owned electric utilities, Unitil and National Grid, in June 20242025
The planned discounts range from 47
If Eversource’s rates are approved, Massachusetts will become the first state in which all investor-owned utilities offer a seasonal rate specifically for heat pumps, Sachs said. Other states have seasonal rates that also include electric resistance heating, or have individual utilities or municipal power companies that offer heat pump rates, she said.
Still, the state Department of Energy Resources, along with lots of climate advocates, doesn’t think the current plans go far enough. In January, the energy department filed a petition asking utility regulators to consider requiring even further discounts, as recommended by the state Interagency Rates Working Group, a collaborative effort of Massachusetts agencies that examines ways to modify rate design to accelerate decarbonization.
The discounts suggested in the filing range from 121782687301000
“
Some 20
## How do seasonal heat pump rates work?
Supporters of seasonal heat pump rates stress that the lower prices do not mean that heat pump users are being subsidized by everyone else. In fact, they say, the proposed rate structure is far more fair than the status quo.
““
Here’s why: The delivery portion of an electricity bill pays for the construction and upkeep of the poles, wires, and other infrastructure needed to get power where it’s going. To determine how much to charge customers — and this is a bit of a simplification — the utility divides the total cost by the number of kilowatt-hours it expects customers to use. That number becomes the delivery rate.
However, the delivery infrastructure is built to accommodate the demand peaks that happen on the hottest days of summer, when millions of air conditioners turn on at once. In the winter, peak demand is only about 80
““
The idea is that utilities won’t end up taking a financial hit, because the heat pumps use more electricity at this lower rate, keeping revenue steady. Individual consumers, however, save money by eliminating their need for pricier fossil fuels or by switching from costly electric resistance heating to efficient heat pumps.
However, seasonal heat pump rates are only a short-term solution. The logic supporting them only holds as long as the system peak occurs in the summer. Within about 10ISO

My main reason for not getting a heat pump is. I was quoted by 4 different companies. Anywhere from 15000 to 28000 now that seems to be a huge gap and Massachusetts should regulate it. If the house needs 2 heat pumps, for example, it should be X amount of dollars. If it needs three x amount of dollars, if it needs four x amount of dollars, but be consistently the same not for example, I was quoted seventeen thousand for 4 heat pumps buy one company and then another company told me twenty eight thousand now, if there is no regulation by massachusetts. This is why most people aren't getting them because they're afraid of getting scammed as am I? So if you guys want to regulate it, I bet you, you guys would get people to do it. And if you offered incentive 4 landlords to do it, I bet you, it would be done more efficiently as well. And more people would do it just my two cents.

You're right that the unpredictability is big problem! If you're in Boston, there's a group called Laminar Collective that does bulk-purchasing of heat pump to solve exactly this problem.

Heat Pumps do not work well in temperatures below 35 degrees. I know first hand because my son and his wife took advantage of the MA Save rebate and had one installed. It only works well between 40 degrees to 90 degrees. If it's below 40 degrees they rely on the original gas fired baseboard heat and if it's too hot they need to use a large 12k BTU window AC. There are going to be many angry home owners We live in a location where it can get extremely hot and humid and extremely cold. We need energy diversification... We can not solely rely on electricity for heating and cooling.

I'll believe it when I see it! $700 - $1000 in savings? Saving on what, electric bills? Sure, if your using electricity to heat your house. I can go all winter and then some on 2 tanks of oil. At $2.75 /gal x (2 x 250 gal) = $1375 I spend about $900 per year on electricity which includes a week or two of window AC, dehumidifier in the basement and an electric range.

This is good news...I have had a heat pump system for a few years and welcome the effort to make if more economical. I hope it drives more widespread adoption. I would say that some attention should be paid to cushioning the blow for the companies that provide oil for heating as heat pump adoption will hurt their business.

To Jerry: Today's heat pump systems operate at a much lower temperature. I have a Bosch (one of the better manufacturers), and it works down to -15 below zero. The 40 degree temp you stated is a very old # (or they got a unit from a very poor mfgr). It's hard to get a unit that poor in today's market. I was able to get off of oil (and it's unpredictable pricing from year to year), and delivery to the house nature of oil. Then I got solar, and have negative electric bills in the summer, and those credits build up to eliminate or reduce the electric bills in the winter when the sun is lower in the sky. Just my thoughts!

Supporters of a major clean energy bill that fell short in the final days of Illinois’ legislative session are licking their wounds and trying to figure out what went wrong — and what comes next.
Solar and battery companies, clean energy groups, and consumer advocates just months ago had high hopes for the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, which would have created a bonanza of state incentives for energy storage and other grid investments, building on the success of 20172021
The legislation failed to pass as the legislature wrapped up at the end of May.

## What would more batteries mean for customers’ wallets?
Cost concerns appeared to be the main reason that some powerful groups opposed the bill and that legislators didn’t embrace it. Utility customers would have picked up the tab for incentives paid to storage developers, which spooked some large industrial consumers and the labor unions representing their workers, according to people involved in the bill negotiations.
Groups that
But investing in battery storage should actually lower energy bills, according to bill proponents, since it could be cheaper for utilities to develop storage than to supplement their power supply with pricey energy from regional markets.
Now proponents wonder whether expected energy-price spikes this summer could ironically persuade lawmakers to revisit the storage plan. Prices are expected to 10
An analysis by the Illinois Power Agency, which procures power on behalf of ComEd and Ameren, found that customers would pay less for electricity under the legislation. By 203520850

This time around, there is no incentive for nuclear on the table; nor is the industry seeking one since increased electricity demand — including from data centers — has boosted the fortunes of the state’s once-financially-ailing nuclear plants.

## Virtual power plants and BYONCE
Along with installing large-scale batteries on the grid, the legislation would have created a “virtual power plant” program, allowing the networking of batteries scattered across homes and businesses that could be called on to provide power to the grid in times of high demand. The bill would have also created incentives to help low-income people get batteries in combination with solar arrays, potentially allowing them to earn revenue from a virtual power plant program.

Once the federal budget passes, expected cuts to clean energy could also help motivate state leaders to enact legislation to fill the gap, advocates said.

Comparing this with other failures shows that it is hard to sell people on potential savings but easy to make them worry about cost - even when savings are realistic and clearly cover the cost. Then again, who knows if all parties in the negotiations acted in good faith.

For Brito, this sort of collaboration is key to the success of port electrification.
“
For example, work at Cleveland’s Warehouse A necessitates collaborating with Cleveland Public Power, the city’s municipal utility. While solar panels and battery storage at the warehouse will eventually provide much of the port’s electricity needs, it still requires more grid power in order to fully electrify.
Other phases of the work will add cabling and connections for vessels to operate with electric power while they’re in port. That “

Coordination with other stakeholders also presents challenges for the Detroit/​Wayne County Port Authority. “
Instead, most cargo carried by boats and ships moves through private docks in industrial port areas around the city. “
But companies may not want to take some steps on an individual basis, such as constructing and installing power lines and charging equipment at privately owned docks that would only be used part-time.
So the Detroit/​Wayne County Port Authority is exploring alternatives, such as how hydrogen could produce clean electricity aboard a boat that could then act as a mobile plug-in port for docked vessels’ shore power.
Developing shore power calls for even more groups working together on a broader scale. “
Without standards set at the regional and national level, states and cities that try to compel changes on their own could see shippers simply move to other ports with more lax rules, Schrupp said. While some firms looking to slash their supply-chain emissions might prefer to work with a port that is decarbonizing operations, others might avoid areas that could restrict their diesel use.

Earlier this week, two low-carbon cement startups unveiled new partnerships with data-center developers and operators, which are looking at ways to curb the tech sector’s ballooning climate impact.
The separate announcements from Sublime Systems and Brimstone are a striking example of how businesses are pressing ahead with efforts to decarbonize essential polluting industries like cement making — even as the Trump administration guts federal programs meant to kick-start U.S. manufacturing of cleaner construction materials.
Both companies are developing novel ways of producing cement that don’t cook the planet in the process. Cement — the gluey powder mixed with sand, gravel, and water to form concrete — is responsible for roughly 8

The announcements send an important signal that private-sector demand isn’t waning for cleaner construction products — despite the White House abandoning strategies and rescinding funding for using greener cement, steel, glass, and other materials in public buildings, roads, and bridges.

Eastern Washington seems like a good location for Sublime's megaton-scale plant, with surficial basalt, water transportation upstream of Portland and other major ports, and abundant clean energy just over the mountains from Microsoft's campus. Washington State also has supportive state laws that welcome and encourage this kind of innovation.

An Indiana utility has come up with an unusual plan for meeting growing power demand from data centers.
Northern Indiana Public Service Co. is launching a spinoff company, GenCo, that is exempt from many of the regulatory proceedings typically required before power plants can be built in the state. The utility, also known as NIPSCO
But the move is raising alarm bells for watchdog groups and other critics, who argue that rather than protect consumers, the plan will mainly enrich the utility’s parent company while interfering with market competition and undercutting important regulatory safeguards. It could also set back the state’s clean-energy transition, advocates say.
As regulators around the country wrestle with how to get a lot of power online quickly to serve “AINIPSCO““
## Beating other states in the data-center race
Indiana is attractive to huge data centers because of its cheap land, ample water, PJM2035
NIPSCOCEONIPSCO“
But it’s a competitive business, with other states and municipalities courting the same data centers. NIPSCO
The regulatory commission agreed with this reasoning, writing in its September order approving the GenCo plan, ““NIPSCO
## Will GenCo help or hurt Indiana households?
Nationwide, regulators and advocates have grappled with concerns that residential customers could pick up too much of the tab for new generation built to power data centers, especially if the computing warehouses don’t materialize or don’t use as much power as predicted.
NIPSCONIPSCO
But Citizens Action Coalition, the state’s main consumer-advocacy group, argues that the GenCo structure doesn’t really insulate customers from the risks of the data-center market.
If GenCo were to lose money, that could affect the finances and credit rating of parent company NiSource and hence impact NIPSCO
In September, the state regulatory commission exempted GenCo from a host of usual procedures. Chief among them is that GenCo does not have to file a detailed plan when it wants to build or acquire new generation. The commission did not set any minimum standards or requirements regarding how power will be provided to data centers, as advocates had hoped. Instead, the commission will review each proposed contract between NIPSCONIPSCO
The Citizens Action Coalition called this case-by-case review process unfair and inefficient, making it too difficult for stakeholders to monitor the situation and submit public comments to the commission.
““
NIPSCOCEO
“
The Citizens Action Coalition and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, a state agency tasked with protecting consumers, notified the commission that they plan to appeal the approval of GenCo.
## Concerns about a market edge
Another major concern of critics is that GenCo will have an unfair competitive advantage over other power producers.
Indiana has a regulated energy market, wherein utilities have the right to serve as monopoly producers and distributors of energy, but regulators must approve how much capacity they build or buy and what they charge customers for the power.
GenCo is largely exempt from this structure, acting more akin to a power producer in a state like Illinois, with a deregulated market. But in Illinois, power producers compete to sell their energy to utilities, whereas GenCo has a guaranteed customer in the form of NIPSCONIPSCO
““
The Clean Grid Alliance — made up of renewable-energy developers, environmental groups, and other stakeholders — and Takanock, a data-center developer, told regulators in a joint brief that GenCo “and only GenCoNIPSCO
In testimony, Takanock founder and CEONIPSCO“NIPSCONIPSCO“
Davies and other stakeholders say there are ways for NIPSCO
Takanock and the Clean Grid Alliance, in their filing, criticize GenCo for failing to explore the more common method of pricing tariffs designed specifically for data centers. That’s where a utility makes an agreement with state regulators to treat data centers differently from other customers, ensuring they pay their fair share of costs. Davies described Wyoming regulators’ creation of such a special tariff to serve a Microsoft data center. Davies was Microsoft’s director of renewable-energy strategy and research at the time.
In another example, Citizens Action Coalition
Advocates point out that Indiana already has a law on the books meant to help utilities more quickly get power online to supply data centers, without sacrificing transparency or relying on a new entity like GenCo. grid-enhancing tech to avoid investments in new power plants, among other things.

Zero Emissions Northwest is just one of many entities thrown into chaos by the Trump administration’s unprecedented freeze of hundreds of billions of dollars of congressionally mandated climate and energy spending. Hundreds of nonprofits, governments, and businesses have received funding under the Inflation Reduction Act and infrastructure-law programs over the last three years.
Most of that funding has already been obligated, or legally committed under contract, meaning recipients like the rural businesses Funk’s organization helps felt confident spending money and making long-term investment plans based on the belief — now very much in doubt — that the federal government would honor its commitments.
Last week, legal challenges yielded a series of federal court decisions that ordered temporary halts to the administration’s funding freezes, which have gone far beyond climate and clean energy. But even after two court directives to restart spending, it remains unclear whether federal agencies are actually complying — and how deep the damage already is for grantees like Zero Emissions Northwest.

It’s likely that these legal challenges to Trump administration efforts to withhold spending authorized by Congress will quickly reach the U.S. Supreme Court, legal experts say.

A surge of housing development in a Boston suburb is providing evidence that natural-gas bans and strict energy-efficiency standards do not slow new construction or make it more expensive. Indeed, these guidelines can even boost the growth of affordable housing, say local advocates.

Detractors, however, have consistently argued that requiring or even heavily encouraging all-electric construction would make housing more costly and difficult to build at a time when Massachusetts is facing an acute housing shortage. In 2022“
Similar battles have played out across the country, from California to New York.
There is plenty of evidence that electrified, highly efficient homes don’t need to come with a price premium.

## A sustainable housing surge in Lexington
After Lexington changed its zoning rules in 20233122100
The new construction will include both rental units and condos available to purchase that will, in total, increase available housing in town by 99150002025
However, most of the construction driven by the new zoning is required to make 1540200
The municipal project will include four residential buildings designed to be energy-efficient and to minimize the square footage of halls and other common areas, which will reduce the cost of heating and cooling these spaces. Solar panels on the roofs will offset the electricity consumed by the building’s heat pumps, said Dave Traggorth, principal with Causeway Development, the company chosen to develop the property.
““
All of these new projects — market-rate and affordable — will be prohibited from using fossil fuels to run furnaces or other appliances because of the town’s requirement that new construction be fully electric.
The town has also adopted an optional, more rigorous version of the state building code that requires new, multifamily projects over 12000
“
While Lexington is a particularly active town, the other nine communities that have banned fossil fuels in new construction have all reported that the rules have posed no obstacle to development, Cunningham said. Restrictive zoning and antidevelopment sentiment among residents are much more pressing problems, she said.
For the eventual residents, the benefits go beyond the knowledge that their homes are helping cut emissions. Homes designed to passive house standards use far less energy than those that are conventionally built, creating ongoing savings for homeowners and tenants, and have been found to generally have better indoor air quality. When the power goes out, these well-sealed buildings can keep interior temperatures comfortable for days.
## Paving the way for electrification
It is no accident that residential developers were ready to jump when opportunities opened up in a town with stringent efficiency and electrification rules. Massachusetts has been laying the groundwork for years, said Lauren Baumann, director of sustainability and climate initiatives for the Massachusetts Housing Partnership, a nonprofit that works to expand affordable housing.
“
In 2019awarded $173 to eight affordable, multifamily projects to help accelerate the adoption of passive house standards in multifamily construction by demonstrating that the approach makes financial sense. That same year, the state’s energy-efficiency program administrator, Mass Save, launched an initiative offering money to multifamily projects for feasibility studies, energy modeling, and analyses of post-construction energy performance.
These incentives gave architects and contractors a lower-risk way to become familiar with a new approach to building. And familiarity, in this case, bred knowledge, skills, and enthusiasm.
““
Traggorth has seen this evolution in his work. Five years ago, he said, if he approached a contractor to discuss building to passive house standards, he was often greeted with confusion. Now, ““

But wait...there's more.
Lexington is a participant in Massachusetts' Community Electricity Aggregation program. Lexington electricity users have a choice of three options - the standard option (with the mandated state minimum 27% class 1 RPS), a 100% green renewable option and a 100% New England Green with all electricity supplied by new regional renewable resources. The program provides level electricity supply costs over a three-year term, after which the community goes out to bid again.
The regional utility (Eversource) supplies electricity at rates that change twice per year. The Eversource default supply rate for the next six months is 1/10 of a cent higher per kWh than Lexington's current 100% green rate. (14.884 cents/kWh vs. 14.773 cents/kWh). [In the interest of full disclosure, the Eversource Aug-Feb rates are typically several cents/kWh higher than the Feb-Aug rates, but still...]
There's still more - these new Lexington residences will almost certainly qualify for the recently DPU-approved winter heat pump rates. Those rates provide savings on the electricity delivery charges.

You're correct that the single largest source of electricity is currently generated from natural gas. However, the electricity generated from a natural gas plant is lower in net carbon emissions than the same amount of gas burned directly in the home. There are significant scale efficiencies.
Moreover, gas burned within the home creates particulates which aren't great for respiratory health (this is why you should always use a vent over a gas stove).
Lastly, it's significantly easier to built new construction with an electric only supply and then transition the net supply of power towards lower-carbon options than to do things the other way around - building gas hookups as a short/medium term solution and then having to demolish them is wasteful.

Concerning ""However, the electricity generated from a natural gas plant is lower in net carbon emissions than the same amount of gas burned directly in the home. There are significant scale efficiencies."" This may be theoretically true, but many followers believe the answer is: It depends.
For example, net carbon emissions from gas-fired plants vary wildly as determined by the generation technology used, for example, single fired vs. combined-cycle generation and whether carbon-capture technologies are employed. You're probably aware that 5% - 10% of plant-generated electricity is lost in transmission.
Home heating with gas can be more or less efficient depending, again, on the technologies employed. Yes, venting has to be implemented.
I'm all in with respect to home heating with electricity, recognizing that this will probably require nuclear as the primary generation source. In the interim, clean-burning natural gas is the best solution.

Such dual-fuel construction has historically been the norm in California, but all-electric construction avoids the added time and cost of hooking up gas infrastructure. That often requires property owners to submit a separate service request to the gas utility; install gas meters, pipes, and ductwork; and coordinate gas safety checks, according to the authors.
The team expects all-electric rebuilds to not only deliver better indoor air quality for occupants but to be easier on people’s wallets. Their report cites a 2019UCLA
All-electric new homes in California that skip gas-burning appliances for much more efficient electric heat-pump heaters and ACs, water heaters, and clothes dryers, as well as induction stoves, are also likely to slash energy bills, per the report. An April analysis by climate think tank RMILA
Kosmala-Dahlbeck points out that people going the all-electric route now will be able to avoid costly and complex retrofits in the future.

In the near future, installing a new gas appliance when the old one conks out could be less of an option. Air regulators for the state are 2030LApoised to adopt rules that would discourage new installations of these polluting appliances as soon as 2027
The report authors recommend that policymakers — including city council members, county supervisors, the mayor’s office, and state legislators and agencies — support an all-electric recovery.

Maybe in southern California, where there is little if any heating demand, but not everywhere. One of the major sources of Texas' winter grid vulnerability is Texas has too many poorly insulated homes and apartments that use resistant (electricity) heat which is very inefficient. An 800 sq. ft apartment at 15 degrees, uses the same electricity as a 2,500 sq. ft. house uses at 100 degrees. Texas should pass legislation that no future residential use electric heat.

Interesting. While one system is inherently simpler than two, I'm having a hard time buying into the savings claimed for using electric over gas. I'm a fan of heat pumps which are very efficient, but with electric in CA costing 2.5x - 3.5x what most folks in the US pay for electric, I would think those heat pumps would have to be several times more efficient than gas, not the moderately more efficient that is normally what we all read. $.40 - $.50 per Kw is just crazy. Here in FL, our electric definitely averages less than $.15/kw.
I'd love to know what electric rate they used to conclude about the savings. I wouldn't be surprised if they chose to use the national average, around $.14 but that's 1/3 of what most Californian's are averaging.
The electric in our condo peaks out at about $250 a month with the air conditioning running in the summer where the average day time highs are in the 90s and the average lows in the 70s. The air conditioners don't get much of a break. I'd be looking at $700+ a month if I was still living with CA electric rates.
The bright spot in CA's efforts seems to be the dramatic expansion of Grid level battery usage, especially with the CA rooftop solar market collapsing since solar owners no longer get big payouts for electric they ship to the grid. .
Still when it comes to grid batteries, CA is now apparently not terribly behind Texas in that regard.

heat pumps provide roughly 400 times the heat from a single unit of energy than gas does, so it is silly to claim that electric heating will cost more or will be less efficient - nobody is suggesting resistant heat, ever:
induction is also many times more efficient than gas stovetops, using magnets to heat pans, not combusted gas to heat mostly the air around the outside of the pan (while poisoning everyone living there), and it's faster, cleaner and far more accurate.
rooftop solar + energy storage + Passiv Haus building codes + islanding microgrids + electric transportation = 21st century. anything else is wasteful, poisonous, anti-democratic and overpriced.

Let's totally waste a crisis and rebuild with gas to perpetuate the disaster.
This reminds me a lot of motonormativity. We pretend that we’re trying to emphasize safety over speed and convenience. But of course we don’t do that. We give a safety pass to cars even though we know how much harm they cause. In the case of natural gas in new buildings, we know the dangers and the extra expense of adding this second energy source, but we give it a pass. how many times can we completely waste a crisis? There has never been an easier, cheaper more appropriate time to switch a large swath of the population away from gas.
“We’ve seen repeatedly that retrofitting later down the line is more expensive than constructing all-electric to begin with,” gosh, ya think?
The idea of losing one’s home to a fire is tough to fathom. Perhaps the only silver lining would be to start from scratch and do things correctly with all that we’ve learned and all that is available now since the home was built.

I am glad someone has written about the office at the Department of Energy I was part of until this April when I took an early retirement after seeing that all of our efforts would be destroyed by Trump. The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations was the pinochle of my 30 years working in the Federal government and its mission and goals were ambitious and necessary. I started in 2022 and was number 35 in the hiring process. In January of this year we were at 331. The recent articles in the New York Times on China's growth in clean energy projects in chilling as the US will be so damaged by what Trump has done. Our energy needs cannot keep up with the AI data centers, climate change, and the lack of infrastructure and renewable energy. It was sad to read but truthful.

Data centers could help slash costs and grid-upgrade times by easing off of utility grids during peak hours and finding ways to provide their own power.

(Binh Nguyen)
This is the fourth and final article in our series ​“ _Boon or bane: What will data centers do to the grid?”_
Tom Wilson is aware that the explosive growth of data centers could make electricity costlier and dirtier. As a principal technical executive at the Electric Power Research Institute, the premier U.S. utility research organization, he’s studied the risks himself.
But he also thinks conversations about the problem tend to miss a key point. Data centers could also make the grid cleaner and cheaper by embracing a simple concept: flexibility.
““
DCFlex is short for “
Since its October launch, DCFlex has grown from 1537“QTSAI
On the grid side are utilities such as Duke Energy, Pacific Gas &NRG
The range of participants reflects the broad interest in solving the pressing challenge of powering the data centers being proposed around the country without driving up grid costs and emissions.
That won’t be easy. From Virginia’s “utilities are being inundated with demands for round-the-clock power from data center projects that can add the equivalent of a small city’s electricity consumption within a few years. Meanwhile, it usually takes four or five years to connect new power plants to the grid.
Flexibility could make a big difference, however, said Tom Wilson, who’s worked on climate and energy issues for more than four decades, including advising projects at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University and serving at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy during the Biden administration.
That’s because the impacts of massive new utility customers like data centers are tied not just to how much power they need but specifically to when
## Why flexibility matters
Utilities live and die by the few hours per year when demand for electricity peaks — usually during the hottest and coldest days. By refraining from using grid power during those peak hours, new data centers could significantly reduce their impact on utility costs and carbon emissions.
If data centers and other big electricity customers committed to curtailing their power use during peak hours, it could unlock tens of gigawatts of “&
Realizing that spare capacity will be challenging, though. For starters, every new large power customer would have to agree not to use grid power during key hours of the year, which is far from a realistic expectation today. What’s more, utilities would need some serious proof that those big customers can actually follow through with promises to not use power during those peak times before letting them connect, because broken promises in this case could lead to overloaded grids or forced blackouts.
And flexibility can’t solve all the power problems that massive data center expansion could cause.
In a driving an unprecedented fivefold increase in the amount of new power demand that U.S. utilities and grid operators forecast over the next half decade or so. While that analysis ““
Still, for utilities struggling to plan and build the generation and grid infrastructure needed to support data centers, flexibility is worth exploring. That’s because data centers could make their operations flexible a lot faster than utilities can expand power grids and build power plants.
It typically takes seven to 10“just starting to take hold in utility planning, but it could play a major role in managing the surge in power demand.
Flexible data centers may also be able to secure space on capacity-constrained grids more quickly than inflexible competitors, Tom Wilson said. A “35015
“
That’s not lost on Brian Janous, cofounder of “
“‘‘“
In fact, 240
Janous thinks many utilities are eager for similar propositions today. One unnamed utility executive told him recently that the backlog for connecting large data centers to its grid is now at least five years. “‘‘
## The role of on-site generation
Getting utilities and data centers together to ask those kinds of questions is what DCFlex is all about. Project partners are now developing five to 10“
As for how these projects will help the grid, he laid out two broad methods: They’ll use on-site power generation or storage to replace what they’d otherwise pull from the grid, or they’ll use less electricity during peak hours.
Janous thinks on-site generation is the simpler approach. To some extent, it’s already happening today but typically with dirty diesel generators. Janous, Tom Wilson, and other experts say these diesel generators are not a viable option for hyperscalers, however. They’re simply too dirty and too expensive to rely on, except during grid outages or other dire situations.
Biodiesel and renewable diesel could work for some smaller data centers, Tom Wilson said. But it’s not yet clear whether air-quality rules would permit generators burning those fuels to run during nonemergencies. Nor are the economics viable for larger-scale data centers, he said.
Fossil-gas-fired backup generators like those Microsoft used in Cheyenne are another option — albeit one that still pollutes the local air and warms the planet. Still, a growing number of data center developers are looking to use them as a workaround to grid constraints. ““
It would be a problem for the planet — and for meeting the climate goals major tech companies have committed to — if data centers planned to use fossil gas for a majority of their power. But if relied on sparingly and strategically, this choice might be less harmful than the alternatives: If a data center burns fossil gas just to power itself during grid peaks, that might reduce pressure on utilities to keep old coal-fired power plants open or to build much larger gas-fired plants that would lock in emissions for decades.
Other gas-fueled options for on-site power might be less damaging to the climate — although this remains a hotly debated topic. Microgrid developer “
And utility American Electric Power has signed an agreement to
Batteries are another option — and the one that has the greatest potential to be clean. Most data centers have some batteries on-site to help computers ride through grid disruptions until backup generators can turn on, but relying on batteries for backup power and to provide grid support is a far more complex and costly endeavor.
““
A small but growing number of hyperscalers are looking to batteries for both backup power and grid flexibility.
“
In the U.S., a Department of Energy grant is supporting a battery installation at an
It’s one of a number of DOE“DOE
## Why can’t data centers use less power to help the grid?
The other big idea for making data centers flexible focuses not on the power they can generate and store but on the power they use, Shultz said.
“
Historically, data centers
But if a data center’s participation in a demand-response program is the difference between it getting a grid connection or not, the programs become a lot more appealing.
Shultz highlighted two key data center tasks that are particularly ripe for load flexibility.
The first is “
Data center operators have invested heavily to make this cooling and power conversion more efficient in recent decades. Further advances in efficiency — and technologies that can store power for cooling for later use — could become “
The second big target for load flexibility is “24“
Again, this isn’t a new idea. Cryptocurrency mining operations in Texas have been earning “
““
But ““
Plus, not every data center conducts tasks that can be easily postponed, Tom Wilson emphasized. “80000‘
Other tasks are better suited, he said, including, critically, much of the work of training the AI“
Taking advantage of that flexibility is the idea behind ““
Not every ““AI
Verrus hasn’t built one of these data centers yet, but it is targeting Arizona, California, and Massachusetts as its first markets. In a “
## Finding the middle ground on flexibility
It’s not clear how many data center developers are building flexibility into their grid interconnection requests to utilities. But that doesn’t mean it’s not happening.
Data center developers tend to be secretive about their hunt for sites and the nature of the discussions they have with utilities. Developers may be talking about flexibility with one utility while also shopping around for a more traditional interconnection that gives them access to the power they want at all hours of the day.
Flexibility deals are most likely to emerge in data center markets where unimpeded interconnections simply aren’t possible anymore due to grid constraints, said Aaron Bilyeu, Cloverleaf’s chief development officer. What’s changed is that “
Utilities in grid-constrained parts of the country are beginning to take on the complexities of creating “ — the rules and rates for customers — that could provide data center developers some clarity on what a commitment to flexible operations could be worth to them. That’s a big part of the work underway at DCFlex, Tom Wilson said.
“RTO“
““
That work will be critical to giving regulators the tools they need to challenge utilities’ claims that they must build new fossil-gas power plants and keep coal plants open to serve peak loads, the Sierra Club wrote in a “
That aligns with the needs of tech companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft that have aggressive clean energy goals. These companies are negotiating with utilities in hot data center markets like Georgia, arguing that letting data centers build clean energy, on-site power, and load flexibility into load forecasts could obviate some of the new dirty power that utility Georgia Power wants to build.
Putting the question of clean versus dirty power aside, data center developers can’t expect utilities and regulators to allow the costs of supplying them with round-the-clock power to fall on regular customers’ shoulders, Bilyeu said. “

In California, the solar-canal system was built in two phases, with a 20110
Proponents of this emerging approach say it can provide overlapping benefits.
Early research suggests that, along with producing power in land-constrained areas, putting solar arrays above water can help keep panels cool, in turn improving their efficiency and electricity output. Shade from the panels can also prevent water loss through evaporation in drought-prone regions and can limit algae growth in waterways.
Plus, solar canals could offer a faster path to clean energy development than utility-scale solar farms, especially in rural parts of the U.S. where big renewables projects increasingly face community opposition. Placing solar panels atop existing infrastructure doesn’t require altering the landscape, and the relatively small installations can be plugged into nearby distribution lines, avoiding the cumbersome process of connecting to the higher-voltage wires required for bigger undertakings.

The purpose of these early arrays is primarily to power on-site canal equipment like pumps and gates. But such projects could eventually help clean up the larger grid, too. A coalition of U.S. environmental groups previously estimated that putting panels over 80002520
Still, the technology isn’t an obvious choice for many canal operators.
Elevating solar panels over canals is more expensive and technically complex than installing conventional ground-mounted solar arrays on trackers, and it can involve using more concrete and steel. Wider canals may also require support structures for panels within the waterway, which can disrupt the flow of water.

What does wide mean in your article. 20 ft wide vs 120 ft wide. Makes a very strange canal. Please be accountable in your description and choice of words. As width and length have different meaning. Perhaps this is just a context issue. In how wide is the canal vs how long did the solar panels cover. Either way I am left confused as you are not being very effective with your description.

I think they meant long, a 120ft wide canal would be huge, that's on the scale of commercial shipping canals

Canopy structures for these projects obviously cost more than typical ground mounting systems. But they'll last for 75+years with minimal maintenance. That's 3 generations of improving solar panel technology. And all the conduit & most of the wiring will last for over 50 years as well. This also applies to solar parking lot micro grid canopies. These are long-term property improvement assets. The solar panels are different; they'll be easily replaced &recycled in 25 years.

Why disturb land that has sacred value when we could just put the solar panels over a typical big hot (sub)urban parking lot and generate efficient power for a widely distributed matrix of community micro grids. Right where most utility rate payers live, work &commute from large apartments. condos & single family neighborhoods to shopping centers, business parks & various municipal facilities, like hospitals & community colleges. No new utility transmission, site acquisition or other site improvement spending required. No permitting or interconnection delays or armies of litigious NIMBYS. The benefits are so obvious that all the new healthcare facilities in my county have already shaded 80% of their big parking lots with solar canopies +on-site BESS +EV chargers. Mundane solar abundance! They're already getting it!

New technology allows for solar panels to be printed out onto fabric. While those are nowhere near as efficient as traditional panels, the infrastructure require to hold them would be a fraction of the cost. One would hope with all the academic research going into this that they have explored that option. The impending decommissioning of the Ivanpah Solar Electric plant in CA should give them pause before they commit too heavily to current technology.

!Sheep next to solar panels in a field
Sheep graze among solar panels in Illinois. (Pivot Energy)
To all the challenges the solar industry is facing today, add one more: cultivating a domestic market for lamb meat. It may seem an unlikely mission for clean-energy developers, but in many states, including Illinois, grazing sheep between rows of photovoltaic panels is considered the most efficient form of agrivoltaics — the combination of solar and farming on the same land.
Solar advocates, researchers, and developers have given much attention to agrivoltaics. The practice includes growing crops like blueberries, tomatoes, or peppers in the shade of solar panels and letting cows or sheep graze around the arrays.
Perhaps the biggest benefit of agrivoltaics is that land is not being taken out of agricultural production in favor of clean energy, a concern that has stoked intense opposition to solar. The Trump administration codified this sentiment when the head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 19“
Illinois’ sprawling fields of corn and soybeans don’t coexist well with solar panels, but sheep do, making grazing a promising type of agrivoltaics for the state, proponents say.
In a typical solar grazing arrangement, sheep farmers (called grazers) are paid by solar developers to bring the animals to sites hosting large arrays — often farms — where they munch away on the vegetation. Meanwhile, the landowner benefits from lease payments. Grazing is a lower-emissions alternative to mechanical mowing, and sheep can reach corners that mowers can’t.
But to make a living herding sheep, the grazers need to be able to sell the lambs they raise as meat. In the U.S., lamb is sold primarily in halal markets and appears on menus only during Easter holidays.
““
## A taste for lamb
Brooke Watson would like to see demand for lamb soar in the Midwest, in tandem with demand for solar grazing. Brooke’s husband, Chauncey Watson IV4, a program that teaches kids about agriculture. Chauncey’s family has farmed in Illinois since 18562023““500320
Brooke laments that Americans “II

Brooke said solar grazing can also provide a way for younger farmers to stay in the business.

## A novelty in Illinois
According to a 20246200087000109130007000148
Texas and California have long histories of shepherding, and in many areas sheep are central to the ranching culture. That means grazing sheep under solar panels is continuing these areas’ traditional agriculture.
But in Illinois, there is little history of raising sheep. So converting acres of the state’s primary corn and soybean fields may still raise eyebrows.
““
Solar grazing goats, meanwhile, has been “
Solar panels suited for sheep are ““
Sheep may be the state’s best option for large arrays because, Anderson thinks, there’s limited potential for solar panels to occupy the same land as the state’s traditional sprawling corn and soybean fields.
““
While solar grazing in Illinois might often replace corn or soybean production, Watson sees it as a positive trade-off.
““
The Watsons work with a solar developer called Pivot Energy. Since 202136511
“
## Improving the land
While solar grazing may not be more profitable than mechanical mowing for landowners, it leaves the soil in better condition than if it were left idle under the panels.
“
In climates like Illinois’, sheep must be housed and fed inside during winter — a considerable expense. But Brooke Watson noted that, unlike solar grazers in Western states, she and her husband don’t need to provide much water for sheep in summer, as the lush vegetation and frequent rain suffice. In any state, solar grazing means ensuring that there are safe fences or wires around sites and that predators are kept out.
““
The organization United Agrivoltaics connects would-be grazers with solar developers and provides resources for insurance and contracts, Winter added.
American Farmland Trust’s Midwest solar specialist Alan Bailey noted that existing crop residue or debris must be cleared and specific cover crops planted to prepare for solar grazing, but this can happen while an array is being built. “
Because solar grazing’s benefits to the land and environment are well established, Winter said, boosting the lamb market is “

The solar sheep are replacing at least to a large extent mechanical vegetation management, mowers with internal combustion engines. That needs to be added to the GHG equation along with increased soil organic carbon sequestered from long term rotational grazing. Finally, account for the GHG of conventional row crops that are replaced by regenerative grazing practices.

The sizable investment delivers a major vote of confidence in Base Power’s approach to a market that’s been tough for American companies to crack in a scalable way: connected, distributed energy. Base Power equips households with batteries for backup during outages, as long as they agree to buy power from the company and let it dispatch the batteries into Texas’ competitive energy markets managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT
It’s a beloved concept in clean energy circles, promising to decarbonize the grid while skipping the delays and expenses associated with upgrading the macro electricity system. But the distributed-energy vision for batteries hasn’t minted many standout successes for venture investors.
Each of the 50aggregate small-scale batteries and earn money by bidding them into power markets; other states require such activities to run through a monopoly utility, which may or may not be interested in disrupting its own business. Base Power will need to adapt its strategy to grow steadily nationwide, but the company is already testing a new structure for working with legacy utilities.
## Rapid growth in Texas energy market
It’s a turbulent time for cleantech investment generally, but Base Power raised its new financing from a group of VCs that aren’t primarily focused on climate or clean energy as a vertical. Dell and co. made that happen by showing rapid customer adoption.

Others have surpassed that since then, like Form Energy’s $450 for a novel iron-based battery. But those investments went to large-scale storage technology plays, not small-scale, aggregated storage models, which typically draw more modest sums from wonky climatetech specialists.
Dell declined to dwell too much on the robust quantity of new cash in hand.

## A domestic factory and national expansion on the way
Base Power will use some of its new funds to accelerate development of its own battery factory in Texas, Dell noted. The company is now searching for a site, with a focus on the Austin area, and could break ground by the end of the year.
Currently, Base Power uses contract manufacturers to turn its residential battery designs into a physical product; some but not all of the system is assembled in China.
That makes Base Power’s supply chain vulnerable to President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs, which raise the cost of imports from longstanding trading partners and geopolitical adversaries alike. The storage industry is still figuring out the damage from these tariffs; even domestic battery-cell production depends on imports for precursor materials, but

AC equipment made by Carrier, a century-old company that's now trying to reshape the impact that home-cooling systems have on the grid (Carrier)
The U.S. is a nation of air-conditioned houses, and this ubiquitous cooling machinery drives an outsize chunk of the country’s electrical demand, especially during heat waves. Now, as utilities scramble to meet even more power demand for AIHVAC
The concept is simple enough: Put a battery on central ACs that can charge up when energy is plentiful and take over the job of running the appliances when the grid is stressed. But actually doing that requires grappling with the forces that shape America’s energy system — monopoly utilities, regulators, decentralized energy, intermittent renewable power, and the looming colossus of data centers’ energy consumption.

Now Carrier has begun installing its HVAC-connected batteries in a pilot test with utilities to prove that the product works in customers’ homes. Some 15

Carrier hopes to eventually scale up the plan by getting electric utilities to pay for the batteries when households in their territory buy the company’s air conditioners. Then Carrier would operate the batteries based on signals from each utility, charging the devices at times of cheap, clean energy — like during midday in regions with lots of solar generation — and powering the cooling system directly from the battery when electricity demand surges.

Too often what looks good on paper breaks down in practice. Sending AC power to a home to be converted to DC power (to be stored in an HVAC system's onboard battery) to then be converted back to AC = ""conversion loss."" Whatever that is, multiply it by -- ultimately -- millions of consumers.
And for what? A battery that's only powerful enough to power one appliance? And for temporary (peak demand reduction management) time spans at that? That's a LOT of hardware/labor and downwind repairs/maintenance for, I fear, boondoggle-scale overall gain on a new, untested (hence, long-debugging period/expense) product. If “innovators” want to spend public (taxpayer, ratepayer) money, they should stop and cost-compare, for example, Big Picture scenarios like incentivizing Virtual Power Plants (VPP). Thus, on-grid/off-grid homeowners like me: At age 70, I just DIY-installed another 3.6KW of solar panels on my roof and have paired refrigerator and similar class loads with 2KWH-class solar generators like the Bluetti Elite 200 V2. That automatically puts money in my pocket (reduced power bills) WHILE reducing demand on the grid.
There are plenty of folks like me (and will be, soon, if my idea is adopted). Hence, consider (as a better plan) offering me/us a decent price to add even more solar (my metal roof can take on another 10KW) and an even larger battery that can be tapped by Big Power during peak periods. I wouldn't even expect any money up front (read: no subsidies!). Just guarantee me a decent rate (matching what power companies now pay for peaker plant power) when my home battery is tapped. This ""free market"" incentivizing would animate the very core of a VPP system: private investment with a power company purchase rate = win-win rate for owners/ratepayers. Rather than twaddle with millions of high-breakage/maintenance “mini-batteries” saddled with permanent AC-DC-AC conversion losses, VPPs should be explored to confirm what my gut says: That they will generate far more productive energy returns AND prosperity (I’m betting that many other, existing solar-generation owners like me would expand, thus creating more jobs and economic multiplier effects).
VPPs are already being tried in Vermont and elsewhere; I’d like to see that option explored here first. Because what's being pitched here sure seems Dead On Arrival. I’ll be opening up a “Low-Cost Solar” YouTube channel on this soon. “Watch this space.” James C. Desmond Gillis Springs, GA

Very interesting idea. A great follow up might look at the costs involved to see how financially practical it is. With over 4 million heat pumps sold in the US last year, and likely another 4 million air conditioners, that's 8 million batteries (if all heat pump/AC makers paired batteries with all sales. Based on the battery sizes mentioned - 5 to 10 KWH batteries, for reference.
For comparison a Telsa Powerwall 2 provides about 13 KWH and installed tends to run about $13K including installation, once federal rebates are gone.
Let's say that because of high volume, and the utilities doing it, a battery and installation being installed with a new heat pump or AC, costs are wholesale, and add $5K per battery/install cost.
That's a $40 billion a year expense for the Utilities. Using data from ChatGPT (hopefully accurate), Billable residential electric use is just under $200 Billion a year.
So the math indicates - if the numbers I'm using are anywhere near right - for the utilities to pay for the cost, their expenses are going to rise by something like $40 Billion a year, or 20%.
Who will pay for that - government subsidies to the utilities? New taxes on all consumers, or just increases in utility bills. Someone does have to pick up the tab.
Now if in the next few years this can become a $2,000 or even a $1000 cost item for battery and installation, the numbers start sounding more practical.
I would hope any such system, would be tied into a home, so that when a power outage occurred the same battery (if less efficiently) can be used to power refrigerators, lights, etc.
Looking forward to more info on Carrier's idea.

What a great concept! I'll bet they could get some states on board to further incentivize customers to be early adapters. Hopefully they can scale this up quickly.

Funding for Rhode Island’s energy-efficiency programs could be cut by more than $4290
Rhode Island Energy, the utility that administers the state’s energy-efficiency offerings, 18302023187
The result of these changes, according to climate action nonprofit Acadia Center, would be more expensive electricity and more exposure to volatile natural gas prices in the long run.
““
Rhode Island has traditionally been a leader in energy-efficiency programming. Over the past 1510200926
Now, however, the dynamics of energy markets are creating new obstacles. Nationwide, electricity costs have gone up at twice the rate of inflation over the past year, and gas prices have increased by more than four times the inflation rate. Rhode Island, like other New England states, has the added difficulty of already having some of the highest electricity rates in the country. Add in cold Northeastern winters, and the state is girding for an expensive season ahead.
As in neighboring states, regulators, elected officials, and utilities in Rhode Island are scrambling for ways to provide some relief for residents and businesses. These efforts have increasingly looked to the bill fees that fund renewable energy incentives and energy-efficiency programs as possible targets for quick, if small, bill reductions. In Maine, for example, leaders from both sides of the aisle have sought to lower incentives for customers and community solar developments that send power back to the grid, and in Massachusetts, utility regulators ordered energy-efficiency administrators to 5
Now, Rhode Island Energy is proposing rollbacks of its own, saying that its latest plan prioritizes customer affordability. The company has the support of the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, which points to the growth in accounts with overdue utility bills to bolster its argument that the changes will provide needed relief to consumers.
“
Advocates, however, say the approach is short-sighted.
““
Rhode Island’s energy-efficiency offerings include home energy assessments, weatherization services, rebates on energy-saving appliances and heating and cooling systems, and contractor training. Residents and businesses that take advantage of these programs generally save money by reducing their energy use.
The programs also create savings for the average consumer, whether or not they participate. Because the improvements slow energy consumption, they allow utilities to build less pricey infrastructure, the cost of which is passed on to customers. Efficiency measures can also lower peak demand, reducing the need to buy costlier, dirtier power from peaker plants. In Rhode Island, efficiency programs lowered electricity use 52005202415
Advocates, therefore, argue that Rhode Island Energy’s plan to shrink energy-efficiency spending won’t actually result in more affordable power in the long run.
“
Acadia Center’s analysis also finds that more than 800
The draft plan has been through multiple iterations; the most recent version was released on Sept. 525
Advocates say they intend to keep pushing for high funding levels until the process concludes.

This IS a retreat. Solar and batteries are the best way to reduce energy costs. We are down to 2 power bills yearly, January and February, and they those two are greatly reduced. Our household is insulated from future power price increases as well, and we are exploring methods to get rid of those last two bills. Looks doable.

A new state law will require Ohio utilities and regulators to consider how technology might offer cost-effective options for improving the state’s aging electric grid.
Ohio’s grid, like those in many states, faces rising repair and maintenance costs, growing demand from data centers and other new customers, and increased risks as climate change fuels more frequent severe weather and outages.
Clean energy advocates are hopeful the investments will also allow the grid to accommodate more renewable energy and battery storage projects, which can suffer costs and delays related to transmission bottlenecks.
“
Advanced transmission technologies that utilities must contemplate under HB15dynamic line rating. Digital controllers can remotely adjust the amount of power flowing through different parts of the grid, while topology optimization software can reroute power around congested areas, like a navigation app for electricity.
A key benefit of these technologies is that they can be used with existing infrastructure. When wires do need to be replaced, advanced conductors provide an energy-saving option. Those conductors use carbon composites or other materials to carry more electricity with less loss of that energy, compared to traditional wires of similar diameter.
A high-tech approach can create space on the grid for more renewable energy to come online. That would lessen the need to run expensive, polluting coal-fired power plants, said Rob Kelter, a senior attorney with the Environmental Law &
Besides helping to mitigate climate change, less pollution would help people’s health as well, Tavenor said.
Under HB15
The reports will be available to the public, and interested parties may ask the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to hold a hearing on whether utilities properly reported transmission information and whether they should be able to recover costs from customers.
The Ohio Power Siting Board must also require companies to consider technology solutions before it approves any new transmission projects. Companies would have to file reports and expert testimony to support any decision to forego advanced technologies in favor of conventional projects, Kelter said.
Advocacy groups and other stakeholders “
The law requires the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to study the costs and benefits of the various technologies, including how to streamline their deployment. That report will be due by March 1
Some Ohio utilities have already been exploring the potential for advanced transmission technologies. In 2023AES42
American Transmission Systems, a subsidiary of FirstEnergy, is planning to spend nearly $900“15
Many of the law’s potential benefits hinge on how the Ohio Power Siting Board and Public Utilities Commission of Ohio implement its terms when making decisions on siting and electric rates, Tavenor noted.
The law’s advanced technology provisions only apply to high-voltage parts of the grid that move electricity over long distances. It doesn’t require utilities to consider high-tech approaches to improving the local distribution lines that deliver electricity to homes and businesses.
So, for example, AEP30AEP214AEP
Similarly, the new law won’t address grid inequities affecting disadvantaged communities in FirstEnergy’s Ohio territory, which the Interstate Renewable Energy Council described in a
Even so, investments that use existing system capacity more effectively can still promote equity by reducing the need to build all-new transmission lines. Siting such infrastructure “
Building less brand-new transmission can also save consumers money. Ohioans have generally paid for transmission maintenance and upgrades through a “AEPHB15
““‘gold-plating’ by utilities, giving consumers more bang for the buck. We strongly advocate for this approach to transmission spending.”

Data centers are creating problems for the congested, overburdened U.S. power grid. One company thinks it can crowdsource the solution.
California-based “
Last month, the firm unveiled its “
The proposal comes as the nationwide boom in data center construction pushes electricity demand — find ways to enable rapid construction that don’t break the grid, or customers’ wallets.
That’s where the bring-your-own-capacity concept could fill the gaps, said Dana Guernsey, Voltus’ CEO
The approach benefits utilities and their customers because it’s a lot cheaper to reduce energy use than it is to build new power plants and infrastructure. And it benefits data centers by offering a much faster route to getting a grid interconnection, as developers wouldn’t have to wait years for utilities to bring new power generation online.
““
Voltus is in a good position to spearhead this work, she said. As a virtual power plant operator, it already aggregates backup batteries, electric vehicles, smart appliances, and other fast-responding technologies to provide on-demand relief to the grid. Voltus was recently dubbed 75“demand response” capacity under management.
In general, virtual power plants, or VPPs, could meet 102010
## What data center developers are looking for
Voltus already has one developer on board to participate in its bring-your-own-capacity plan:
“
Data centers, which are facing yearslong wait times to connect to the grid, are considering every available option. In Wisconsin, Cloverleaf is planning a 352030WEC
While specifics on that deal remain confidential, Janous noted that it could include demand response and VPP
“‘
Guernsey highlighted other examples of data centers bringing their own capacity to utilities. In August,
Most of the attention on those deals focused on Google’s commitment to shift its computing workloads to reduce peak grid demand — a novel approach to data center power flexibility that tackles the electricity consumption of the massive racks of servers within the facilities’ walls.
But
Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid-edge research for Wood Mackenzie, agreed that VPPs are theoretically a faster and cheaper means of achieving data center flexibility compared to the alternatives.
Most tech companies haven’t done the hard work that Google has done over the past decade or so to enable flexible computing, he said. Data center developers will face cost and air-quality challenges in using their ubiquitous diesel-fueled backup generators for on-site power. And they may be loath to invest in more expensive options like on-site solar, batteries, and gas-fired generators and microturbines — the “
““
Demand-response programs and VPPs can also counteract utility customers’ rising power bills, since these initiatives financially compensate the individuals who allow their energy use to be managed.
““
## Are data center developers willing to pay?
It won’t be easy to turn these ideas into reality.
Utilities and regional grid operators consider demand response and VPPs primarily as a tool for managing existing grid stresses, but are far less eager to allow VPPs to substitute for building more traditional power plants and upgrading the grid. It’s always a tall order to get utilities to do something for the first time, but especially so when dealing with data centers, which can require a small city’s worth of electricity for their operations.
Guernsey conceded these challenges to Voltus’ plan. “20272028“‘
One of Voltus’ key early targets is PJM13Electricity bills are spiking for the region’s more than 65data center hotspots like Georgia and
Johannes Pfeifenberger, a grid-planning expert and principal with The Brattle Group, has argued for years that grid operators need to embrace VPPs and other innovations to “VPPEV
But putting this solution into practice will require grid operators to restructure the rules by which VPPs can directly reduce a data center’s impact on the system, he said. 14
Data centers may also be limited by the capacity of the power lines and substations at the points they’re seeking to connect to the grid, he said. VPPs that consist of customers scattered across a grid operator’s territory can’t relieve those specific stresses, although other options could, such as data centers colocating at spots with ample grid capacity and building their own generation to fill those gaps, he said.
Guernsey agreed that Voltus’ bring-your-own-capacity construct “
Janous thinks data center developers are willing to pay even more than the currently inflated prices for energy if it means they can move faster. Grid operators just have to be willing to allow them to cut deals with companies like Voltus to go do it.
“
In the face of those pressures, allowing data centers and VPP

The recent cancellation of a Massachusetts networked geothermal project isn’t dampening enthusiasm for the emerging clean-heat strategy.
National Grid said this month it has abandoned a planned geothermal system in Lowell, Massachusetts, due to higher-than-expected costs. The news disappointed advocates who see networked geothermal as an important tool for transitioning from natural gas heat, but they pointed to many more reasons for optimism about the concept’s momentum.
The nation’s first utility-operated neighborhood geothermal network, a loop serving 3652
““
## How it all started
The idea for utility-operated networked geothermal systems, often also referred to as thermal energy networks, originated in Massachusetts. The concept grew out of conversations about the environmental and public health dangers posed by aging and increasingly leaky natural gas pipes.
In 201442air-source heat pumps were catching on, a growing trend that would leave fewer and fewer gas consumers to foot the bill for pipeline repairs.
In 2017HEET
Thermal energy networks scale up the process, connecting many buildings to one geothermal loop, allowing heating and cooling to be delivered to homes in much the same way gas and electricity are. At the same time, they offer a new business model for gas utilities grappling with states’ efforts to transition away from fossil fuels. Utilities liked the idea and jumped on board.
In 2023
## Geothermal networks are still heating up
The University of Massachusetts Lowell, which was a partner in National Grid’s now-canceled project, hopes to use the engineering and design work developed for the project as the basis for a future network, said Ruairi O’Mahony, senior executive director of the university’s Rist Institute for Sustainability and Energy.
Even the cancellation provides valuable insight by providing a case study of what didn’t work, said Audrey Schulman, executive director of HEETlabs, a climate solutions incubator that spun off from HEET““
Meanwhile, the Framingham network began hooking up its first customers in August 2024956
Plans are already underway to expand the system. The U.S. Department of Energy in December awarded Eversource, the city of Framingham, and HEET782026
“20
The widespread interest in networked geothermal systems within Massachusetts and throughout the U.S. is also promising, Camargo said. In Massachusetts, National Grid is continuing work on a different geothermal network pilot serving seven multifamily public housing buildings in the Boston neighborhood of Dorchester. Last year, HEET45000013
New York has also embraced the idea with enthusiasm. In 202211
““
Across the country, between 2227
A report prepared by Synapse Energy Economics for HEETlabs and released last month concludes that geothermal networks offer significant financial benefits when compared with using air-source heat pumps. The analysis found that each system roughly the size of the Framingham network could generate from $1535150052
These savings could be used to subsidize building retrofits, making the homes and offices connected to a geothermal network highly energy efficient to optimize the impact of the ground-source heat pumps, Schulman said.
## Challenges remain
Even with gathering momentum, challenges remain to the widespread adoption of geothermal networks.
Retrofitting buildings on the network is perhaps the thorniest, particularly in the Northeast where much of the building stock is older and draftier, said both utilities and advocates. In Framingham, an individual efficiency plan had to be created for each home and structure on the loop, a time- and money-consuming process. Going forward, a more streamlined, standardized procedure will likely be necessary, Camargo and Bosworth both said.
“
Cost is another concern, as the terminated Lowell project demonstrates. However, costs are likely to come down as engineers and installers gain experience in the process and develop smoother supply chains, Schulman said. The second loop planned for Framingham is already likely to be half the amount of the initial system, she said.
As these challenges are worked through, it is vital for Massachusetts to approach its role as a leader in geothermal networks with care, Schulman said.

### What’s next
While the Senate’s proposal steps back some from the House version, tax credits that directly benefit consumers remain the most at risk. And as many experts have warned, those slashed tax credits will major clean power projects at risk.
Still, these changes aren’t set in stone. Once the whole bill is drafted, the Senate will have to actually pass it, and then reconcile its differences with the House, with an ultimate goal of getting the package on President Donald Trump’s desk by July 4
## Another big energy story

The milestone comes as the U.S. under the Trump administration moves backward on clean energy. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump signed into law the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act, which will rapidly phase out subsidies for solar and wind energy. Last week, his Energy Department released a controversial report that experts say will likely be used to justify extending the life of aging, uneconomical coal-fired power plants.
While the Trump administration seeks to tether the U.S. to fossil fuels, Europe and much of the world continue accelerating toward cleaner options.

The newest career technical education program set for Ukiah High School, called Roots of Success, will train high school students specifically for green energy fields. However, Spackman said that basic training in construction gives students skills that transfer to a variety of work, especially given the state’s regulations for the trades to go green.
““
Leaders from both the high school and college workforce development programs agree that while there’s plenty of work for their students and a growing demand for clean energy workers, trades training is hindered by a severe shortage of teachers.
Crawford said anyone with three years of experience in a specific field can get a designated subject teaching credential and become qualified by the state of California. Woodhouse said that Mendocino College’s minimum qualifications include an associate degree and experience in the field.
Other challenges, Woodhouse said, are those stacked against the students in a county with high rates of substance abuse and poverty. To address those, he highlighted support systems at the college that include a food pantry, mental health services, and transportation, among others.

State and federal hurdles pile up for community solar
Community solar is in trouble, and it’s not just because of federal shakeups, Canary Media’s Alison F. Takemura reports. These shared arrays help make solar power accessible to those who can’t put panels on their own roofs, whether that’s because they rent, can’t afford them, or face other barriers. That power can in turn help households reduce their bills.
But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed in July set an early sunset for tax credits that can cover as much as half of a community solar array’s cost. And states are also contributing to the decline. Developers in New York, a major community solar market, are facing higher costs for land and permitting, while in Maine, developers have to reckon with changes to its solar net-metering program, as well as lowered compensation and new fees for community solar projects.
Those state challenges, combined with the looming threat of more federal funding cuts, have all led Wood Mackenzie to 82030

Connecticut could become the latest state to pursue networked geothermal systems as a way of cutting greenhouse gas emissions, improving public health, and reducing energy cost burdens for residents.
State lawmakers are considering a bill,
“
The bill enjoys wide support from environmental advocates, community leaders, and business interests. Several parties are pushing for changes they say would make even more of an impact, such as requiring utilities to propose pilot projects, following the example of New York, which included such a mandate in a 2022
Also, as drafted, the bill does not specify a funding mechanism for the grant and loan program it would create. Several stakeholders have suggested adding language that authorizes the state to issue a bond to fund the program.
“20
Advocates point to the emissions reductions the systems can achieve. More than 4037
Geothermal networks can also save customers money because the energy underground is free and ground-source heat pumps use far less electricity than air-source heat pumps or electric resistance heat. In Framingham, Massachusetts, the country’s first utility-scale geothermal network is projected to cut some customers’ heating bills by as much as 75
The adoption of geothermal networks can also help utilities — and their workers — transfer skills into a new field as energy systems transition away from natural gas, supporters said.
“
Geothermal heat pumps have been around for more than 1002017HEET2024135
Other states have seen the promise in geothermal networks, too. Six states in addition to New York and Massachusetts have passed legislation supporting utility construction of thermal energy networks, according to the Building Decarbonization Coalition, and some 2227
In Connecticut, environmental groups have been discussing the geothermal possibilities with utilities for a few years, said Shannon Laun, the Conservation Law Foundation’s vice president for Connecticut. Eversource has shown interest in developing a pilot project and taken preliminary steps to seek approval to proceed, but specific legislation supporting geothermal networks would be more likely to galvanize action from utilities, she said.

Offshore wind leasing is effectively dead in the U.S. following a Trump administration order issued this week.
Large swaths of U.S. waters that had been identified by federal agencies as ideal for offshore wind are no longer eligible for such developments under an Interior Department statement released Wednesday.
In the BOEM“35
The move comes just a day after Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered his staff “
The outlook was already grim for new offshore wind leasing activity following President Donald Trump’s executive order in January that introduced a temporary ban on the practice. Wednesday’s announcement makes that policy more definitive. Wind power advocates say it will erase several years of work from federal agencies and local communities to determine the best possible areas for wind development.
“
Figuring out the best spot to place offshore wind is an involved undertaking. The proposed areas start off enormous and, according to the Interior staffer, undergo a careful, multiyear winnowing process to settle on the official “
Take the process for designating the wind energy area known as “2023
The draft area — or “40BOEMNASANASA2024
The winnowing didn’t stop there. By 2024BOEM2026BOEM
But the Trump administration is no friend to offshore wind.
Trump officials have repeatedly targeted wind projects by pulling permits and even halting one wind farm during construction. Last month, Trump’s “20262027particularly devastating for offshore projects not already underway. Currently, five major offshore wind farms are under construction in the U.S., and when they come online, they will help states from Virginia to Massachusetts meet their rising energy demand with carbon-free power.
Wednesday’s order halts all work on Central Atlantic 2
These wind energy areas could hypothetically be re-designated by a future administration or the policy reversed, according to the Interior Department employee. Still, in the best case, that means developers will have to wait several more years for new lease areas to become available, further slowing down an industry whose projects already take many years to go through permitting and construction.

At this point in time I don't see the project as economical for Cleveland-Cliffs. This company has been struggling. If it can make steel for $390/ton now, why on earth would they spend $1.1BILLION to convert to a hydrogen process? The first piece of infrastructure that it has to have to operate doesn't even exist. It's a no brainer. Even if the infrastructure existed, the steel would still be $160/ton more expensive to produce. A recovering company can't compete by going into debt and also raising its cost.

In addition, as other Nations impose Surcharges etc. on Polluting, ""Dirty Steel"" or are completely boycotted by the ROW, the USA will further fall behind...

The population of cities outside of NYC lost 20% from 1970-2000 and that trend is continuing for 80% of those cities .

Just another dumb thing that schould stay in the city only, in upstate we already have clean air and I will be building my house with propane in a few years. I do installs myself and will dig my own tank and the idiots in Albany won't know the difference. Stop Albany already my god. I would move but my farm is here but if it gets much worse I'll just have to sell and buy another.

Across California, hundreds of homes and businesses have signed up their solar panels, batteries, EVs, and appliances to be part of “virtual power plants” — networks of scattered energy resources that utilities can control to stave off blackouts and cut electricity prices.
Now, utilities are exploring another way to leverage VPPs: Strategically concentrating the systems in certain areas could let the companies defer expensive upgrades to nearby poles, wires, and other infrastructure. But first, utilities need to be 100

## Proving that VPPs can match local grid needs
Distribution networks are distinct from the huge transmission lines that move the energy produced by power plants over long distances. Local distribution infrastructure instead carries power from substations — the big, fenced-in collections of equipment that lower the voltage of transmission-fed power — along main feeder lines, and eventually to the wires that connect to neighborhoods, homes, and businesses.
Until recently, utilities lacked technologies like smart meters and grid sensors to let them see what’s actually going on on those parts of their grids. That visibility is important, because these distribution networks have unique and fluctuating needs and characteristics — or load shapes, in industry parlance —that determine where when

Lots of utilities are already using these technologies to reduce system-wide electricity peaks. In fact, demand-response programs have existed for decades. But beyond a handful of projects, utilities have yet to leverage VPPs as a way to defer investments in their distribution grids.

New York state is one step closer to banning fossil fuels in new buildings.
On Friday, the State Fire Prevention and Building Code Council voted to recommend major updates to the state’s building code, which is updated every five years and sets minimum standards for construction statewide. The draft updates include rules requiring most new buildings to be all-electric starting in 2026
The vote came after the code council went missing in action for more than two months, leaving some advocates nervous that the state might be

The Department of State, which oversees New York’s code development process, did not respond to a request for comment.
Buildings are New York’s largest source of emissions, according to the RMI2000
Cutting that pollution will require major upgrades to the state’s aging housing stock — an enormous challenge. But climate hawks stress that the first and easiest step is to stop digging the hole deeper, by making new buildings as climate-friendly as possible. Making them all-electric is a key part of that. But other, subtler changes can also play an important role.
The fossil-fuel industry, for its part, is taking those changes seriously. Gas trade groups led a

The city of Minneapolis is retooling a decade-old partnership with its gas and electric utilities in response to criticism that it hasn’t done enough to help the city reach its climate goals.
The Clean Energy Partnership was established in 2014 as part of the city’s last round of utility franchise agreements with Xcel Energy and CenterPoint Energy. The agreements authorize utilities’ use of public right-of-way, often in exchange for fees or meeting other terms or conditions from the city.
A little over a decade ago, Minneapolis was among the first U.S. cities to view utility franchise agreements as a potential tool to leverage for climate action. Some advocates at the time had been pressuring the city to study creating a municipal utility to accelerate clean energy, and the partnership emerged as a compromise to give the city more say in the utilities’ operations.
Former City Council member Cam Gordon, who represented southeast Minneapolis in 2014““PR
The City Council is set to approve new franchise agreements this week, and they include an updated memorandum of understanding for the Clean Energy Partnership that will require regular reporting on key performance indicators, new utility-specific emission goals, energy conservation, and service reliability in disadvantaged neighborhoods.
Spokespeople for both companies said they welcome the planned changes and that the agreement reflects their interest in working with city leaders on shared clean energy goals.
Since the partnership went into effect in 2015
Minneapolis City Council Vice President Aisha Chughtai, who represents the council on the partnership board, expressed frustration about the lack of follow-through from utilities. “
By the partnership’s own measures, it has failed to make significant progress on five out of the city’s seven major climate goals. The city is on track with its target to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from municipal operations but behind pace with its goals related to citywide, residential, commercial, or industrial emissions.
Going forward, the partnership board will continue to meet quarterly, but instead of revolving around city climate goals, each utility will be expected to hit specific targets within Minneapolis’s borders. CenterPoint will commit to reducing emissions from natural gas use by at least 2020352021
““
CenterPoint agreed to send a more senior executive to attend the quarterly partnership meetings, though Xcel did not. The utilities also rejected the city’s proposal to hire an outside administrator to manage the partnership.
City leaders believe the new agreement does a better job of setting expectations, but Minneapolis will still lack formal leverage over the utilities if they fail to make progress. The agreement does not contain any penalties for failure to follow through, and the next window to renegotiate isn’t until 2035
Luke Hollenkamp, the city’s sustainability program coordinator, said data reported through the partnership allows the city to make course corrections in its climate work.
“
Xcel Energy’s spokesperson said the partnership has led to successes, noting that citywide emissions from electricity have declined and that Minneapolis met its goal of powering city operations with 1002023
CenterPoint said it has invested nearly $61201725245000
Despite the partnership’s imperfections, current and former city officials said it’s better to keep it in place as part of the new franchise agreements than to let it dissolve.

Thank you for reporting the REACT Alliance and NOOA opposition to offshore floating wind on the California Central Coast and Humboldt Bay. Even more ominous is the CADEMO plan to place four giant (15 MW each - 870 feet tall - about three times the height of the Statue of Liberty) floating offshore wind turbines 2.8 miles offshore from Vandenberg Space Force Base. There are adverse national security implications with the CADEMO project. CADEMO is also in the path of migrating large marine mammals and is part of the Pacific Flyway for migrating birds.

Off shore wind masquerades as an ""environmental"" option, but it is NOT a green program! Off shore wind is absolutely devastating to marine environments, and destroys the ocean eco-system, including killing whales and dolphins. Canary Media neglected to include that off shore wind is funded by the oil and gas industry, yet calls out the real environmentalists for doing true environmental work. I completely stand with REACT Alliance!

Five years ago, San Francisco–based startup Span debuted a EVHVAC
But as more households purchase EVs, heat pumps, induction stoves, and other power-hungry devices, the demand for cheaper ways to control their electricity use is growing — not just from homeowners trying to avoid expensive electrical upgrades but utilities struggling to keep up with rising power demand, too.
Enter the Span Edge, unveiled at the Distributech utility trade show in Dallas this week. The device packs the startup’s core technology into a package that can be installed in about 15
Span’s other products are targeted at homeowners; electrical contractors; and solar, battery, and EV“CEO
That makes it one of a growing number of tools for utilities to manage the solar, batteries, EVs, controllable appliances, and other distributed energy resources that they must increasingly plan around.
If utilities manage these resources reactively, they could drive up the cost and complexity of managing the grid. But if utilities can get better information about when and how these devices use power — and if some customers are willing to adjust them sometimes to reduce grid stress — they could actually save ratepayers a lot of money.
That’s what Span’s new technology aims to allow. The company’s “total draw on the utility grid stays below a home’s top electrical service capacity, which typically ranges between 100200
Households that want to exceed the limit of their electrical panel are often forced to upgrade to a larger one. Depending on where you live, that can cost from $300010000 and add days to weeks of extra time to a project, like installing an EVEV
It’s also expensive for utilities. “EV‘
Installing a device like the Span Edge could well be a more cost-effective alternative, not just for the customers who get one but for customers as a whole. Utility rates are largely determined by dividing the amount of money earned from electricity sales by the amount of money utilities have to collect from customers to cover their costs. A big and rising portion of U.S. utility costs is tied up in upgrading and maintaining their power grids, including to meet rising demand for power from EVs and heat pumps. As a result, ratepayers in many parts of the country are seeing higher bills.
If devices like the Span Edge can cut those grid costs while allowing people to buy more electricity for EVs and heating, rates for everyone will drop over time, Rao said. While some utilities may balk at replacing profitable grid-upgrade investments with new technology, others that want customers to electrify to meet carbon-reduction mandates or to increase electricity sales may be eager to implement it, he argued.

Span’s smart electrical panel was among the first attempts to give the old-fashioned electrical panel a 21st
But similar products that also embed circuit-level controls are now available from major manufacturers, including Lunar Energy, and
Utilities have been experimenting with such technologies for a while. Some plug directly into utilities’ existing electric meters, including the Span Edge, ConnectDER’s
Others are embedded elsewhere in a home’s electrical system, like the controls product startup “EV“
The trick for all of these technologies is to combine the convenience and simplicity consumers demand with utility safety and reliability requirements, said Scott Hinson, chief technology officer of Austin, Texas–based nonprofit research organization Pecan Street.

On the other hand, rudimentary on-off control switches are far from ideal, Hinson said.

More importantly, Hinson said, a good system needs to control “EV“
Span’s devices have two ways to do this, Rao said. Because they contain the connection points for power to flow through circuit breakers to a home’s electrical wiring, the devices can directly measure how much power household loads are using — and cut them off completely in an emergency.
At the same time, Span uses WiFi or other technologies to communicate with “EVfor EVs, how quickly they need to be recharged to give the driver the juice they need to get to where they’re going next.
What’s important is that a system can provide both options, Rao contended. ““
## What’s in it for utilities — and their customers?
Having both visibility into and control over home electricity flows creates the groundwork for a more flexible approach to enlisting homes in utility virtual power plants, or VPPs. In simple terms, VPPs are aggregations of homes and businesses that agree to turn down power use or inject power onto the grid as utilities need, helping reduce reliance on large centralized power plants.
Most of the virtual power plants that exist today are organized around individual devices — smart thermostats that can reduce electricity demand from air conditioning, for example, or solar-battery systems that can send power back to the grid. Each of these technologies has its limitations, and utilities’ reliance on them is often constrained by a lack of precise data on how much power the grid is using or can offer at any particular time.
A system that tracks the energy use of multiple appliances and devices in a home could bring far more precision to these VPPs, Rao said. “‘
Utilities certainly have a growing interest in using these kinds of devices. On Monday, Pacific Gas &“
PG&1500400done VPP, and Span, which will use its technology to allow homes to respond to utility signals.
Span has already tested this capability in a pilot project enlisting customers who’ve installed the company’s smart panels in Northern California, Rao said. The results so far are promising, although only a handful of households are taking part.
Getting utilities to deploy Span Edge devices could expand the scale of those kinds of programs, he said. Of course, households will have to agree that letting some of their electricity use get turned off or dialed down during hours of peak grid stress is worth avoiding the cost and wait times of upgrading their electrical service to get the EV
Span hasn’t revealed the cost of the Span Edge, which Rao said will soon be deployed in pilot projects with as-yet unnamed utilities. The company has a partnership with major smart-meter vendor Landis+Gyr, which is offering the Span Edge to its utility customers.
The question for utilities, regulators, and other stakeholders is whether the long-term payoff in avoided infrastructure upgrades is worth the cost of the technologies that must be deployed to make that possible. Those calculations will inform decisions such as whether customers getting the technologies should pay a portion of the price tag and how much profit utilities should be allowed to earn on the costs they bear in installing the tech.

Texas legislators have a new plan for their state’s famously competitive energy market, and it looks a lot like the government picking winners and losers.
On Wednesday, the 50“ERCOT
If passed by the House and signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, the bill effectively would penalize renewables and reward a subset of dispatchable generators that politicians in Austin favor. Such a policy would upend the ERCOT
SB388Renewables and battery developers have thrived thanks to the wide-open competitive energy market, abundant land, relatively easy permitting requirements, and the nation’s fastest timelines to interconnect projects to the grid. Texas is building more solar and battery capacity today than any other state, California included; on average, developers have connected about 1
That rapid pace of construction has already mitigated power shortages during heat waves last summer, reducing the kind of price spikes that consumers were subjected to in previous years. And building power plants quickly is exactly what the U.S. needs to keep pace with surging demand from domestic industry and AI.
Lewin didn’t mince words about the potential fallout from the gas-generation mandate and other proposed restrictions on clean energy in Texas: “
Fossil gas remains the largest source of electricity generation nationwide, but it has slipped to just 7 expected to come online in 202593ERCOT2023
Part of the problem for gas plant owners is that renewables are producing more megawatt-hours cheaply, driving down the returns that gas plants make during hours that solar and wind produce a lot of energy. Texas gas plants looked to the peak summer hours to boost their profits for the year, but now solar and batteries are cutting into those hours, too.
The challenges go beyond ERCOT
Without hope of hitting the 502026““
The Senate did moderate its stance as the bill advanced. Changing the language from explicitly privileging gas to “
Senators also carved out a reprieve for pure-play battery operators, implicitly recognizing the role batteries have assumed in dispatching power on demand when the market needs it most.
“
Now the House will get to weigh in, as will the business community that has grown accustomed to buying power from competitive markets, without having to consider the preferences of elected officials. It’s unclear whether the governor would sign the bill if given the chance. Revamping ERCOT“

In the largely Black, overwhelmingly poor town of Enfield, North Carolina, Mayor Mondale Robinson sees clean energy as a path forward. The town’s residents face massive winter electric bills, in part because its housing stock is old and inefficient, and also because it buys a lot of its energy thirdhand. Canary Media’s Elizabeth Ouzts dove into Robinson’s efforts to reduce Enfield’s energy burden, which start with a solar farm and accompanying battery that could supply enough electricity for the whole town. Next up is a new substation, followed by a solar-powered community resilience center.
If these projects come to fruition, Enfield could become a model for climate-driven revitalization in similarly struggling towns — though that success depends on whether Enfield can secure the funding needed to get the job done.

These programs are cost effective and provide even more potential. I am no expert in CA but my question is why policymakers and regulators in the state decide to use taxpayer funds to operate VPPs and then hit ratepayers with fire related costs. It doesn't make much sense to me. Utilities can fold in the cost effectiveness of VPPs more effectively. Sure, utilities need to harden infrastructure to prevent fires, but the fires are more a function of the climate -- which seems to be more of a general taxpayer item.

Emirates Global Aluminium plans to build a $4 billion smelter in Oklahoma. (EGA)
Plans are in the works to build America’s first new aluminum smelters in nearly half a century. The two facilities, slated to go online in possibly Kentucky in the coming years, would dramatically boost domestic production of the versatile metal if completed as planned.
But for that to happen, they will first have to secure a steady supply of electricity, at a time when AIcompeting fiercely for a share of the country’s limited power resources, and as the grid is strained by surging demand.
The smelters proposed by Emirates Global Aluminium and Century Aluminum would be energy hogs. Each plant is expected to produce about 600000
For the economics to pencil out for either facility, that power will need to be cheap. And it will need to be produced from carbon-free sources, like wind or solar, for the aluminum they produce to be more competitive on the global market, which increasingly favors low-carbon metal.
Unfortunately for American aluminum producers, both clean and affordable power are only getting harder to come by.
Electricity demand in the U.S. is rising faster than supply is forecast to grow, which is pushing up prices. Aging grid infrastructure and slow permitting timelines have long delayed the build-out of new power generation. Now the Trump administration and GOP-led Congress are creating additional financial and legal headwinds for wind, solar, and battery storage projects — the only resources that can be built fast enough to meet demand in the near term.

## Affordable, clean energy remains key to powering smelters
Outside the United States, nearly all primary aluminum smelters receive some form of government backing in the countries where they operate — typically by ensuring access to affordable energy, said Sartor of Industrious Labs.
She pointed to Canada, the largest supplier of U.S. aluminum imports. Smelters in Quebec draw from the region’s abundant hydropower resources, which are operated by the government-owned entity Hydro-Quebec. The price of electricity that producers pay is often tied to the price of aluminum on commodities markets, so that smelters pay less during lean times and more when the market recovers.
“
Manufacturers and utilities can also structure power-supply agreements that enable smelters to benefit, rather than strain, the grid, said Anna Johnson, a senior researcher in the industry program at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
“
In New Zealand, for example, Rio Tinto’s Tiwai Point smelter receives financial incentives to curb its electricity use — and therefore lower its aluminum production — during dry seasons, when hydropower resources can become critically low. In Australia, the aluminum giant Alcoa is participating in a program that turns one of its smelters into an emergency resource when the grid is overly stressed. The Australian government pays Alcoa to halt production on some of its aluminum-making potlines for about an hour at a time.
In the U.S., other types of industrial plants — including a titanium-melting plant in West Virginia — are using behind-the-meter solar power and battery storage systems, so that the facilities are primarily drawing from the electrical grid only during off-peak hours.
Strategies like these that reduce electricity rates are especially crucial now that the development of cheap, renewable energy is set to slow in the United States. But manufacturers will still need access to new carbon-free electricity sources in order to produce the cleaner aluminum that customers are increasingly demanding, Sartor said.

Both Strater and Leathers said they switched to electric workboats for several reasons. Their new watercraft are a cleaner alternative to the smelly, polluting petroleum-powered vessels that dominate Maine’s 350010
“
Battery-powered vessels are starting to catch on in the United States and worldwide as companies and maritime authorities work to reduce emissions and improve the experience of cruising waterways. The technology ranges from small outboard motors on workboats and recreational watercraft to powerful inboard systems on ferries, tugboats, and supply vessels for offshore wind farms and oil rigs.
In recent decades, Norway, with its extensive coastline and ample government funding, has spearheaded the transition globally. China, which is both the world’s largest shipbuilder and battery manufacturer, has rapidly deployed hundreds of battery-powered vessels over the last several years. Falling battery costs, better technology, and stricter environmental rules are compelling some vessel owners to install partial or fully electric systems, primarily for watercraft that operate near the shore or on fixed routes. For commercial fishing in particular, customers are helping to drive the push to clean up.

Buying a boat, of course, is only the first obstacle. Electric vessel owners must also learn how to use their new propulsion systems and find a place to charge them.
This summer, Leathers said he’s had no trouble making the nearly two-mile round trip from the slip where he docks Heron in South Freeport, Maine, to his farm on Casco Bay. With a full charge, he can make trips slightly farther to meet distributors closer to Portland. But as temperatures drop this winter, Leathers said he’s not sure how far the outboards’ two batteries will take him. Cold weather can reduce battery capacity and impact performance, shrinking an electric motor’s range. It’s a part of Leathers’ demonstration to find out what the impacts are in practice.

Maine will need much more high-capacity charging infrastructure for the marine industry to transition to electric propulsion, said the Island Institute’s Morris. As the state’s aquaculture and fisheries industries look to grow beyond small-scale operations, other businesses will need to charge more frequently to make longer, farther trips up and down the coast.
Expanding charging stations north of Casco Bay represents what Morris calls a “
This challenge is compounded by both New England’s aging grid infrastructure and the remote nature of some of the region’s waterfront access points. Getting the right amount of power to a charging station on the shore can be costly, even in Yarmouth, which sits on Casco Bay. Often it’s the last mile that can be the most expensive. At Sea Meadow Marine Foundation, three-phase power, which can accommodate higher loads, is limited by the dirt road that separates the boat launch from the more heavily trafficked U.S. Route 1

Back on the water, Leathers docked his electric boat, Heron, alongside the sea farm’s barge, where thousands of oysters pass through for processing on harvest days. He switched the motor off and hopped onto the floating platform. For a moment, the bay was calm to the point of near silence. Then Leathers picked up an oyster cage with a rattle, turning it over in his hands as water splashed out. The sounds of the workday began.

Regulators have approved plans from Unitil and National Grid to reduce electricity rates for heat pump owners during the region’s often-frigid winter months, and Eversource is preparing its own proposal. Together, the three utilities provide service to about 86
The goal of the rates is to accelerate adoption of heat pumps by making it cheaper to run these super-efficient, low-carbon appliances in a region where the economics of switching from fossil-fueled heating don’t always pencil out for homeowners.
““
Utility regulators are already looking into that question,
Expanding the use of heat pumps is a major part of Massachusetts’ strategy for reaching its ambitious goal of going carbon-neutral by 205080

## The economics of operating a heat pump in Massachusetts
The persistently high cost of electricity in Massachusetts — only three states had
Most households now using oil, propane, or electric resistance heating would likely save money by using heat pumps, regardless of electric rates. But for many consumers using relatively cheap natural gas, the added electricity use from switching to heat pumps would drive their total costs up. That’s where seasonal heat-pump rates come into play, charging lower prices to homes using heat pumps so the added power consumption doesn’t translate into higher total energy bills.
Unitil was the first of Massachusetts’ three main investor-owned electric utilities to put forth a seasonal heat-pump rate, receiving regulatory approval in June for a discount of 764ordered National Grid to do the same; that proposal was approved in February. In the state Department of Public Utilities’ order launching the investigation into heat pump rates, regulators required Eversource to submit its own such plan by May 15
These lower rates are possible because utilities are essentially overcharging heat pump customers for their winter electricity use under the current system, said Mark Kresowik, senior policy director for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
On each utility bill, customers pay, of course, for the electricity they use. They also pay a delivery charge that funds the construction and maintainence of a grid that can accommodate moments of peak demand: those few hot summer evenings when dishwashers, televisions, and millions of air conditioners are running at the same time.
In the winter, though, average demand is much lower, so the strain on the grid is much lighter. During these months, the delivery charge doesn’t properly reflect the actual costs of keeping the grid running, said Kyle Murray, Massachusetts program director for clean energy nonprofit Acadia Center.
Households that operate heat pumps in the winter are ““
## Public input will help refine Massachusetts heat pump discounts
A collaboration of state agencies, known as the Interagency Rates Working Group, 51878500
Though more numbers need to be crunched, energy advocates are inclined to support a deeper discount. Because of the high cost of electricity in Massachusetts, a larger rate reduction might be needed to make a heat pump a competitive choice, they said.
“
As part of the investigation into seasonal heat-pump rate design, regulators have asked the public to submit comments by June 2
In most cases before utility regulators, outside organizations can only participate if they become formal intervenors and have a lawyer representing them. It is expensive, time-consuming, and beyond the reach of many advocacy groups and most individuals, Chretien said. The request for comments from any interested parties opens up the proceedings, he said, allowing anyone with a stake in climate or energy affordability issues to participate.
““
For this approach to make a real impact, however, regulators must have a plan for reaching out to all communities, not just the narrow slice of people who are aware of public utilities regulations and issues, said Charles Hua, founder of consumer education nonprofit PowerLines. It will be important to connect with groups of different income and education levels, to ensure everyone has a voice.

RE: ""Households that operate heat pumps in the winter are ​“not actually putting much stress on the system at all,” he said. ​“They really shouldn’t have to pay as much as they are.”""
The rationale for lower winter electric rates is that peak electric demand, with peak stress to maintain and expand the grid, occurs in summer. However, assuming promotion of heat pumps is successful and more and more homes adopt them, peak electric demand in MA will soon shift from summer to winter. Isn't that an argument that the electric rates should, if anything, be higher in winter than in summer?

My understanding is that transition to a winter peak will take several years, John, and rates would need to be adjusted accordingly then.

Energy industry analysts have been scrambling to assess the harms that President Donald Trump’s vast majority of new electricity supply in the U.S. It’s not looking good.
They’ve also been trying to determine how the Trump administration’s tariffs on individual countries, as well as on materials such as steel and aluminum, will impact the U.S. manufacturers they’re purportedly meant to help. That includes the factories for EVs, lithium-ion batteries, solar panels, and other nascent cleantech sectors whose growth was just beginning to revitalize the long-stagnant U.S. manufacturing economy. Again, things aren’t looking good.
The broad economic havoc caused by last week’s announcements will itself have wide-reaching consequences. U.S. stock markets saw their
The dramatic tariffs come as the Trump administration promises to
But analysts say the tariffs, if they stick, will threaten all of these goals. They could hobble the clean-energy manufacturing buildout, which was set into motion by Biden-era industrial policy and is poised to deliver tens of thousands of factory jobs, mostly to Republican-led congressional districts. They could also make it far more expensive to build any sort of energy infrastructure in the U.S. — clean or dirty.

Other tariffs target the automotive industry and foreign-produced steel and aluminum. All in all, “
That holds true for conventional fossil-fuel projects like oil and gas pipelines, fossil gas–fired power plants, and liquefied natural gas terminals, he noted — all of which are industries favored by the Trump administration. But it’s also the case for renewable and low-carbon energy projects such as solar and wind farms, utility-scale battery projects, green hydrogen plants, biogas plants, and the panoply of materials and equipment needed to expand and modernize the U.S. electric grid.
All of these sectors rely on imports of raw materials such as steel and aluminum, which Trump

## Ranking the risks to solar, wind, and batteries
Despite this complexity, some predictions can be made. One key distinction is between solar and wind power, sectors where tariffs either already exist or may have less impact, and lithium-ion batteries, which will be subject to far higher tariffs than ever before.
Despite a rapid expansion of domestic solar-manufacturing capacity, the U.S. remains dependent on imports — and most of the world’s 2449
But solar developers in the U.S. are already acclimated to more than a decade of
On the one hand, this has “
On the other, it has also normalized high costs for imported products in the industry, somewhat softening the blow of the new tariffs. U.S. buyers have also 50
But in the long run, Saha said, ““
The wind power industry, meanwhile, is largely supplied by domestically produced nacelles and towers that make up the majority of wind turbine costs, 10
Lithium-ion batteries are another story entirely. Last year, the Biden administration 7525
Though U.S. battery manufacturing has expanded dramatically in recent years, the overwhelming majority of lithium-ion batteries and components are still imported — and China supplied more than two-thirds of those imports last year, according to BloombergNEF.
Increased costs for lithium-ion batteries, components, and materials will ripple across the power sector. Automakers will be hit hard, too, since batteries are the most expensive parts of EVs.
Ever-cheaper lithium-ion batteries have become an important part of the power mix in states like California and Texas, where they’re shifting gigawatts of solar power from daytime to evening to mitigate grid stresses and take the place of fossil gas–fired generation.
The Biden administration set a lower tariff of 1020262560
Solar and batteries are the cheapest source of new grid capacity across most of the country and can’t be built fast enough to meet rising electricity demand from data centers, factories, electric vehicles, and general economic growth. Anything that makes those resources more expensive is almost certain to drive up electricity prices, said Michelle Solomon, a manager in the electricity program at think tank Energy Innovation.
“four-fifths of all new power construction expected in 2025, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. “
Tariffs will likely alter the equations for those projects, forcing storage developers to either absorb higher costs and accept lower profit margins or pass them through to counterparties, which could include utility customers.

All told, clean energy project costs are set to rise, said Rob Collier, senior vice president of marketplaces at LevelTen Energy. The company operates market platforms that allow project developers to craft power purchase agreements (PPAs) with companies and utilities seeking clean power.

That’s because it takes about three to five years to finance and build a factory — and companies need long-term certainty to make those investments, Saha said. Given the capricious nature of the Trump administration’s tariff policies to date, “
What’s more, the looming threat of a global recession weakens the case for investing in new manufacturing capacity: Why build a factory now if demand for your product could soon shrink?
““
In the meantime, tariffs are likely to drive up prices for U.S. manufacturers that rely on any foreign components, making their products “
That’s a particular threat for U.S. cleantech manufacturers.

Tariffs that drive up those input costs will hit nascent domestic cleantech manufacturers at a particularly precarious point of their development. Most of the facilities financed since the IRA

That increasing interest in erecting turbines in European waters helped buoy global investment figures. The offshore wind sector may be crumbling in the U.S. under Trump, but worldwide, it attracted more money in the first six months of this year than in all of last year.
Small-scale solar is also quickly gaining ground, especially in China, where investment in the energy source almost doubled even as funding for utility-scale solar fell by 28
Overall, the investment figures are trending in the right direction: up. But the growth remains sluggish compared to the blistering pace needed for the world to shift away from planet-warming fossil fuels.

The one caveat with food is that we stop taking what’s offered to us when we don’t enjoy it.

These days, Mayor Adams is best known as the trash-talking rogue who quit the Democratic Party after the Trump administration made his corruption charges disappear. But his main claim to fame used to be his plant-based diet, which he credited with helping him lose 35“

The hospital initiative is the centerpiece of New York’s efforts to reduce meat-eating, and Kate MacKenzie, executive director of the Mayor’s Office of Food Policy, says the default strategy is the key to driving change without provoking backlash. Most people like meat. They don’t want to be told to give it up to save the earth or even their health. But they’re not necessarily committed to eating it all the time, either. They’ll try what’s offered, if it sounds good, especially when they’re confined to a hospital bed.

This is the power of defaults: We’re much more likely to register to vote, sign up to be an organ donor, or renew our Netflix subscription when we have to opt out rather than opt in. Changing behaviors is hard, and we’ll have to change quite a few to maintain a habitable planet, so New York’s nudges could be a powerful model.

Mayor Adams embarked on his plant-based journey for health reasons, after he went nearly blind in one eye and his doctors told him he’d need diabetes drugs the rest of his life, so hospitals were the perfect venue to try to deploy his plant-based vision. But his food policy team is just as focused on climate. It’s set a goal of reducing the city’s food-related emissions by one-third by 2030

In small communities across North Carolina, data centers are already sparking conflict over land use, water use, and quality of life. Now, the debate over the facilities’ voracious need for electricity — and whether it can be met with clean sources — is heating up in the state capital of Raleigh.
For months, North Carolina’s predominant utility, Duke Energy, has forecast ballooning demand from large customers like data centers: immense buildings that house the computing devices powering AI
Early last year, Duke projected these “396

## The data center boom
In the race against other states to attract economic development, Duke and North Carolina officials keep confidential exactly which entities hope to draw power from the electric grid. And skeptics question whether all of the new facilities behind predictions of unprecedented demand growth will pan out.
But there’s little doubt that data centers are on the rise, propelled by the AI442028

What’s more, it bodes ill that last year’s much-vaunted agreement between Duke and data center giants to develop a clean transition tariff in the Carolinas appears to have fizzled: Despite promises otherwise, the utility has yet to request such a tariff.

Meanwhile, the commission’s perspective may be in flux. Unlike the panel that opened the docket in June, a majority of the body’s members are now appointed by Republicans, and it has elected a new chair. How regulators engage in this debate will become clearer when experts gather in October.

One of the biggest grid batteries in California almost resumed operations Sunday following the cataclysmic Moss Landing fire in January.
The San Francisco Bay Area’s power grid used to draw on two battery storage plants in the quiet seaside town of Moss Landing. Texas-based power company Vistra built the nation’s largest standalone grid battery on the grounds of an old gas power plant there, and utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co. built and owns the Elkhorn project next door.
A roaring fire engulfed Vistra’s historic turbine hall in January, wrecking rows of lithium-ion batteries that delivered 300PG&PG&

Had the operation succeeded, it would have returned 1825730
“PG&“
Indeed, California has been building grid batteries at a record pace, to store the state’s nation-leading solar generation and deliver it during crucial hours, like after sunset. The tech is displacing some gas-fired power generation in the state. California’s battery fleet passed 157“157 threshold merits particular attention, but it does mean California has added more than 5GWcrossed the 10 mark a year prior.
“
The state’s battery buildout is plowing ahead. But Vistra’s fiery failure sparked deep community concerns about battery safety in 600 battery in Morro Bay, two hours down the coast from Moss Landing, following significant local resistance
Even before the unsuccessful restart, the plan to revive Elkhorn had rekindled concerns among community leaders who are still grappling with the fallout from the largest-ever battery fire in the U.S., and quite possibly the world. The Monterey County Board of Supervisors had asked to keep both battery plants offline until the Vistra investigation was completed and acted upon.

That industry-wide preference for separate, containerized systems doesn’t eliminate the chance of battery fires, but it does limit the potential severity. One container might burn, but the fire can’t reach all the other batteries. A fire could knock a facility offline temporarily, but it would only eliminate a small percentage of its capacity, Murtishaw said. That stands in contrast to Moss Landing’s failure, or the all-or-nothing issues that can occur when a gas-burning turbine malfunctions.

To achieve that goal, the Moss Landing calamity needs to remain an outlier event. There’s good reason to believe that will be the case. For one thing, the industry has all but abandoned Vistra’s strategy of packing huge amounts of batteries into a single building.

Small-scale batteries in homes and businesses also count for California’s top-line storage goal. They depend on the same core battery technologies as the large-scale storage projects, but as mass-produced consumer items, they go through a different gauntlet of tests before they reach customers.

This article underscores both the promise and complexity of scaling up grid battery infrastructure in high-demand regions like California. While it's encouraging to see PG&E’s Elkhorn plant designed with improved safety spacing and containment measures, the setback from a single Megapack malfunction highlights how critical component-level reliability and thermal management remain for the sector.
As the state adds more battery capacity to support its clean energy goals, the quality and chemistry of core materials like electrolytes will become even more central to operational safety and performance. At Align Strategic Imperative, we recently explored these challenges in our research on the battery electrolyte market—a key enabler for the next generation of energy storage systems.
Events like the Moss Landing fire have intensified scrutiny on battery safety standards, and they also present an opportunity to accelerate innovation in safer electrolyte formulations, cooling systems, and modular designs. Looking ahead, aligning battery deployment with evolving community expectations and regulatory frameworks will be crucial for maintaining public trust and grid resilience.

President Donald Trump got his “
The One Big, Beautiful Bill Act is a law not of creation but destruction. It’s the antithesis of former President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better Act, which was ultimately pared down into the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022
It eliminates a set of subsidies that have, over decades, helped solar and wind mature from niche technologies to cornerstones of our power grid. It scraps tax credits for rooftop solar, electric vehicles, and heat pumps, making it more expensive for the average person to buy these cleaner options. It threatens to pull the rug out from under manufacturers who, encouraged by the incentives created by the Inflation Reduction Act, had chosen to build new factories to make products like solar panels and lithium-ion batteries in the United States.
Jobs will be lost. Energy will get even more expensive. Billions more tons of carbon dioxide
Though dozens of congressional Republicans voiced their support for various clean energy subsidies in recent months — and though Republican congressional districts benefit most from the manufacturing boom the incentives have created — Trump’s signature legislation ultimately faced almost no resistance. Browbeaten by the president, every GOPSen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who had announced his retirement days before.
## Progress made, progress lost?
In effect, the new law repeals much of the Inflation Reduction Act, a landmark law that was not only helping the United States reduce its carbon emissions, but also gave the country a much-needed injection of industrial policy. It was a rare, coherent attempt to marshal the might of the U.S. government to boost an industry — in this case, clean energy — deemed critical to national interests.
That policy was working.
After the law went into effect and introduced a new subsidy for clean-energy factories, the long-stagnant U.S. manufacturing and industrial base began to undergo a remarkable revitalization.
Firms 100EV115000new aluminum smelter in the U.S. in 45same program spurred plans for futuristic new steel plants that would operate without coal. The Trump administration dismantled that program in May, and the fate of those projects remains unclear.
The Inflation Reduction Act greatly accelerated the development of clean energy. This trend was underway before Biden’s law went into effect, thanks to a pair of tax credits, one of which dates back to George H. W. Bush’s administration and the other of which to the second term of George W. Bush. Biden’s signature climate law took these existing policies and expanded them, turbocharging the already-rapid rise of renewables. The results speak for themselves: As of last year the U.S. now gets more electricity from wind and solar than from coal. Big grid batteries have helped Texas and
Now, with the repeal of those and other incentives, it’s expected that the U.S. will plug somewhere between 5772nearly all new electricity capacity built in the U.S., it’s unclear what, if anything, would fill in that gap. It won’t be new gas-fueled plants — the energy inflation Americans are already dealing with.
The timing could not be worse. Around the country, demand for electricity is anticipated to grow at a pace not seen in years. One of the biggest drivers is the proliferation of data centers that underpin increasingly popular AIas much power as a small city. Making energy scarce right when it’s needed most will put even more upward pressure on power bills. And without abundant electricity, the U.S. will struggle to compete with China on AI
China already AI
## Big, beautiful contradictions
It’s difficult to square the destruction of these policies with Republicans’ stated priorities.

And yet the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act will essentially eliminate the only industrial policy the U.S. had in place to enable it to accomplish those goals.

Whatever the reason, the effect is clear. The U.S. under Trump has hitched itself to fossil fuels, to combustion, to literally ancient forms of energy that more forward-thinking countries will be leaving behind in the coming decades. For reasons economical as much as ecological, the future will be dictated by clean energy.

Disclaimer, I have rooftop solar under NEM 2.0 export tariff.
Regardless of how one sides on the ""Value of Solar"" discussion, I believe this bill should be modified further. I have no issue with removal of the carbon credits because I never expected them to be part of NEM 2.0, but the ability to pass along the benefits of NEM 2.0 on sale was an expectation of homeowners installing NEM 2.0, in some cases entering contracts.
1. The current bill will, at best, reduce the rates by just a bit. The Analysis from the Committee indicated that the large majority of the savings would come from the portion of the bill that was removed; quoting:
> $54.4 billion in savings through 2043 from the 10-year sunset provision; $2.5 billion in savings through 2043 from the home sale provision; and $1.1 billion reallocated through 2030 for the Climate Credit provision.2
1. Breaking a strongly held expectation will impact any participation of the public in future arrangementsload modifying

It's only a matter of time before the IOU's in CA are bankrupt. The State govt. has proven completely incompetent at seeing the big picture and are not prepared for what is coming just around the corner. The big 3 have pushed them around for years, but in the end, the customer will have the last say. As it is today their prices are 2x those in other states as well as 2x the price of the municipal utilities within the State.
It's just a matter of time at this point where competing solutions allow significant numbers of utility customers to go solar with battery storage. Removing NM 1.0 and 2.0 contracts only hastens existing customers to add battery storage. And for every additional customer that adds solar and storage, fewer kW's need be supplied by the Utility Company, forcing them to raise rates.
Solar and battery storage are not going away. They become more cost effective with each passing year. And the whole monopoly utility system cost structure is dependent on 100% participation, remove 5 or 10% of the customers and you'll find them in the catch 22 of increasing cost for remaining customers which results in further erosion of participation.
California has already passed that point, with about 15% of customers implementing behind the meter solar. And as a result, we've seen the response of the IOU's and the State accommodating all the rate increases they've requested.
Based on current political trends, with poor decisions being made at the State level in support of the IOU's the only solution in the near future will be State bailout. I'd estimate we might be there within the next 5 years, and certainly will if NM 1 and 2 contracts are broke. Certainly by 2040 the IOU's will be the last option of choice for customers, based on current price trends.
Even today, the reality is the only thing the utility offers at this point for a significant portion of customers is energy security: when a customers solar production is low, which in CA is typically winter months when a winter storm blows through. But today's new EV's are already capable of being used for backup / energy security, when solar panels are not enough.

Reneging on a contract is wrong and I'm sure will just waste money on litigation. I would like to see more support/incentives for household battery uptake.
Grid operators face a very serious operational challenge when confronted by unconstrained and uncontrollable input of power from distributed sources. Batteries can greatly ease this stress by balancing generation and load through time shifting. It should also reduce the extent of grid hardening to accomodate greater electric loads.
I think it would be fairer if I was charged a fixed fee to cover all of the connection infrastructure (grid) and a TOU fee for consumption and export. Everyone connected to the grid should cover the infrastructure cost. I'd guess a fair way might be to scale the annual connection fee per residence based on the maximum power passing through a residence's connection in either direction during a year. But great care must be taken by the regulatory agencies to prevent gold-plating of grid infrastructure because no business can be expected to ignore a taxpayer/customer guaranteed rate of return on capital expenditure.

I am on board with charging for maximum demand. That's how it works in Europe - there is a per-day fixed cost that depends on the demand.
Australia has a very large penetration of rooftop solar and they are ahead of California in trying to address this problem. They are currently trying two-way tariffs, and dynamic exports. In the first, the export rate and schedule is different to the inport rate and schedule. In the latter, a house cannot export if the grid believes it is not useful to the grid.
We could start by having a more rational TOU schedule. Right now we are paying less to import in the middle of the night, when the grid is very dirty, than at 4pm, when the grid is very clean.

It seems to me that this proposed legislation violates the Contracts Clause of the US Constitution, which provides that no state may pass any law that impairs existing contracts.
It's one thing to change the game for new solar customers. That's not good, but it's legal. It's another thing to retroactively change the terms of a contract signed long ago.
I'm surprised that the Legislative Counsel has not advised that this legislation is invalid on its face.

If the 3 investor-owned power utility companies (SDG&E, SCE & PG&E) were that altruistic they should agree in writing to lower rates for non-solar customers if this bill passes (or better yet, provide no interest loans to non-solar customers who want solar but can't afford the upfront cost), but they won't, because this is really about maintaining the exhorbitant salaries they pay their executives and the excessive 10+ percent profit margin they want when they really have a no-risk business because any losses (including those from wildfires) just get passed on to their customers. Investor-owned power utility companies were necessary at one time in this Country when large amounts of capital were needed to build power plants and expand transmission lines. But now that most of that infrastructure is built and rooftop solar can be generated at a small capital cost (rather than having to construct capital-intensive power plants), investor-owned power utility companies should be no different than other utilities, like water for example (think LA MWD).

If the energy companies are truly trying to save consumers money on electricity costs, and not just trying to increase profits, then why not set up a type of CO-OP where solar producers (ie homeowners or other businesses) could sell their excess energy production to other energy users? Yes, I would get less than my current retail rate, but more than the proposed wholesale rate. The energy purchasers would be getting a cheaper rate than the standard retail rate. Everybody wins.

I am probably in a tiny minority on this, but I think subsidizing solar in this matter is bad policy. I am in favor of renewable energy and I'm also against arbitrary Presidential/Executive branch actions, but subsidies like this end up with less solar than we would get by other means and therefore less relief for poor and under resourced communities who need coal plants and other large polluters to be reduced and eliminated rather than feel good solar panels that are over-subsidized. I'd rather see the resources go to reducing/eliminating the structural (or at least quasi-permanent) soft costs of solar, which make it more competitive with other forms of energy production (particularly those that are carbon intensive and typically afflicting poor communities).

After years of failed attempts, California lawmakers have cleared the way to create an electricity-trading market that would stretch across the U.S. West. Advocates say that could cut the region’s power costs by billions of dollars and support the growth of renewable energy. But opponents say it may make the state’s climate and clean-energy policies vulnerable to the Trump administration.
Those are the fault lines over “19CAISOcreate a shared day-ahead energy-trading regime.

But for advocates who’ve been working for more than a decade on plans for a West-wide regional energy market, it’s a momentous advance. “
Today, utilities across the Western U.S. trade energy via bilateral arrangements — a clunky and inefficient way to take advantage of cheaper or cleaner power available across an interconnected transmission grid.

That integrated market could create opportunities for solar power from California and the Southwest and wind power from the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest to be shared more efficiently, driving down energy costs and increasing reliability during extreme weather.

## What a Western energy market could achieve
The arguments for a day-ahead energy-trading market can be boiled down to a simple concept, Turner said — bigger is better. Being able to obtain power from across the region could reduce the amount of generation capacity that individual utilities have to build. And tapping into energy supplies spanning from the Pacific Ocean to the Rocky Mountains would allow states undergoing heat waves and winter storms to draw on power from parts of the region that aren’t under the same grid stress, improving resiliency against extreme weather.

California is planning on out-of-state geothermal and wind resources to meet its longer-term requirements for decarbonization of the grid. There are no planned transmission projects that can integrate these resources apart from SWIP-N (Idaho), TWE (Wyoming), and SunZia (New Mexico). The CAISO will need collaboration with other regional entities to determine mutually beneficial transmission solutions. The California legislation enabling a broader market should help foster regional cooperation.

The American solar manufacturing renaissance was charging ahead. Then President Donald Trump took the reins.
Since Trump resumed occupancy of the White House, promising to bring back manufacturing jobs, new investment in clean energy factories has plummeted from its Biden-era highs, and factory cancellations have surged instead. Now, with Trump’s signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this month, things are about to get even rockier for clean energy manufacturers — but several of the leading firms reshoring solar panel production still see reasons for qualified hope.
That’s not to say the path ahead will be easy. The law swings a battle-axe through the clean energy incentives that were carefully crafted by Democrats in the 2022disappear after 2027. Now, the U.S. will install somewhere between 20252035need vastly more electricity over that timeframe — not to mention the climate — but it also portends a shrinking market for American manufacturers to sell into.
““
But for manufacturers who have kickstarted a stunning reshoring of the solar supply chain after years of decline, the legislation’s final form is not nearly as dire as some earlier drafts. Chiefly, Republicans preserved the flagship manufacturing credit, which pays a company for each unit they make of key clean-energy components.
“CEO13“
The one major change the law did make to the manufacturing tax credit was to add in “FEOCFEOC
Take the case of T1120003FEOC“
““
Dean Solon, the billionaire solar entrepreneur who has manufactured connectors and cabling systems in Tennessee since the dawn of the modern solar industry, seemed unconcerned when I asked him in June about whether the new FEOC
“FEOC
For now, solar manufacturers that have factories operating or nearly operational can squint and see a good few years ahead while the tax credits are still accessible, though after that, it’s anybody’s guess. Companies that were about to commit to the multiyear effort to build new factories, however, just got an undeniable signal from Congress to take their jobs and economic dynamism elsewhere.
“
## Weathering slower solar demand
Somewhat improbably, Trump’s signature policy effort let the Biden-era 45 clean energy manufacturing credit continue as planned before phasing down after 20302033
Unlike the earlier House version, Gold noted, the law preserves transferability, which lets factories monetize their credits when they lack sufficient tax burden themselves; factories cost a lot up front before they start making money, so this is especially useful in their early years. Factories almost lost stackability, which guarantees credits for companies that produce several steps of the supply chain, but the final text preserved that, Gold added.
“45, which is what solar manufacturers do receive, it is exactly like what was included in the Inflation Reduction Act and proposed by Sen. Ossoff in the Build Back Better days,” Pochtaruk said.
That has direct implications for a solar cell factory Pochtaruk was developing somewhere in the U.S. but put on hold after the election as he waited to see if 45 would survive. Now that its fate is clear, Heliene can return to developing that factory, if the company determines it still makes sense in the new market landscape.
The major lingering concern for solar manufacturers is what happens next with their customers. The law, after all, attacks the demand-side credits that were designed to stimulate purchases of made-in-America solar products.
The early demise of the solar deployment credits will hit manufacturers in two major ways.
First, with the stroke of Trump’s pen, the amount of clean energy projects expected to come online in the U.S. over the next decade just dropped. Demand for the American factories that opened up to serve that market just took a commensurate hit. Americans pay a lot more for solar panels than the rest of the world, due to the trade protectionism in place to help factories here; thus, U.S.-made solar is for U.S. consumers, and can’t readily export to foreign markets if domestic demand suddenly drops.
Second, in destroying the solar deployment credits, Republicans also eliminated the domestic content adder, a bonus incentive that encouraged developers to pick domestic equipment over cheap imports.
““
Marta Stoepker, a spokesperson for Qcells, which runs the largest solar-module factory in the U.S., located in Dalton, Georgia, corroborated the importance of that policy for encouraging domestic purchases.
“
That said, the new megabill might leave a path for solar installations to continue at a healthy clip for the next five years. It’s the five years after that when solar could fall off a cliff.
Under the new law, solar developers need to start building their projects between now and July 420263020271FEOCIRS5
That timeline, then, could support something close to the recent high level of solar deployment into 203034T15
If the market follows the pattern from previous times Congress was set to end solar incentives, developers will rush to safe-harbor projects before the deadline, fast-tracking work that could have been spaced out over the next few years. Then they’ll have several more years to buy the rest of the project equipment, giving domestic factories more time to spin up.
Nonetheless, factories will have to navigate upheaval among their customers in the mad dash to lock in these incentives. Larger developers can afford to hustle and start a number of projects in the next year to secure the full tax credit. Smaller developers typically finish and sell projects to finance their next efforts, a strategy that could be foiled by this truncated timeline.
“
## Unknowns ahead: Political cudgels and the post-ITC era
Besides the impending blows to domestic demand, a few other variables could skew the fate of the solar manufacturing renaissance.
For one thing, manufacturers will have to navigate the new FEOC45 manufacturing credit. The firms who spoke with Canary Media said that, right now, doing so seems manageable, but a lot depends on how the final IRS. The Treasury Department has until the end of 2026
Despite the uncertainty, some are very confident they’ll make do.
““
Not everyone is so sanguine. One alarming scenario would be if the administration uses new FEOC
““
As if to underscore that exact point, the White House published an “
“IRS“
Should manufacturers make it through the near-term turbulence, they’ll still have to figure out what happens to the solar market after the current tax credit-fueled runway peters out around 2030
Over the last decade, solar tax credits have shown a Houdini-esque ability to bounce back from certain death through

Georgia Power, which expects a boom in power demand from data centers, says it needs to get a lot more electricity online — fast.
So what kind of power plants does the utility intend to rely on to accomplish this? It’s refusing to say, raising concerns that the state’s largest utility is trying to avoid public scrutiny of plans to build huge amounts of expensive, unnecessary, and polluting fossil-fueled infrastructure.

That worries environmental and consumer advocates as well as trade groups representing the tech giants whose data center plans are driving Georgia Power’s electricity needs to begin with.

But Georgia Power is already working on at least one large expansion of fossil-fueled power. In March, the utility applied for state permits to build four gas-fired turbines with a combined generation capacity of about 29GW
Grubb conceded in the hearing that the utility sought those permits in preparation for possibly building the gas-fired units, which aren’t mentioned in Georgia Power’s IRP

## Regulatory blind spots
Many states allow utilities to withhold details about the cost or type of resources in all-source RFPs to avoid undermining the competitive bidding process. But what’s uncommon about Georgia Power’s current case is just how much of its future will be dictated by this process.
Georgia Power’s need for new generation has exploded in the past two years, driven largely by a flood of plans to build data centers in the region. The utility has 2022

It could be a problem for utility customers, too, who have already seen rates rise significantly in recent years due to Georgia Power’s
Like most regulated utilities, Georgia Power earns a set rate of profit on investments in power plants, power grids, and other capital assets. It’s also required to allow third-party developers to compete with it to build solar and battery projects — a process that can yield lower costs for its customers but also lower rates of return for the utility.
Regulators have a responsibility to closely monitor the utility’s process for choosing which resources end up winning to ensure those decisions aren’t maximizing Georgia Power’s profits at the expense of its customers, said Patty Durand, a

Cutting fossil fuels out of transportation and buildings will mean embracing electric vehicles and equipping homes and offices with heat pumps. But cleaning up these sectors will take much more than tackling their energy supply — it’ll also require eliminating carbon emissions that come from producing the materials that roads and buildings are made of.
A growing number of states are starting to do just that, with policies that take a more holistic view of the climate challenge.
Nine states have enacted Buy Clean laws to boost demand for lower-carbon steel, concrete, asphalt, glass, and other industrial products. California 2017
““
The so-called 11
“
Until last month, the states working to shrink that policy gap had a powerful partner in the federal government.
The Biden administration launched the Federal-State Buy Clean Partnership in 2023
President Donald Trump has since abandoned the federal Buy Clean strategy and is attempting to rescind related grant programs. The about-face will undoubtedly delay a deep transformation of the country’s construction sector. But state agencies and industry associations say they’re forging ahead — guided by their own laws and commitments to slash embodied carbon.

The group is working to maintain collaboration among the 132017

## What it looks like to Buy Clean
The broader Buy Clean vision is to harness the government’s massive purchasing power to jump-start the private market for low-carbon industrial materials. Companies bidding to construct new public buildings or bridges must show they can not only compete on cost but also on the carbon intensity of their concrete or steel, which in turn creates demand for more cleanly produced products.
Today, states are largely still laying the foundation for this future reality.
The first place many agencies start is by requiring suppliers to furnish
In 2021
Waterstrat said her team has since developed specifications and language for companies to follow to ease the process of bidding on projects. Her office is also working on a database for EPDs to show the carbon intensity of the materials the state procures and to inform future policymaking. Eventually, the idea is to set limits around products’ carbon footprints — but for now, the state’s law doesn’t call for that.
““
A handful of states that are gathering EPDs also require construction products to meet certain emissions thresholds, which are known as global warming potential limits.

However, starting in 2027“
## Pressing on without a key partner
The ability to gather accurate data from many disparate suppliers is essential to achieving the ultimate goal of Buy Clean: slashing embodied carbon from construction materials.
That work will potentially get harder if the Trump administration succeeds in its attempts to claw back congressionally mandated climate and energy spending.

The office is also currently analyzing embodied-carbon data from state projects with the goal of identifying future pathways for reducing embodied carbon.

In New York and other Buy Clean states, program leaders said they’re still meeting quarterly through the climate alliance and trading notes to learn from each other’s experiences.

As electric and gas bills rise across the country, a poll released today finds that an overwhelming majority of people in the U.S. are concerned about growing energy costs — and experiencing greater financial stress because of them.
In a nationwide survey of about 20007363
The findings arrive as the Trump administration’s continued attacks on clean energy — and its support for coal and other fossil fuels — threaten to raise utility bills even higher, according to energy experts.
“
Yet according to the poll, most Americans aren’t familiar with the state entities in charge of regulating energy utilities and setting those prices: public utility commissions. That’s a problem, said Hua, because a lack of public participation prevents consumer interests from being fully considered when state regulators receive and approve rate-hike requests from utilities.
In the survey, 6090
Meanwhile, these relatively unknown regulators have approved ballooning utility cost increases in recent years. In 202244202397202520302021402019
The reasons behind these fast-rising rates vary by utility and state. Still, Hua singled out one driver of higher electricity rates in particular: utility spending on transmission lines and distribution systems — in other words, the poles, wires, and lines that deliver power to customers.
Utilities have spent increasing amounts of money to replace aging infrastructure and repair or harden the grid after storms, wildfires, and other disasters made more likely by climate change. State rules guarantee investor-owned utilities a rate of return on those investments, creating a financial incentive to overspend on grid infrastructure that some researchers have estimated costs consumers
The extent to which customers are suffering proves that the current regulatory system isn’t working, said Hua. “
Households that struggle to afford utilities often have no choice but to sacrifice needs like food, medicine, or basic physical comfort in order to pay their energy bills. Total utility bill debt in the U.S. has reached $17
Four in five respondents to the poll said they felt powerless to control increasing utility costs. Around 60
For that to change, public utility commissions need to better engage the communities they serve, said Hua.
They could, for example, hold public meetings virtually or at night so that more people can attend, he said. Commissions could also allow consumers to comment on regulatory proceedings online or in person, and could provide intervenor compensation that covers the legal fees of advocates and stakeholders so that more groups can get involved in ratemaking cases. Hua added that states should invest in expanding the staff and capacity of public utility commissions and consumer advocacy offices, which are often vastly out-resourced by large investor-owned utilities.
Other consumer advocates have called for a range of reforms to rein in high rates, such as implementing performance-based ratemaking, which rewards utilities for reaching certain environmental or equity goals. States could also prohibit utilities from charging customers for trade association and lobbying fees, and lower the rate of return utilities can earn on infrastructure investments.
Electricity and gas bills may rise even more under the Trump administration’s energy policies. Several reports have found that repealing the clean energy tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, which some GOPsignificantly raise household energy costs, given that solar and wind are now far cheaper sources of electricity than coal, oil, and gas. President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs — now aging, unprofitable coal power plants running would make energy costs even more unaffordable.
The administration has also targeted a popular federal assistance program that helps more than 6

Good article, like always.
The best way for consumers to address energy costs is to use distributed energy resources: solar panels and storage. These resources should be compensated properly by the regulators but, even if they are not, like with NBT in California, they help a lot with electricity bills. The biggest challenges are; cost of installation - should be no more than $2/watt, connection complexities - let's adopt collars and smart inverters, and lack of useful real estate, like shaded roofs, renters, or multi-family buildings. The latter could be solved with Community Solar.
Community Solar has had a bad history in California. The latest approach is AB-1260. Let's hope that will get through the legislature and that Newsom will not veto it.

It's my understanding that to bring more wind and solar power online, more and improved transmission lines are required. This article explicitly states that our rates are increasing because of the work being done on transmission lines. I am confused: how can wind and solar be least expensive form of grid energy if grid buildout to support wind and solar is what is causing our utility rates to go up so much? I would appreciate if Canary Media wrote an article that clarified the all-in $/KW cost comparison of, say, building a NG plant that requires no additional grid buildout vs a solar+storage that requires building new or upgraded transmission lines.

The plant, in the industrial port city of Kokkola, on Finland’s west coast, will soon receive gas shipments from a nearby liquefied natural gas import terminal and turn the fossil fuel into hydrogen. That in itself is not novel — pretty much all of the world’s commercially produced hydrogen comes from methane, the main ingredient in natural gas. But all those legacy hydrogen producers end up with carbon dioxide as a byproduct, and they vent it into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change. Hycamite will make hydrogen without releasing CO2, using a little-known process called methane pyrolysis.

Low-carbon hydrogen theoretically could clean up emissions-heavy activities like long-distance trucking, shipping, steel making, and refining — if anyone can manage to make it, at volume, at prices that compete with the dirty stuff that’s already available. In the U.S., some hydrogen producers and fossil fuel majors have talked about retrofitting carbon-capture machinery onto existing hydrogen plants, but nobody’s built a full-scale ““
Now President Donald Trump is treating Joe Biden’s suite of clean energy policies like a piñata, and it’s hard to tell if incentives for producing green hydrogen will even survive. That’s already scaring off investors from large, capital-intensive green hydrogen projects. But the up-and-coming pyrolysis crew could find a niche: Their projects are smaller and nimbler, and they consume natural gas, one sector that Trump has ordered his government to encourage.

Not only does methane-splitting require less energy, it can be done with a simpler plant design than water electrolysis, using fewer moving parts or fragile pieces of equipment, Singhania noted. This
Those thermodynamic advantages come with tradeoffs. Namely, would-be methane pyrolyzers need a ready source of methane, which in practical terms means a pipe delivering fossil gas. That inevitably entails some level of upstream emissions.
Methane pyrolyzers also need to be located where gas is abundant. It’d be hard to scale up in places like Europe, post Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, or
Right after taking office in January, Trump responded to world records in U.S. fossil fuel production by declaring an
It’s not clear whether the fossil fuel industry can or wishes to increase production dramatically; in market-based systems, excess supply tends to deflate prices. Whether production stays at current record highs or pushes further skyward, the U.S. will have plenty of gas to go around, and methane pyrolysis companies could generate the kind of new demand that the industry desperately needs. Moreover, they would be using American fossil fuel abundance to create materials useful for the transition to clean energy.
For that to happen, though, pyrolysis startups need to break through early technical demonstrations and start producing at scale.
## Out of the lab and into the fray
Hycamite is not the only company chasing the pyrolysis dream.
The American startup
Monolith received a conditional $1 in late 2021DOEtire for electric vehicles
However, Monolith did not finalize the loan before the Trump administration came to office and froze new disbursements for clean energy. The company was running short on cash while struggling to get its high-heat process to work reliably around the clock, per a Wall Street Journal
Several other startups want to boost their revenues by turning methane into higher-value forms of carbon than carbon black, a relatively inexpensive commodity — if they can achieve the quality and consistency necessary to sell into those specialized and demanding markets.
A group of Cambridge University scientists founded 20122004
Levidian eschews the catalysts, heat, and pressure that other startups use to split methane. Instead, the team ended up building a nozzle that sucks in methane gas, then uses electricity to generate microwave energy, which in turn creates a cold plasma torch that shaves carbon atoms from hydrogen atoms.
This yields hydrogen and graphene, which can be used in semiconductors, electronics, and batteries. Levidian can sell graphene for hundreds of dollars per kilogram, far more than carbon black, CEO24
“
U.S.-based
The Etch team is wrapping up commissioning for its first “CEOactually producing low-carbon hydrogen at scale, and a key player in six of the seven hydrogen hubs funded by the Department of Energy.
## Steps toward scale in uncertain times
All these companies need to hit their stride just as the clean hydrogen market has entered a period of tumult.
The Biden administration hoped to jump-start a clean hydrogen economy with two major policies: A suite of billion-dollar grants to seven “ strategically chosen around the country, which are intended to link up production with entities that could use the fuel to clean up transportation and heavy industry, and a production tax credit to effectively lower the market price of hydrogen produced using low-carbon methods.
Now, the Trump administration has frozen payments on clean energy grants and loans. Prospective hydrogen producers had been waiting breathlessly for the final IRS45 tax credit; now that the lawyers have finally produced that guidance, the nascent hydrogen industry has to plead with the new administration to preserve those credits as it overhauls federal spending this year.
Given this swirling uncertainty, pyrolysis startups can take some solace in the fact that their business is not entirely dependent on the vagaries of hydrogen policy. At least they can sell carbon materials, which have clear value and established buyers who use the stuff in a non-theoretical way.
I asked Malkamäki if Hycamite identifies as a carbon company that also makes hydrogen or a hydrogen company that also makes carbon. He pointed out that the company name itself is a mashup of ““““
That’s not to suggest breaking into the battery supply chain will be easy. It requires passing rigorous, multi-year testing by the battery makers that might buy Hycamite’s carbon products. But this kind of revenue can bolster a young business as it rides out the storm in Washington.

Great article, thank you. It's terrible that these NOAA researchers were purged, but this article's description of their work suggests that it's possible that some offshore wind might harm whales, rather than its being a ""false premise.""
Reading p. 264-265 of ""Residency, demographics, and movement patterns of North Atlantic right whales..."" by Quintana-Rizzo, Leiter et. al (2021) in Endangered Species Research
Science is slow, and it can take a while for long-suspected connections to be definitively proven or dismissed, so I don't like it when advocates of any issue imply that just because ""is harmful"" isn't proven, then ""might be harmful"" should not be a concern.
I love both offshore wind and whales, and would love to learn more about their interaction, what we know and don't know, in the nuanced reality between political polarizations.

A recent pact between North Dakota and the Trump administration shows how coal-friendly states could enshrine lax standards and block future federal enforcement on toxic coal ash pollution.
North Dakota earned preliminary approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last month to regulate coal ash — a byproduct of burning coal — at the state instead of federal level. Indiana environmentalists fear that their state will follow the same path.

Just under three years ago, the Inflation Reduction Act went into law and generated tens of billions of dollars’ worth of investment in domestic manufacturing of clean energy technologies. President Donald Trump has turned that wave into a ripple.
Since Trump took office in late January, companies have paused, canceled, or shuttered 2627619000
Over that same time period, 293
Under the Biden administration, companies pledged well over $100 in factory investment, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act’s incentives for manufacturers and for project developers and people to buy American-made solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles, and more. The cleantech manufacturing surge was so significant that it pushed overall
Areas represented by Republicans in Congress stand to gain the most from this factory boom. More than 80flow to Republican-led districts; over 70
But under Trump’s new “, the future of those projects is less certain.
The law did not repeal tax credits for most clean-energy manufacturers, but it will eat away at their customer base by scrapping subsidies for wind and solar developers. It also introduced strict anti-China stipulations to the manufacturing tax credit, which could be a headache for companies to comply with, depending on how the Treasury Department decides to enforce the rules.
These factors, in addition to the increasingly volatile business environment in the U.S., do not bode well for the clean-energy manufacturing boom regaining momentum in the near term. Nor do Trump’s beloved tariffs hold much promise as a way forward. Previous attempts to boost domestic solar-panel manufacturing via tariffs alone have failed, and
That’s not to say cleantech manufacturing is now a lost cause in the U.S. — some solar producers, for example, are feeling optimistic. But what’s increasingly clear is that the short-lived boom times are over, and any manufacturing success stories from this point on will be in spite of the federal government rather than because of its generous support.

The Piedmont Environmental Council recently installed 42 solar panels at its community farm in Loudoun County, Virginia, where it will test the impact on crops. (Hugh Kenny/Piedmont Environmental Council)
More than a decade ago, residents of Loudoun County, Virginia, banded together to buy up treasured open space before it became a strip mall and housing development, donating the land to the Piedmont Environmental Council instead. The nonprofit has maintained it as a unique blend of cattle pasture, a nature preserve, and a community farm that donates its yield to a local food pantry.
Now, a small corner of the farm has become what organizers say is a first for the state: a crop-based agrivoltaics demonstration project. They hope the combination of solar panels and vegetable farming will showcase how much-needed renewable energy can complement, not harm, agricultural lands, at a time when data centers are demanding more and more electricity.
The Virginia Clean Economy Act requires the state’s largest utility, Dominion Energy, to stop burning fossil fuels by 2045161002035
Virginia has more than enough room to meet that target without threatening great swaths of farmland. Using a conservative metric that 101402“
Researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University determined that large-scale solar today is erected on “203512“
In fact, many landowners find that renting a portion of their land to solar companies can help their farming enterprise pencil out financially, reducing pressure to sell their property to developers. An acre of land, after all, may yield hundreds of dollars if devoted to crops but thousands if leased for panels.
And yet there’s no doubt that solar has grown exponentially in the state in the last decade, and that it has disproportionately displaced farmland. Cropland makes up 528

Agrivoltaics — the awkward portmanteau of agriculture and solar photovoltaics — has emerged as a potential solution, wherein farmland is kept in production even while it hosts solar arrays. The most common application is sheep: They graze on vegetation beneath the panels and prevent the need for expensive and polluting mowers. Planting flowers in and around panels to supply honeybees and other pollinators is also popular.
Still, the Piedmont Environmental Council team wanted to experiment with a crop-based model because it fits better with what most farmers in the area are doing now: raising vegetables.

The array will supply more than enough power to meet the farm’s needs, with additional headroom for a planned EV
With the shade and protection from rainwater that they provide, how do the solar panels affect soil moisture and temperature? What’s the resulting crop yield? What do vegetables grown beneath and near solar panels look like, and how will consumers react? Do any contents from the panels make their way into the crops, posing health problems?
Most research has found that the answer to the last question is no. But the team still plans to test for contaminants in response to public concern as a show of good faith and transparency, and in an effort to address any potential barriers to agrivoltaics from the get-go.
While most crop-based agrivoltaics projects involve growing produce in the ground, the Piedmont Environmental Council’s farm also includes raised beds, which enable educational tours and widen the demonstration project’s relevance.
The beds do increase costs, said Pitsiokos. But the rationale for them, he said, ““

Hi,
I never comment on articles because I usually don't value the opinions of others who do because those opinions are usually uninformed. However, I own a solar company and hope to one day build agrivoltaic arrays (NOT an awkward portmanteau), and I find the design of this experiment to leave a few things to be desired.
First, to produce valuable data, I feel they need to start with the irradiance the ground will receive over the course of a day based on the density of shade the panels will create--taking license with the word, ""opacity,"" delineate a plane above a field and think of it as the ""irradiance control plane."" Use the properties of solar panels and arrays thereof to calculate/estimate the irradiance and/or density of photons (light and thermal, if possible) that will reach the soil. Factors to consider include the translucence of a panel's backing sheet--clear, white, or black; then, the spacing of the panels, both laterally in a row and between rows. Consider if they are mounted right next to one another as in a residential roof array, 6"" apart, 12"" apart, 2', 3', 4', up to whatever spacing is the equivalent of having no shade whatsoever. I'm guessing a version of a checkerboard pattern will find its way into use. Connect this analysis with the shade tolerance of various crops.
The methodology to capture this data MUST take into account the types of machines used to work the land to till, sow, irrigate, spray, and harvest the crop itself. No one is going to buy all new tractors just to accommodate a solar array that can take any form required to accommodate existing farm equipment. Figure that the panels will be higher off the ground than typical ground mounts, but that foundations, anchors, and panel-stowing hardware can be designed to handle wind uplift and snow loads. Also consider that the dimensions of panels could be changed by a manufacturer to affect the nature of the shade they will create. Similarly, perhaps the arrays themselves could be mobile/designed to be moved every so many years as part of crop rotation cycles.
Also, see if the analysis can account for the capabilities solar support structures can introduce to meet existing agricultural production needs: irrigation lines can be installed from overhead structures and might use less water than existing sprinkler methods, as mentioned in the article, the shade from the panels might reduce water use, and perhaps, the irrigation system could be designed to include sprayer heads that would clean the panels to boost electricity production at the same time that crops are being irrigated.
The essential data point to capture is making 100% certain that NO chemicals, metals, or other compounds are leeching from the panels or any component of the system. No one will want to eat food grown underneath them otherwise. Beyond that, water needs, soil moisture, soil temperature, degree of protection from heavy rain, UV damage, and stress from heat waves; crop yield, and power yield from the panels are also important.
Thank you for taking the time to consider this comment.

This is a great program, that can have such a huge impact on neighborhoods. It gets people talking about neighborhood issues, and even their part in the need to reduce energy consumption. Having run a similar program in CA in the 1990s and early 2000s, I can tell you that it really works to begin to connect people to things like weatherization programs, and neighborhood crime issues. As for over-lighting the neighborhoods, our program was for porch lighting, meaning most of the fixtures were under porch roofs, and had reflectors that directed the lighting downward, onto pathways, not up to the sky. if they are going to have their porch light on, better it be an energy efficient model.

The pace and scale of those investments put the Austin, Texas–based firm in a league of its own among clean energy startups this year — beating out even the outlandish $863 that Commonwealth Fusion Systems raised in August.

““
The U.S. is going through the fastest electricity demand growth in decades, as AI“
The key to Base Power’s model is finding households in Texas who want cheap electricity with the benefit of backup power. The company becomes their retail power provider and installs one or two unusually large batteries on-site. Base owns the batteries, and the customers pay an installation fee starting at $695
The batteries earn money through simple arbitrage: They charge up when wind or solar production pushes prices down and then discharge when demand and prices spike. Base Power also earned certification to deliver ancillary services, which are rapid-fire adjustments to maintain grid reliability, for which batteries are uniquely suited. The company has already maxed out the 20
Base Power has begun selling its services to regulated utilities so that they can help their customers with backup power and free up more grid capacity. And Dell is scoping out other geographical markets where the rules could allow the Base Power model to grow. But for now, Texas is the ideal place to start. It not only has the competitive market run by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT

So this is a more remarkable article than it even first appears. Base Power raised private investments to expand a virtual power plant in Texas by arbitraging price differences between daytime and early evening/evening prices. And yet California is squawking about the need for more subsidies to do the same. Is it really as simple as a different regulatory environment and pricing models? Can Hawaii and California move closer to a Texas style structure? If not, why not, but if so, how?

Now that solar combined with batteries are more cost effective / efficient than natural gas, the huge subsidies aren't needed. I believe I read here at Canary that about 99% of all new power to come on line in the US last year was green. It is unlikely that that will change significantly, without the subsidies because they just aren't needed - or at the least, are barely needed compared to five or ten years ago, when solar panels were noticeably less efficient, and grid batteries which dramatically improve reliability of power, basically didn't exist.
Plus we have the non-utility private sector almost exclusively planning green power for data centers, and AI.
And without the heavy subsidies we'll also end up with less boondoggles - wasted billions. The poster child for that waste is the Ivanpah, on the CA/NV border. Its mirrored oil heating solar system (no solar panels) was marginally efficient when completed just over 10 years, ago, but now is far, far, more expensive per KW than anything new. Looks like it will be shuttered before it even reaches half of it's minimum life expectancy when built, because the utilities can't afford to pay that much for electric, when new solar is half the price or less.
At least a traditional solar farm could easily replace aging less efficient solar panels with newer ones. But Ivanpah, also excellent at killing wild life including eagles, has proven to be a terrible investment. This is exactly the kind of thing that can happen when the government throws money out in large quantities as subsidies. ""Everything looks great"" until reality sets in.
Anyone think new solar installations aren't going to soar in 2025? Wind is another issue. I'm not opposed to wind, although it seems today that while well placed wind farms do cost less than solar, wind isn't likely to keep becoming more efficient whereas solar panels keep improving. There are other solutions, I think that may be better long term than wind turbines (also bird killers). True that in the US wind farms only kill about 1.5 million birds a year, we've barely begun to build out wind, relative to the potential if the US wants to stick with wind.
I am more hopeful for tidal power, which we haven't mastered yet, but would seem to end up being far more efficient than wind? Not sure about that, but water/tides will can push turbines a lot harder than wind. Test it. point a large fan at your face. Windy. Now instead point your garden hose at your face. Now that's magnitudes more power hitting your face, or spinning turbines.
Imagine what a series of giant sea floor mounted turbines could generate if placed in a line between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean, with the massive tides spinning those underwater blades. We may not be there yet, but it's possible that such tech could make wind farms obsolete in 10 years +/-.
No matter what the current administration does, the bottom line is green is now more efficient than fossil fuels and demand for electricity is rising, and it's just about all going to be green.
And let's not forget that the states (ie CA) can pick up some of the slack from lost subsidies from the Feds. Finally, I didn't like the chart, because it shows numbers based on Biden's massive, over the top spending, (ie IRA) which is why we are running unsustainable $1.5 Trillion dollar federal deficits. Better would have been a chart showing spending over the past decade, for a better look at what might be sustainable spending.

It’s become the animating question in the U.S. electricity industry: How can power-hungry data centers get the energy they need?
The obvious answers have proven insufficient. Solar and wind power projects face yearslong wait times to interconnect to constrained grids. Moves to siphon off existing nuclear power to avoid these grid bottlenecks have proven controversial. And building new fossil gas–fired power plants will not only worsen climate change but may simply be impossible on the timeline that data centers require given
But there may be faster and cheaper ways to bring lots of clean energy online to match new data center demand — it just requires some creative thinking.
One idea is to couple new clean power with some of the dirtier, if only rarely used, fossil-fuel power plants already connected to the grid — an approach that, counterintuitively enough, could end up not just faster but cleaner than alternatives.
That’s the proposition think tank RMI““
The biggest data centers now being planned across the country by tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft can use hundreds of megawatts to gigawatts of electricity. In some of the country’s biggest data center hot spots, there simply isn’t enough capacity left to connect that much new load right now.
But in the “RMI“
That could also allow new large-scale clean power projects to connect directly to the data center. Some of those solar, wind, and battery developments are already permitted and awaiting grid interconnection — and all of them can be built much faster than new gas-fired power plants, according to industry experts. Allowing some of these projects to avoid the interconnection backlogs and grid upgrade costs would get clean power online much faster.
Of course, few if any data centers can rely solely on the sun and wind to serve their round-the-clock power needs, even with batteries to store some of that power for when demand is highest. That’s where the peaker plant comes in, Varadarajan said.
Peaker plants can serve as a circuit breaker of sorts between the grid on one side and the new data center and all its clean power and batteries on the other side. When there’s not enough clean power for the data center, “
!Diagram of power flows between clean energy, data center, gas-fired peaker plant and power grid in a 'power couple' site RMI
In that sense, the peaker plants are more like gas-fired backups for a largely clean power mix. It’s a natural fit: Peaker plants are designed to fire up only when the grid really needs them, largely during summer heat waves or winter cold snaps when demand for electricity peaks (
That leaves a lot of hours when those plants aren’t using their connections to the grid at large — which creates an opening for clean power to use them, Varadarajan said. Developers will probably want to “
Importantly, from the perspective of a utility or grid operator, this setup is potentially far less disruptive than adding a big new load or trying to interconnect a brand-new source of generation, Varadarajan said. Many U.S. grid operators already have rules to allow sites that have grid connections to add different types of generation capacity or to use a power plant’s existing capacity more frequently.
And because the data centers will have all the power they need behind the interconnection point, power couples won’t have to enter the complicated technical and regulatory realm of projects that both inject and draw power from the grid — a status that can “

Those prices are higher than what data center developers might expect to secure from utilities with low-cost power, ample grid capacity, and an eagerness for the economic development such customers could bring. They’re also higher than
But for the tech giants and data center developers competing for scarce space on crowded grids, price could no longer be as significant as being able to get power quickly. Industry analysts have calculated that Microsoft may be offering

Even at higher prices, solar and wind power that flows directly to data centers could be attractive for tech companies like Google and Microsoft that are striving to achieve 247. “
## Other ways to get clean power built faster
In fact, the concept laid out in RMITPGplan to invest $202030 in newly built wind, solar, and batteries to mostly power new data centers.
Intersect Power CEO
Intersect Power has proposed building its own gas-fired generation instead of relying on existing peaker plants. Whatever the fossil-fuel backup source, Kimber told Canary Media that parts of the country with good solar and wind resources can probably power a big load like a data center with electricity that’s carbon-free about 80
A power couple also looks something like the “
For clean energy developers, the ability to secure a major customer and avoid grid interconnection wait times and grid upgrade cost uncertainties takes away a lot of risk, said Eric Gimon, Energy Innovation policy adviser and a co-author of the group’s recent report. “
That’s not to say that current regulations make these kinds of projects easy. It’s probably simplest in Texas, where a deregulated energy regime has allowed clean energy and batteries to thrive. That’s where Google and Intersect Power are planning their first projects.
The situation is more mixed in other parts of the country, depending on the rules that apply. For example, “
But PJM6513recently started amending its regulatory regimes to allow this surplus interconnection option in ways that energy developers say they can work with.
In many parts of the country where utilities retain monopolies over the right to build generation, operate power grids, and sell electricity to all customers in their service territories, pathways for other companies to build and own clean energy remain largely untested.
But those “
Peskoe co-wrote a
Energy parks could help insulate everyday customers from these potential rate hikes, he wrote, since only the companies building the data center and the new generation would be responsible for the costs involved. But for that to happen, state lawmakers will have to make these arrangements legal.
Or utilities could build power couples themselves. RMIPJM
The technical potential for using existing grid connections to boost clean power capacity is enormous. A 700
To be sure, that’s a theoretical maximum that’s almost certain to remain unrealized due to real-world constraints and basic energy economics. “10
That won’t be simple to achieve. One early hurdle is setting up the contractual structures between existing power plant owners and the developers of data centers and clean energy, O’Connell said. Even when those are done, conflicts could arise between power-couple project partners and incumbent generators, transmission grid owners, and utilities.

Ohio legislators are considering bills that would bar local governments from having a say in permitting projects that capture carbon dioxide emissions and inject them underground. The legislation could even force some landowners to let their property be used for carbon dioxide storage.
The framework proposed in the twin bills being considered by the state House and Senate starkly contrasts with Ohio’s approach to wind and solar farms, most of which can be blocked by counties.
Instead, carbon capture and storage projects would follow a process similar to what’s used for oil and gas drilling, in which property owners must allow development on or below their land if enough neighbors support it.
At least one large energy company, Tenaska, is already talking to Ohio landowners about obtaining rights to drill wells and store carbon dioxide from industrial and energy operations deep underground. An executive with the firm said the legislation would provide “
“
The company is in discussions with various carbon-emitting businesses, including steel refineries, ethanol plants, and power plants. The
In Ohio, Tenaska is eyeing CO2 underground. The three counties are among the state’s top oil and gas producers and have a history of coal mining. Tenaska initially hopes to store captured carbon dioxide in the Knox formation, which ranges from 85001200055008000
Other carbon sequestration projects could be on the horizon. The Great Plains Institute has identified roughly three dozen industrial facilities across the state as
Ohio’s “local government regulation of drilling, even through general zoning rules that apply to other businesses.
If passed, the bills would similarly deprive counties and townships of any say over sequestration, said Bev Reed, an organizer for the Buckeye Environmental Network. “
The bills would also authorize a ““70unitization, which lets oil and gas companies drill through dissenting landowners’ properties.
The chief of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources’ oil and gas management division would be required to grant consolidation if it was ““
““
Asked to respond to advocacy groups’ complaints that the process is unfair, Tenaska’s Kairys focused instead on landowners’ potential for income.
““
The bills call for compensation, but it’s subject to adjustments for the developer’s expenses. Companies in oil and gas unitization cases often get to recoup twice their costs before they have to pay landowners more than the law’s minimum 125HB170SB136
The bills are currently in the House Natural Resources Committee and the Senate Energy Committee. Primary sponsors are all Republicans: Sen. Tim Schaffer, Sen. Brian Chavez, Rep. Bob Peterson, and Rep. Monica Robb Blasdel.
““
Critics have dozens of questions, including whether sequestration projects make economic sense and whether they will significantly reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.
“CO2 and injecting it underground, she noted.
Other questions deal with feared drops in property values, chemicals used in the carbon sequestration process, and the huge amounts of water that carbon capture technologies require.
People also worry about the potential for carbon dioxide to escape from underground storage or related pipelines, said Randi Pokladnik, an environmental scientist and volunteer for Save Ohio Parks.
Tenaska’s project will include a detailed emergency response plan, Kairys said, adding that carbon dioxide is not flammable. “
Dozens of people were hospitalized in 2020
Companies have injected carbon dioxide underground for years to stimulate extra production from oil and gas wells, but it has never been done at the large scale proposed now, Pokladnik said. She worries that gas could migrate upward through fractures in overlying rock layers or other wells, including many old, abandoned oil wells whose locations may be unknown.

Two years after the last attempt to build out wind farms in Maine’s northern reaches fizzled, the state is again gearing up to seek developers to build at least 1200ISO
For wind power advocates, these moves have sparked hope that a new source of renewable energy may finally be developed in the region.

Maine and most of its neighboring states have ambitious emissions-reduction targets: Maine just adopted legislation calling for 10020402050roadblocks to offshore wind development, it becomes even more important to tap into land-based wind to keep progressing toward a cleaner energy future, supporters said.
““
Plans to build onshore wind in northern Maine’s remote Aroostook County have come and gone several times over the past two decades. In 20082000MW20153000MW20201139MW
Aroostook County — with its strong winds and low population density — has long been considered a prime area for building turbines, but its promise has not been realized. One of the major obstacles has been the lack of transmission lines to carry power from the forests of northern Maine to the lightbulbs and dishwashers of Massachusetts and Connecticut. Most of Aroostook County is served by an electrical system connected only to Canada, with no direct links to any U.S. power grid. Building the needed lines is a complex, costly undertaking that has repeatedly stymied efforts to get wind generation up and spinning.

Now the state has gone back to the drawing board. This time around, however, the plans are getting an unprecedented boost from ISO2026
Meanwhile Maine utilities regulators released a request for information to collect feedback from developers, industry members, and other stakeholders to help plan and schedule its next procurement. There has been a robust response to the request, though most comments were filed confidentially, said Susan Faloon, spokesperson for the Maine Public Utilities Commission. The tentative plan is to open up for proposals by the end of the year, she said.
Whether the next attempt will be successful hinges on a few factors, starting with its ability to financially weather Republicans’ scaleback of federal clean-energy tax credits and the administration’s continued, evolving hostility to renewable energy projects. Trump halted federal permitting and leasing for wind projects on his first day in office, and although 99
“
Still, Pullaro said, history suggests that onshore wind development could survive the blow of losing federal support. The grid needs more energy, and land-based wind is one of the least expensive power sources to build, even without incentives, while the cost of new natural gas generation is going up, according to a
“
Tweaks to the state’s timeline for issuing a request for proposals and choosing a project could also increase the likelihood of success, Pullaro said. A wind development stands a much better chance of succeeding, he said, if another state commits to buying power from it, giving it a revenue stream it can count on. Getting Massachusetts on board could be even more crucial than federal support, he said.
Massachusetts is still authorized to enter into another such agreement until the end of the year, and Gov. Maura Healey (D) included in a supplemental budget bill a provision that would extend this authorization to 202720252026

President Donald Trump’s crusade against wind energy is intensifying — and it could come with some serious costs.
As much as $317790213
To be clear, those figures represent the high end of what’s at stake — they’re based on what’s currently in the interconnection queue, and projects drop out of that process all the time for various reasons.
But if even a fraction of that investment is canceled or delayed, it will be painful for the regions that miss out on the tax revenue and jobs, with Texas, Illinois, and New Jersey standing to lose the most.
It would also be bad timing: Electricity demand is on the rise nationwide, largely due to the boom in AI. Delaying or blocking the buildout of gigawatts worth of wind projects when the U.S. is in the midst of an energy-supply crunch would drive up already-climbing power bills. Wind produced just over 10
And, of course, any slowdown in the construction of clean energy is a setback for efforts to transition the U.S. away from fossil fuels, a task that grows more urgent with the passage of every hot summer day.

Trump's vendetta against renewable energy, particularly wind power, is sourced from his case of the terrible twos that wind turbines off shore in the North Sea, in his opinion ruined the view from his golf course in Scotland. Somehow that isn't even surprising.

LASVEGASRE
The Trump administration had declared an energy emergency, then set about reducing energy supply by going after renewables projects. The massive spending law yanked nearly seven years of tax credits for wind and solar. The White House arbitrarily halted construction on two major offshore wind farms that had all their permits in order, raising the fear that it might block other fully approved projects. Tariffs have changed the price of parts that go into clean energy equipment on a sometimes weekly basis. The cleantech bankruptcies have been relentless: Powin, Sunnova, Mosaic, Li-Cycle,
“CEO
But when I got to the exhibit hall at the Venetian Expo, it stretched farther than I’d ever seen at a clean energy show, and I heard rumors of additional halls above and below. The exhibitors even sprawled across a sunwashed bridge to Caesar’s Forum, where vendors of flow batteries and other alternative technologies hawked their wares, quite fittingly, from the periphery of the event.
Final attendance for the show hit 3700040000
“RE“
Judging by this year’s dire headlines, the show’s ebullient atmosphere does not seem entirely rational. Of course, even teetering startups try to project confidence among peers, customers, and especially journalists. And the overstimulated Vegas backdrop inspires a particular strain of optimism, the kind that encourages you to light cash on fire and feel lucky for the opportunity.
But after three days of roaming the frenetic halls, I came to see this year’s positive outlook as warranted. The general consensus among conference goers seemed to be that though political headwinds are blowing hard, economic tailwinds are blowing harder. Here are three reasons why I think they are right.
## Forget policy, look at the markets
With the federal tax credits cut short, fewer solar projects will get built, and costs will rise for the ones that still go forward, passing on higher energy bills to American consumers.
But, with a little distance from the sting of this summer’s legislative setbacks, many solar and energy storage professionals believe losses in the policy arena are counterbalanced by increasingly rosy outlooks in the marketplace.
“CEOclean energy financing platform Crux, as we sipped espressos outside the hubbub of the cavernous expo halls.
Johnson’s company launched as a marketplace for tax credit transferability, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act, but has expanded into other forms of financing, like debt and tax equity. That perch gives him visibility into clean energy project economics and the flows of capital into the sector. He ticked off a series of key factors defining the current energy market: Electricity prices are way up; solar and battery keeps getting cheaper while improving performance; gas prices are rising as the Trump administration promotes exports; gas turbine prices are rising due to intense competition from buyers.
In short, it’s a bad time to be someone who uses electricity in America, despite President Donald Trump’s campaign promise to cut energy prices. That means, though, that it’s a great time to be someone who sells power.
Even better for power producers, the biggest new customers — data centers — have the price sensitivity of a ravenous grizzly bear. They’re trying, with the enthusiastic support of the White House, to win a global arms race to unlock artificial superintelligence, whatever that means. Facing such civilizational stakes, the hyperscalers aren’t going to quibble over nickels and dimes.
Even with elevated electricity prices, hyperscalers still have to pay a lot more for the “AI
“
Solar is clearly the cheapest source of new electricity production. But what matters most now is speed to market, and here solar and batteries easily trounce all other commercially viable sources of power. Taking mass-produced panels and parts and assembling them in a field is fundamentally easier than constructing a traditional large power plant. And it’s a hell of a lot easier than some of the hyperscalers’ other ideas, like building nonexistent nuclear fusion plants, or nonexistent small modular reactors, or restarting a long-shuttered nuclear reactor at the notorious Three Mile Island plant.
These dynamics led some of my fellow conference goers to muse about a counterfactual choice: Would you rather have strong federal policy tailwinds and an unfavorable market, or booming market fundamentals but unfavorable policy? Nine months ago, the industry enjoyed both. Trump ended those good times, but the robust market serves to mollify the pain of his policy attacks.
## Solar got whacked, but storage is booming
SEIAfriendly fire from states like California, and large-scale developers are racing to cram in a bumper crop of projects before tax credits disappear next July. (Projects that start construction after that must be operating by the end of 2027
““IRA
The budget law preserves the battery-installation tax credits through 2033sparked initial concerns from some analysts that these Foreign Entity of Concern rules (FEOC
A few months later, many storage developers are encouraged by how clearly the text of the law lays out the boxes to check. Even so, compliance creates extra work for the American companies trying to expand the capacity of the grid, and the law does not explicitly encourage domestic manufacturing, since the rules are anti-China rather than pro-America.
Trump’s tariffs also pose a unique threat to storage, because so many of the battery cells used in these projects come from China. The U.S. has only just begun building supply chains for lithium ferrous phosphate, the battery chemistry now favored for grid storage. LGLFP in Michigan this summer; AESCTesla is working on one in Nevada slated to start up early next year.
Now, said Brian Hayes, CEOFEOCFEOC
“40580“
That’s not to say storage developers can afford to get complacent.
““
## Domestic supply chains are developing in spite of the chaos
The Biden administration combined trade policy with methodical domestic incentives to reshore the manufacturing of clean energy equipment and other tech, like semiconductors. Trump supports the resurgence of domestic manufacturing in theory, but his primary tactic for that goal has been frequently shifting and legally dubious tariffs. These policies raise the price for materials that American manufacturers need to make their products and for the equipment required to build new factories, and they undermine the long-term certainty that reassures investors.
Still, the reshoring of clean energy supply chains has continued, and signs touting FEOC

Origami developed a steel frame technology to replace the usual aluminum frames that wrap around solar panels. This enhances structural integrity as solar modules grow ever larger and more powerful. Indiana manufacturer Bila Solar, for instance, recently 550
But beyond preventing bending or buckling, the acquisition is a domestic-production play. The U.S. aluminium industry has 2025open steel plants around the country to produce the torque tubes that carry the panels through their daily rotation.

Sales of these U.S.-made cells very much depend on the domestic content adder to compete with cheaper imports: “
That’s a clear risk factor, because that perk will disappear along with the solar tax credits. But tax rules say that if developers start construction before next July 4
It’s hard to know what context manufacturers will be operating in at that point. But Zhu noted that “
Longer-term certainty would be nice for the generational effort to reshore the solar supply chain, but maybe five busy years of manufacturing is enough to look forward to right now.

The Environmental Protection Agency revoked an essential Clean Air Act permit last month from Atlantic Shores, an offshore wind development slated to be built off the New Jersey coast. One of the main justifications was President Donald Trump’s January executive order calling for a halt and reexamination of the fledgling offshore wind industry.
The move suggests the agency, which has historically played a relatively small role in wind development, may be joining Trump’s assault on a renewable sector that many blue states are counting on to slash their planet-warming emissions and

Depending on the location and size of the project, an offshore wind farm needs to secure between eight and 10
If you don’t already have them, you’re effectively locked out of building a wind farm over the next several years given Trump’s directive to freeze new permitting. Only nine projects in the U.S. — including Atlantic Shores — had all the necessary permits in hand when Trump took office again in January. But as indicated by the case of Atlantic Shores, even having all the paperwork in order may not be enough to keep projects from being crippled by the Trump administration’s assault on wind.

The Illinois Pollution Control Board is considering adopting not only California’s clean truck standards but also the Golden State’s 2035
Illinois advocates have focused mostly on the clean trucks program because of the health and environmental justice implications of diesel-powered trucks throughout the state. They are especially concerned about places like Joliet and Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood, a largely immigrant community where warehouses have also proliferated.

My home in New Hampshire has been 43 days and counting off grid thanks to solar and batteries. We powered our cars, pool, heat pumps, and everything else during the heat wave with solar and stored solar energy. When my utility put out the request to curtail usage to reduce demand I was ahead of the curve, and still exporting power for my neighbors to use. I just wish I could have been credited at the retail price at that time (over $1,000/MW) We would have had dollars instead of cents credited in just one day!

Renewable energy just notched a major milestone.
Worldwide, renewables produced more electricity than coal across the first half of this year — a first, according to
The global revolution in solar deployment made the milestone possible. The energy source more than doubled its share of global electricity generation over the last four years alone, rising from 382021882025
Taken together, the two clean-energy sources increased fast enough to not only meet all new electricity demand in the first six months of 2025
Despite the progress, coal remains the single largest source of electricity in the world. No renewable-energy source on its own — be it wind, solar, hydro, or bioenergy — measures up to coal. And although renewable energy on the whole has now surpassed coal, it’s not like coal generation is plummeting. Power plants still plowed through more coal in the first half of this year than they did in the first half of 2021
But coal power is stagnant. Meanwhile, renewables, and solar in particular, are ascendant. This latest milestone is worth celebrating not because fossil fuel use has been dealt a fatal blow, but because it’s a clear illustration of the trajectory each energy source is on.
For the world to truly reorient itself around energy sources that don’t bake the planet and spew toxic fumes into the air, those trends must not only continue but accelerate. Coal — and eventually gas — will need to decline as assuredly as renewables soar. Let’s call this a step in that direction.

So I feel like the IEA released a report a couple of months ago that said that renewables would surpass coal in global energy production by 2026. So were they using a different metric, or does this in fact mean that not only was that goal surpassed a year earlier than they predicted, it had in fact already been surpassed by the time they were writing that prediction??? Either way, awesome news!

Canary Media’s chart of the week translates crucial data about the clean energy transition into a visual format.
Clean energy projects in the U.S. have gone through a growth spurt in recent years, with the average installation of solar panels, wind turbines, or batteries now way bigger than it used to be.
New data from 25
The definition of a big clean energy project has shifted quite a bit in recent years.
According to an 20242014200520241520242019
Just to drive it home further: The largest solar project that went online in 2014151690 Gemini Project in Nevada, which was paired with a 380 grid battery — last year’s biggest storage installation.
Most of these huge projects are located in Texas, the designated state for building really big things. The Lone Star State leads the nation in terms of installed utility-scale solar and wind capacity and is gaining on California for the grid-battery crown.
Solar was the runaway favorite among developers of major installations. Out of the 2518
Clean energy projects are growing in size for a simple reason: economies of scale. It’s far cheaper on a per-watt basis to install a whole lot of panels, turbines, and battery cells all at once than it is to split them up into smaller projects. Thomas points to other drivers of the trend, too, like the fact that it’s simpler to permit and interconnect one big project than multiple smaller ones.
The average project size for planned solar, wind, and battery projects is set to climb even higher in the coming years, Thomas found. Solar projects planned to come online in 2025125MW202465MW
That trend is evident in glancing at recent headlines, too: Oregon regulators in December approved a humongous project that will have 1200MW1200MWnumber of offshore wind projects with permits in hand will have over 2000MW350MW
Of course, this trend now has the Trump administration to contend with. President Donald Trump has been hostile toward the clean energy industry, but while it seems certain that wind projects will slow over the next four years, it’s still unclear whether the solar and battery boom will face such strong headwinds.

A growing chorus of New England state officials — and not just Republicans — is calling for cuts to clean energy programs in an attempt to rein in high electric bills.
These efforts are underway everywhere from Maine, where legislators are trying to repeal incentives for rooftop and community solar, to deep-blue Massachusetts, where regulators recently slashed $500
The irony, clean energy advocates say, is that many of the investments under threat contribute relatively little to customers’ monthly bills and save everyone money in the long run.
““
Concerns about the cost of energy are not unique to New England, but the region does have the nation’s highest electricity prices outside of California and Hawaii. Compounding the problem, this year’s cold winter increased gas and electric use, driving recent bills to levels many ratepayers and policymakers say are unsustainable.
Politicians have responded by pointing a finger at renewable energy and energy efficiency efforts. In Connecticut, Republicans are pushing to weaken the state’s Global Warming Solutions Act, saying the move is necessary to lower prices for residents. In Rhode Island, a Democratic lawmaker has proposed 10
Though each state’s circumstances are different, advocates argue that it is almost universally true that these intended quick fixes would cost consumers and the environment in the long-run. Solutions exist, they say, that would preserve the long-term benefits clean energy and energy efficiency offer, while also making power less expensive.
“
## What makes power so expensive in New England?
Electricity bills are made up of several components. The supply charge pays for the actual power delivered to a customer. Distribution and transmission charges cover the cost of the wires, poles, and other infrastructure needed to deliver that power. Utilities often collect additional fees to fund energy efficiency programs, renewable energy initiatives, assistance for low-income customers, and other work.
While this last segment of the bill has gotten the most attention lately, the other two make up the majority of the monthly cost. In Maine, for example, electricity supply currently accounts for 3951
Lowering — or even stabilizing — supply and delivery costs can be tricky. But it is precisely the renewable energy and energy efficiency programs being targeted for cuts that can help control those costs, because they lessen the need for expensive grid upgrades and shelter ratepayers from volatile natural gas prices, advocates say.
Utility infrastructure is built to handle far more power than is needed on most days; the systems are scaled to be able to meet the demand of millions of air conditioners running on the hottest days of the year. So lowering the power needed at those peak moments — through energy-efficient heat pumps or rooftop solar panels that generate power right where it’s needed — can reduce the cost of keeping the infrastructure up to the challenge.
““
Energy efficiency and renewable energy progress can also mean cheaper power supply. Electricity supply in New England is so expensive in large part because of the region’s dependence on power plants that run on natural gas, a fuel that is prone to price volatility and which is forecast to get more expensive in coming years. Energy efficiency improvements lower electricity demand, reducing the impact these price fluctuations have on consumers. And replacing this power with renewable energy that gets free fuel from the sun and wind can also reduce and stabilize electric bills.
Cutting support for renewables and efficiency may seem to save money, but the costs just crop up again elsewhere, said Greg Cunningham, vice president of clean energy and climate change for the Conservation Law Foundation.
“
## How to lower energy bills in the Northeast
Containing costs for supply, distribution, and transmission is challenging but doable and necessary, advocates say.
Though Massachusetts’ cuts to energy efficiency programming disappointed consumer and environmental groups, many praised a plan Gov. Maura Healey announced this month to save residents $58
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu this week announced plans to tackle the city’s high energy costs by installing 500010000150300
Connecticut legislators are considering proposals to make appliance energy standards more stringent and to allow cities and towns to aggregate their energy demand, negotiate for lower supply prices, and potentially use the savings to develop their own renewable power projects.
Advocates have also suggested that states adopt a performance-based ratemaking structure, in which utilities make money not just for building and repairing infrastructure but for reaching specific goals, such as equity, emissions reductions, or cost control. Several noted that states could also lower the rate of return utilities are allowed to earn on their infrastructure investments.
Clean energy advocates accept that some programs might need to change. Massachusetts, for example, could reconsider the value of some years-old initiatives paid for by ratepayers, Chretien said. In Maine, it makes more sense to review the solar-incentive program known as net energy billing for possible cost-saving tweaks than to completely repeal it, Cunningham said.
What’s important, advocates say, is that policymakers avoid scapegoating energy efficiency and renewable energy, and start the hard work of solving the real problems.

Cutting the most inexpensive and efficient source of power known to mankind with the expectation of bringing down costs? How psychotic is that? If only we had not closed all those state hospitals years ago.... psychosis is a rampant epidemic in our species now, entrenched in our highest level of government. The terribly fragile state of the mental health of the human species has put us squarely on the fast track to extinction.

Tenova’s technology can swap out natural gas for hydrogen without any modifications. While Midrex says its equipment needs only minor upgrades to optimize for hydrogen, Tenova said the innate flexibility of its system allows it to ride out whichever way the political tides turn in the U.S.

Weeks after Cleveland-Cliffs started backing away from the project, Nippon Steel secured Trump’s approval to take over American rival U.S. Steel. The Japanese behemoth, the world’s fourth-largest steel producer, lags so far behind other companies in developing a decarbonization plan that the watchdog group SteelWatch recently described Nippon as “

Sorry, but it is not, nor will it ever be, ""great to see this administration"" do anything at all, no matter if it miraculously results in a good outcome or not. This is an illegal, criminally corrupt, and evil government bent on the complete destruction of all, and any, things decent or good. The only thing that could ever possibly ""great to see"" with this so-called ""adminstration"" would be lengthy or lifetime prison sentences for all who participate in it, and remedial rehabilitation sentences (re-education, mental repair and reconstruction, that sort of thing) for all who support it.

We built and operate a solar microgrid at our non-grid-connected farm in California, and the reliability is far greater than for some of our neighbors who rely on utility connection (and PG&E would no doubt not be interested in bringing the mile of line over mountainous terrain to the location). Two other neighbors have done similar, and all three of us have EV chargers and other substantial infrastructure running on our stand-alone microgrids.

Great article, Jeff.
The cost of providing service to these remote customers is the ultimate cost-shifting that is never discussed by the utility companies. Using distributed resources to service them is the right approach - as it should be in many other situations, including community solar and building and house micro-grids.

The shorter transmission lines within the microgrid are equally capable of shorting out and starting fires during windstorms as the traditional long distance transmission lines, no?
Are microgrid operations able to and willing to reduce supplying power to larger users including artificial intelligence computer facilities during times of greater total demands?

@Allan Jayne asks ""[are microgrids] capable of shorting out and starting fires during windstorms as the traditional long distance transmission lines...?"" I""m not the industry expert, but the answer is ""no"". Transmission lines run at high voltages (between 230 kV and 500 kV) -- those high voltages can create big sparks when anything (e.g. tree branches) come in contact. By contrast, the voltage from a local PV array is a thousand times lower and runs inside insulated wires and thus are unlikely to cause sparks that start fires.

Australia has put itself on a realistic path to achieving what climate activists around the world have long dreamed of: running its power grid entirely on renewable energy.

Australia’s efforts could offer a proof of concept for how a nation with a bustling, modern economy can rapidly shift its electricity from fossil fuels — mostly coal with some gas — to wind, solar, storage, and other renewable sources like hydropower.

So far, 3546
Because this transition is primarily driven by market forces, rather than a legislative or regulatory requirement, Westerman couldn’t say for sure when Australia will hit the 100902035
The more pressing milestone, though, will be the country’s first day with no coal generation on the system, which could happen far sooner due to some combination of competitive forces and mechanical trouble at the aging plants. It’s a landmark Westerman has experienced before: He operated the U.K. electricity network in 2017shut down seven years later, in 2024

## Unleashing renewables, large and small
Australia’s renewables outlook is strong for a few key reasons.
For one, it enjoys distinct geographical advantages, Jenkins noted: It spans a sunny, windy landmass the size of the contiguous United States, but with just 2713
It also has policy advantages. Australia has a national market governing the power sector, which allows technologies to proliferate faster than in places with patchwork regulations (like the U.S.) or strong incumbent monopoly utilities (also like the U.S.). Furthermore, Australia has avoided U.S.-style clean-energy trade protectionism, so cheap Chinese imports are plentiful.
Last month, the National Electricity Market topped out at more than 77
Australia doesn’t just excel at big renewables and big batteries. Four million homes produce rooftop solar; a few weeks ago, those households temporarily supplied 55

If the coal plants are headed for extinction, something else needs to take on these responsibilities. Batteries can replicate some services. But Westerman worries about a service called
One way to do this is by building devices called synchronous condensers, which include a rotating hunk of metal that can spin without fossil-fuel combustion. But constructing new single-purpose infrastructure is expensive, especially when the energy-only markets don’t currently reward this grid service on its own.

Hydrostor will shore up local power by excavating an underground cavity and compressing air into it; releasing the compressed air turns a turbine to regenerate up to 200
But unlike batteries, Hydrostor’s technology uses old-school generators, and its compressors contribute additional spinning metal.

Transmission grid operator Transgrid ran a competitive process to determine the best way to provide system security to Broken Hill in the event it had to operate apart from the grid, Norman said. That analysis chose Hydrostor’s bid to simply insert a clutch when it installs its machinery.
The project still needs to get built, but if up-and-coming clean storage technologies could step in to provide that grid security, it wouldn’t all have to come from ghostly gas plants lingering on the system.

The Trump administration’s order to stop construction of the nearly completed Revolution Wind project is putting hundreds of offshore workers out of a job — including dozens of local fishermen who voted for President Donald Trump and are asking him to reverse course.
A week ago, the acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Matthew Giacona, ordered the Danish wind developer Ørsted to stop all offshore work on the Revolution Wind farm so the federal government can​“address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States.” Giacona did not specify the nature of those security concerns.

Though often seen as opposed to offshore wind, many New England fishermen have made peace with the industry in recent years.
They increasingly rely on part-time salaries from wind companies as fishing revenues dry up. Over the past two years, Ørsted put 8095

The stop-work order echoes a similar one the Interior Department gave in April that froze all offshore work on New York’s Empire Wind project — a move that grounded Sea Services’ fishermen for a month, until Trump lifted the ban.
Yerman and other commercial fishermen remained quiet the last time Trump’s assault on a wind farm put them out of work. This time they’re speaking out.

Ørsted was one of the first firms building turbines in U.S. waters to employ local fishermen, offering Sea Services a contract in 2021South Fork Wind — America’s first large-scale offshore wind farm, which went online last year.

The extra income from Revolution Wind has been a lifeline, particularly for scallop fishermen who, in recent years, have been severely restricted in how much they can fish.
Strict federal quotas have been put in place to allow scallop populations to rebuild after years of being overfished, according to Morris, but that has meant scallopers — who form the majority of Sea Services’ members — are off the water for about 10
Before the pause on Revolution Wind, scalloper Kevin Souza expected to make an additional $200000“10000030000“
Souza has recruited both of his sons, his nephew, and other young people from longtime fishing families to work for the wind industry. They might have otherwise left the scallop industry if not for the supplemental income, he said.

That kind of faith makes Trump’s pause on Revolution Wind even more gutting.

Trump’s attacks on wind have dried up job prospects for local fishermen up and down the East Coast. His administration’s hostile actions have thrown sand in the gears of a New Jersey wind farm that planned to start construction in the next three years,
In addition to targeting individual projects, the Trump administration has initiated policies intended to killing offshore wind leasing, pausing permitting for wind farms, and sunsetting tax credits critical to their economic viability.
Many fishermen, including those who have pocketed thousands by working at offshore wind farms, remain wary of the companies building turbines out at sea.
““
Trump’s pause on Revolution Wind imposes yet another hardship.
Alvernaz voted for Trump and opposes certain wind farms that he believes pose a risk to his favorite fishing grounds. He said that he does not support Revolution Wind due to its placement on Cox Ledge, a swath of seabed identified by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as critical habitat for Atlantic cod.

“We’ve lived with the water getting warmer, watched the fish move north, and had to adapt again and again.” Yet they support Trump still, blindly. His killing green energy and wind goes further than this income stream working for the constructor of the wind project now brought to a halt. Trump and his henchman are pushing more fossil fuel production and consumption-raising the water temp and levels more and more each year. I guess they don't see the obvious. Commercial fisherman have almost always been self destructive without regulation. The exception is new england lobsterman voluntarily returning egg bearing and larger breeder ones and ones they notch the tail on when it's an egg laying female. Most fishing would catch every living organism of that species until it was no longer viable. Regulation is needed and in long run is better for them. But they and the farmers who support Trump are blind to what they voted for and don't like the effects its starting to have on them. Wise up. It may already be too late.

The Trump administration has launched an all-out assault on American energy-efficiency efforts that have saved consumers billions of dollars and eased the transition away from fossil fuels.
From proposing to eliminate the popular Energy Star and Low Income Home Energy Assistance programs to firing staff and delaying building efficiency standards, President Donald Trump’s moves threaten to upend decades of progress on making appliances and structures do more with less energy.

And with electricity demand forecast to climb to record highs due in large part to the rapid expansion of AI, efficiency could take on new importance as a way to get more out of every unit of energy.

It would be nice if Senator Collins was correct that Congress holds the power of the purse. It appears that Congress perhaps controls how much goes INTO the purse, but not how much comes OUT of the purse.
I've not previously imagined that a national leader would engage in economic suicide. But that is clearly happening, from tariffs to Energy Star, from reducing incentives for EVs to penalizing US automakers for doing what the Trump-negotiated North American Trade Agreement incentived them to do.
First, we kill all the lawyers. Then we turn the gun and shoot ourself in the kneecaps.

After a decade of urging from clean energy advocates, utility Duke Energy finally has a plan to let its North Carolina customers access detailed information about their electricity use.
Approved by state regulators on July 16
The Duke plan is a step toward solving a common problem for utility customers, large and small: They don’t have ready access to complete, granular information about their energy use or an easy way to share that data with others. That can complicate decarbonization efforts for a range of consumers, from households that want rooftop solar to cities aiming to shrink their carbon footprints.
The city of Charlotte, for instance, owns one of the world’s busiest airports, which it aims to power entirely with clean energy by the end of the decade. But dozens of private entities within the facility have electricity accounts, so city officials don’t know exactly how much power the entire complex uses — or how much renewable energy they need to meet their target.
At the other end of the size spectrum, individuals considering energy-efficiency improvements, rooftop solar panels, or switching to a heat pump often don’t have a full picture of when their energy use peaks or which appliances gobble up the most power.
Limited access to energy-usage data is hardly confined to Duke, said Michael Murray, who cofounded the nonprofit Mission:data after realizing that
“201310“41“
Like North Carolina-based advocates, Mission:data has been cajoling Duke for better data access for years. And though the group declined to endorse the proposal put forward in November by the utility, in-state advocates, and others, Murray doesn’t question the rationale of those who backed it.
“
That’s especially welcome under the Trump administration, which has created countless new barriers to adopting clean energy. With the November proposal now blessed by regulators, communities and individuals alike are better equipped to take advantage of what federal climate programs still exist — and to decarbonize in general.
“
For example, North Carolina’s federally funded $156

Virtual power plants are networks of rooftop solar, home batteries, and other distributed energy resources that utilities can manipulate to support grid reliability at large, while time-of-use rates are electricity charges that vary over the course of the day to nudge energy use to periods of low demand.
“
But certain features of the new data access program remain unsettled, and the devil could be in those details, says Murray.
Customers can receive two years of their own individual data for free. But Murray worries that regulators will allow Duke to charge exorbitant access fees for aggregated data or to third parties, which would undercut the program.

The spark gap, the ratio of average electricity price to fossil-gas price (each in dollars per kilowatt-hour), varies from state to state. A ratio of less than about three to four typically makes switching to a heat pump more economically feasible without additional policy support because industrial heat pumps are about three to four times as efficient as gas boilers and thus can lower operating costs, Chen noted.
Electric utilities and regulators could redesign rates to make the electric equipment more attractive. The idea has precedent for home heat pumps, though hasn’t been realized for industrial ones yet, as far as Chen’s aware.
State and federal programs are also helping to defray the capital costs of electrifying.
California provides $100168500projects cleaning up emissions from process heat, part of a $6 for industrial-decarbonization demonstration projects.

Thanks. Interesting article - does ACEE know exactly what the boilers in each county are used for (particularly the amount of heat needed) and ownership/location? I assume the data is not that granular. And 3 years is a pretty standard time period for measuring the returns on capital expenditures. While 5-7 might work better, anything beyond 10 really isn't feasible. It would be interesting to connect this data with the county governments or educational institutions that work in those areas.

Only a handful of vessels in the world are capable of lifting, carrying, and piecing together the massive steel components of offshore turbines.
Thursday’s news highlights the complexity of bringing just one U.S. offshore wind farm over the finish line, given the combination of logistical difficulties and political obstacles put up by the Trump administration.
In an email to Canary Media, a Maersk Offshore Wind spokesperson confirmed that the company terminated its building contract with Seatrium “

In September, the company delivered the $715Charybdis from its Brownsville, Texas, shipyard to the Portsmouth Marine Terminal in Virginia. The American-made vessel is owned by utility Dominion Energy, which immediately put it to work building the largest offshore wind farm in the U.S. The ship’s smooth delivery is a major reason why the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind farm is progressing fast enough to have a new March 2026.

Cleveland Works currently relies on two blast furnaces, which use coal to refine iron ore that is later processed into steel. (The Center For Land Use Interpretation;
Cleveland has big ambitions to reduce its planet-warming emissions. But a massive steelmaking facility run by Cleveland-Cliffs, one of Ohio’s major employers, could make it difficult for the city to see those plans through.
The plant emits roughly 422050
Cleveland’s ““
As a major investment decision looms over an aging blast furnace at the facility, it’s unclear whether the company will move to cut its direct greenhouse gas emissions — or opt to reinvest in its existing coal-dependent processes.
Cliffs’ progress in reducing its nationwide emissions earned it recognition as a 2023 in the Department of Energy’s Better Climate Challenge. As this year began, the company was set to slash emissions even further through projects supported by Biden-era legislation — the Inflation Reduction Act and the 2021
Then the Trump administration commenced its monthslong campaign of reneging on funding commitments for clean energy projects, including ones meant to ramp up the production of “CEOMiddletown Works in southwestern Ohio to produce green steel, saying there wouldn’t be a sufficient supply of hydrogen for the plant.
To Lewis, coauthor of the Industrious Labs report, that’s a weak excuse, because hydrogen production by other companies would have ramped up to supply the facility. “[Cliffs was] going to need so much hydrogen that they would be creating the demand,” she said.
Meanwhile, Cliffs’ Cleveland Works continues to spew emissions that drive climate change and harm human health. Industrious Labs’ modeling estimates that pollution from Cleveland Works is responsible for up to 3917009000
## A road map for cutting carbon
Cleveland Works’ Blast Furnace #6
To Industrious Labs, this presents an opportunity: The company could replace the old infrastructure with equipment that can process iron ore with natural gas or hydrogen instead of coal. Investing in this technology, called direct reduction, would cut the plant’s greenhouse gas emissions by more than 30
The alternative is to just reline the furnace, which was the course Cliffs chose for the Cleveland facility’s Blast Furnace #52022
Relining might provide small emissions cuts when measured per ton of steel, due to increased efficiencies, Lewis said. But ramped-up production from running more ore through the furnace could offset those reductions or even increase total emissions.
Cliffs did not respond to Canary Media’s repeated requests for comment for this story, and it has not yet publicly announced its plans for Blast Furnace #6
To put itself on track with Cleveland’s emissions goals, however, the company would need to do more than just convert Blast Furnace #6
The next step in the road map the group laid out would be for Cliffs to process refined iron ore into steel with an electric arc furnace — which can run on carbon-free power — instead of using the current basic oxygen equipment. Investing in green-hydrogen-based direct reduction and an electric arc furnace, instead of relining Blast Furnace #647
Later steps would use direct reduction of iron and an electric arc furnace to refine and process the ore that is currently handled by Blast Furnace #596
## What happens now?
The Industrious Labs analysis appears to lay out a credible decarbonization pathway, although not necessarily the only one, said Jenita McGowan, Cuyahoga County’s deputy chief of sustainability and climate. Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, also has a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050
“
For now, the city and county seem to be taking a pragmatic approach, focusing on achievements to date and encouraging future cuts wherever companies will make them.
But getting to net-zero for the industrial sector “40“
Cuyahoga County’s draft climate plan highlights Cliffs’ energy-efficiency improvements, including Cleveland Works’ use of some iron from the firm’s direct reduction plant in Toledo, Ohio. Cleveland Works also leverages much of the waste heat from its industrial activities to make electricity. The facility recently boosted that combined-heat-and-power generation by about 50
Faster emissions reductions are certainly better, McGowan said. But the county also wants to make sure companies can stay in business as they decarbonize — especially Cliffs, one of the largest sources of commerce at the city’s port.
In Lewis’ view, decarbonizing Cleveland Works earlier rather than later would be a smart business move for Cliffs. “
One of Cliffs’ largest markets is supplying high-quality steel for automobiles, including electric vehicles, she added. In March, Hyundai announced plans to invest $6produce low-carbon steel. As automakers face global pressure to source cleaner metal, Cliffs could find itself left behind, Lewis suggested.

This summer,
Efforts like these are playing out worldwide as the maritime industry works to replace dirty diesel fuel in oceangoing ships, which haul everything from T-shirts and tropical fruit to solar panels, smartphones, and steel rebar. But the progress to date has been piecemeal, representing only a sliver of the world’s oil-guzzling freighters and tankers.
Up until last week, the United Nations’ International Maritime Organization appeared on the cusp of approving a strategy to supercharge shipping decarbonization worldwide. The plan was set in motion in 2015

In the meantime, the industry will continue guzzling greater volumes of fossil fuels as shipping activity grows over time.

Current adoption of those fuels amounts to a tiny droplet in an ocean’s worth of oil. Much of it is driven by voluntary efforts by companies like Maersk, which face pressure from investors and customers to clean up their fleets. Meanwhile, regional environmental policies are taking effect. European nations and China are working to rein in ship-engine pollution, and they and other countries — including Brazil, India, and, until recently, the United States — are steering government funding into hydrogen production.
Hydrogen is a key component of ammonia and methanol — two common chemicals that can be used in engines or fuel cells. How clean those fuels actually are depends largely on whether the hydrogen is produced using renewables, or the way that most H2 is made today: with fossil fuels. Renewable diesel, another lower-carbon option for powering vessels, also uses hydrogen in its production process.
If every project to produce green ammonia, green methanol, and renewable diesel comes online as planned, and if the fuels only go toward powering ships — not airplanes or vehicles or to other uses — they would make up less than 202030290

The paltry amount of battery storage system in PJM shows that the capacity accreditation process is not working as it does elsewhere. The problem is that planners do not realize that it is the fleet of batteries that provides flexibility that can be used to meet peak demand in areas of the system as well as respond to contingencies.

Planners may realize the value more grid scale storage, but at the regulatory body level the lack of tools to incentivize investment in that area may be lacking. Some efforts to change that are underway, but those moves are in the early stages. Now at the national level there is a highly organized and efficient war on all things decent, all things good, all things renewable, so they may not be effective in the end.

While our criminal ""President"" does his level best to kill renewable power generation growth along with all things decent and good, our basic infrastructure crumbles and starves. Some fortunate folks were able to take the right steps in recent years, and now harvest the sun to power their homes and transportation. PJM'S struggles will have very little effect on my own household, but I certainly sympathize with the many who will feel the impacts. The process involved in getting residential systems like mine into operation was revealing. Inefficiencies and communication avoidance in the process at the grid operator level, the local inspection level, etc.... cause a person to wonder if the slow walking and stiff arming is deliberate and by design. I can only imagine what the grid scale scale commissioning landscape is like.

The Trump administration recently terminated a $49 for the Grain Belt Express, the country’s biggest transmission grid project. Sen. Martin Heinrich, Democrat from New Mexico, says the decision is illegal.
In an exclusive new interview with Canary Media, Heinrich discusses why he’s demanding that the Department of Energy account for the decision — and what response he’s received.
Last month, Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, DOE
“DOE“
That trust is eroding rapidly, Heinrich said. The project has been in the works for more than a decade and is one of only a handful of major transmission developments underway in the United States.
The Grain Belt Express would support gigawatts’ worth of new wind and solar projects — energy sources that are under attack by the Trump administration.
The new GOPmegalaw is expected to cut new solar, wind, and battery deployments 96 being added to the U.S. grid.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration has unleashed a
The move to block the Grain Belt Express is part of this broader attempt to slow renewable energy — just when the country can least afford it, Heinrich said.
This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.
Why did you decide to write the letter to Energy Secretary Chris Wright?
Secretary Wright, before he was secretary, said numerous times to our committee [the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources] that he was going to follow the law, and a conditional loan guarantee is a legally binding commitment.
It’s as if you go to your bank and you get preapproved for a mortgage, then when you show up for the closing, you expect the bank to make good on that. And that’s what we had here.
The reality is, we need this administration to follow the law and make good on commitments that have been made so that there is predictability in the market. We also need every cheap electron we can get right now, and so if you put these big infrastructure projects in jeopardy, what you’re really doing is passing along more costs to consumers.
Have you received any response from DOE
Not yet.
Do you expect you’ll eventually get a response?
I certainly expect to. And if the secretary wants to be taken seriously by the Senate, then he needs to provide that information.
One of the things that really bothers me about a lot of the actions that the Department of Energy and the Department of Interior are taking right now is the sum total is creating a lot of uncertainty in the finance markets, and that flows through to create additional costs for consumers.
When you have a big transmission project like this one, there are $52
You asked the department if it had analyzed the impact of canceling the loan guarantee. What do you see as the administration’s responsibility in analyzing its actions on energy policy in terms of affordability? And are they fulfilling those responsibilities?
They are not. And it doesn’t take a detailed analysis to understand that, in an environment of surging demand, if you artificially constrain supply, you’re going to be raising costs for people. And I want the American people to know that this is not an accident. They are choosing to take actions which are raising people’s electric bills.
Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican representing Iowa, has said he until there’s some response from the administration regarding its actions on wind and solar tax credits. Can you tell us more about where members of Congress have power to challenge how the administration is managing energy policy?
Well, I think the confirmation process is one obvious place. This is an administration that has been very public about saying that they need more people in place to be able to execute their agenda. But unless they’re responsive to the Congress, that process is not going to speed up.
You asked the DOEclosed loans and conditional commitments that the department is reviewing. Have you received any response?
I’ll be honest, they have not been particularly transparent or responsive on many of these issues, and that is a trend that I think does not bode well for the next several years.

Under the Biden administration, the federal government gave out billions of dollars to companies looking to slash the planet-heating emissions from concrete, cement, and asphalt.

State legislatures saw a torrent of anti-clean energy bills introduced this year — and little more than a trickle of measures that would benefit renewables. Fortunately, most of the legislation was not signed into law.
As of June, with most states’ legislative sessions wrapped up for the year, 305471486889
The vast majority of these bills stalled out, and of the few that were signed into law, slightly more were favorable to clean energy than hostile to it. Ten pro-renewables siting laws passed versus seven that are expected to restrict clean energy.
Still, the flood of new anti-renewables legislation underscores the increasingly hostile policy environment for clean energy.
Already, 1645944
Such policies are becoming more common around the U.S., the Sabin Center finds, a fact that is not surprising given shrinking public approval for large clean energy projects. Support for expanding solar farms fell from 66522022
Still, some Democrat-led states are boosting policy support for clean energy deployment — most notably Colorado. Even in deep-red Ohio, the governor signed into law a bipartisan, tech-neutral bill that is expected to make it modestly easier to build clean energy.
States and municipalities have significant power to advance clean energy, even without the federal government. They also have the ability to stifle it, making state and local government a crucial arena for the energy transition. Right now, with Trump’s all-out campaign against clean energy at their back, opponents of renewables have the momentum.

The wide-ranging projects included installing industrial heat pumps at up to 10
Distributed under the Industrial Demonstrations Program at the Energy Department’s now-embattled Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, the funding promised to bolster the manufacturing sector with a major investment in technologies meant to give American companies an edge in global markets.
Groups such as C2ESgenerate hundreds of thousands of jobs in both direct construction and operations and indirect hiring at real estate firms, restaurants, and retailers near the industrial sites. In addition, federal researchers expected to gather information through the projects that could be used broadly throughout U.S. industry to improve output and bring down energy costs.

With the funding, U.S. industry had the chance to develop new approaches that could produce greener — and cheaper — materials, giving American manufacturers an edge over Asian or European rivals as corporate and national carbon-cutting policies put a premium on products made with less emissions. Absent that, Mulholland said, U.S. companies risk falling behind competitors who benefit from lower-cost labor and easily accessible components from nearby industrial clusters, like those in Vietnam, China, or Germany.
“
Already, a handful of companies are considering shifting production overseas in the wake of the funding cuts, according to two sources who have directly spoken to leaders of firms that lost federal funding. The sources were granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the plans.

In the long term, he added, the cuts erode the value of a federal contract.

Part of the problem is that the contracts were cost-share agreements, which traditionally give the federal government the right to exit the deals without any legal penalty. In theory, OCED“CHIPS“

As a result, the agency stuck to the financing mechanisms with which it was familiar — such as cost-share agreements.

OCOchem’s pilot plant for producing formates via electrolytic cells. (OCOchem)
The global chemicals industry is big, and it’s dirty. Chemical plants consume lots of fossil fuels, both to power the high-temperature, high-pressure processes involved and often as a feedstock for the chemicals produced. And to maximize production, those plants are typically built to be as large as possible.
Todd Brix, CEO

Last week, the company’s pilot plant in Richland, Washington, started producing a class of chemicals known as formates, used in everything from deicing airplanes to preserving animal feed. But instead of the 15
OCOchem fills those modules with water and carbon dioxide and then zaps the solution with electricity, causing an electrochemical reaction that yields formic acid, a combination of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon. Chemically speaking, it’s ““CO2

Factory-built modular devices are being tried out across various industries, from fertilizer to steel — and they are even being considered for nuclear power. It’s already a winning pathway in the renewable energy sector, where mass-produced solar panels and lithium-ion battery cells have seen costs drop steeply as production volumes increase and manufacturers consistently improve each new generation of products.
““
Tiny chemicals-production cells are a bit more complicated than solar panels, of course. But OCOchem’s electrolytic cells aren’t taking on anything as dangerous as nuclear fission. Brix described the process as akin to “
Using electrolysis to produce formate is far from a unique idea, said Brix, who worked at Chevron, Intel, and Microsoft before founding OCOchem in 2020

Those contracts are for the formate it will make, not for the equipment itself, he noted. “
## A cleaner — and cheaper — path to bigger chemicals markets?

The trick is to find cost-effective ways to separate the hydrogen molecules from the formates once they reach their destination, said Ye Xu, associate professor of chemical engineering at Louisiana State University.

Xu’s search for substitute catalysts to make formate a viable hydrogen carrier involves massive computational research as well as collaboration with scientists doing real-world research. In a way, Brix noted, it’s a similar process to the years of research that have gone into OCOchem’s core technologies, such as the gas-diffusion electrodes that allow it to electrolyze water and CO2
Taking such experiments from laboratory to pilot project to commercial production may be labor-intensive and costly. But building, testing, and redesigning the next generation of technologies is a lot easier and faster on an assembly line than as part of a complicated, yearslong engineering, procurement, and construction project to build large-scale facilities, Brix said.

Thanks for this piece. This part of Speaker Hortaman's isn't as well known as it should be partly because she wasn't one to seek the spot light. I remember her going to the Climate Talks in Paris and coming back and talking about how she was going to apply what she learned in Minnesota and then ended up doing just that. Such an impressive person on so many fronts.

California has big heat-pump dreams. Now, it’s got a road map to realize them.
Last week, the California Heat Pump Partnership announced the nation’s first critical tech for decarbonizing buildings and improving public health. The plan draws on recommendations from the public-private partnership’s members, which include government agencies, heat pump manufacturers, retailers, utilities, and other stakeholders.

Heat pump units are outselling gas furnaces nationally, but of the roughly 1HVAC80000035heat pump models. The state is one of nine committed to making heat pumps at least 2030
Looking beyond the 2030232045
Heat pumps face considerable challenges to mass adoption in the state. Many Californians aren’t aware of the appliance’s benefits, according to the report. Heat pumps are typically more expensive up front than gas furnaces and can cost more to run in states like California where electricity prices are high relative to those of gas. Plus, many contractors aren’t prioritizing heat pumps, citing a lack of market confidence, the report notes.
The blueprint lays out a raft of solutions to make heat pumps more desirable and affordable. Building customer demand and contractor support is key to making them “

The blueprint points out that focusing on particular markets could help supercharge heat pump adoption. Residents in the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, must start replacing their broken gas-fueled furnaces and water heaters with zero-emissions electric equipment starting in 2027air quality rules.
Consumers in hotter areas, like inland California, will also save more on cooling costs than other customers when they replace older, less-efficient central ACs with heat pumps, making them potentially prime early adopters.

The sweeping tactics laid out in the report will require substantial funding, potentially in the billions of dollars. But exactly how much will be up for debate, Weeks said. Funds could come from a variety of sources, including cap-and-trade revenues, utility ratepayer programs, and state tax dollars, she said. The report recommends minimizing the use of ratepayer funding; California is looking to cut costs to utility customers as the state’s electricity bills skyrocket.

Glassmaking has dramatically evolved in the thousands of years since ancient artisans crafted their first decorative beads and perfume bottles. But the underlying recipe remains virtually the same: Combine sand, sodium carbonate, and limestone, then blast the ingredients with scorching heat in a kiln or furnace.
Today, the vast majority of that heat is supplied by burning fossil fuels. Whether manufacturers are turning glass into windows, beverage bottles, smartphone screens, or coatings for solar panels, their methods require lots of energy to reach superhigh temperatures and, as a result, can be very carbon-intensive.
Global glassmakers in recent years
The latest of these emerging efforts comes from Bavaria, Germany, where the multinational firm Schott
Schott says its electric tank could slash greenhouse gas emissions from the melting process alone by 8040472027
Jonas Spitra, Schott’s head of sustainability communications, said that replacing fossil fuels with electrified technology — while still meeting strict quality requirements for specialty glass — marks “
Schott, which operates in over 30“

The German pilot project is moving forward just as a few ambitious low-carbon glass initiatives in the United States have fallen into limbo. In May, the Trump administration’s Department of Energy canceled awards worth roughly $177
“DOE“
## Getting hot enough to melt glass
Worldwide, manufacturers made more than 1502022420232
Still, glassmaking remains a significant source of planet-warming gases and local air pollutants like nitrogen oxides. And the challenge of slashing those emissions is essentially the same one vexing other heavy industries: figuring out how to reach hot enough temperatures to make materials without cooking the planet in the process.
Chemical producers are pilot-testing their own electric furnaces to make important compounds like ethylene, which is the building block of many plastic products. Cement startups are developing electricity-driven processes and thermal storage systems to replace traditional kilns. Global steelmakers, meanwhile, are investing in technologies that sidestep the need to use coal, such as hydrogen-based ironmaking facilities and electric arc furnaces.
For glass, the biggest hurdle to decarbonization lies in the melting process, Schott’s Spitra explained.
![]( Schott researchers conduct tests on a lab-scale electric melting tank for pharmaceutical glass in Germany. (Schott)
Glass furnaces require temperatures of between 1200170021923092CO2 comes from burning fossil fuels, though some emissions result from the chemical reactions that happen when heating up sodium carbonate (soda ash) and limestone.
In a conventional furnace, gas is injected into a combustion chamber to melt the ingredients into a glowing orange liquid. In an electric version, electrodes pass currents through a conductor to generate heat. Today, the industry mostly uses electric equipment only for smaller-scale furnaces or to supplement the fossil-fuel-based heat inside larger furnaces — a step known as “
Facilities that make high-volume products like container glass and windows are trickier to fully electrify. Existing electric designs have struggled to operate with the same consistency and flexibility as gas furnaces, and they can’t incorporate as much recycled material into the glass mix. Electric furnaces also tend to wear down and need replacing about twice as fast as their gas-burning counterparts, according to glass industry experts.
In Germany, Schott is aiming to address those problems with its new industrial-scale melting tank, which must also meet the exacting standards for bubble-free, high-quality pharmaceutical glass. The initiative, which Schott began developing in 2021

The company is investing in electrification in part to meet European climate regulations, including a “
## An uncertain path to decarbonization
Beyond the technical issues, a few other barriers stand in the way of electrifying glassmaking at a wider scale.
In some locations, the local grid may be unable to support a major increase in electricity use, requiring companies and utilities to upgrade that infrastructure or build more wind, solar, and other electricity resources. For producers of mass-market packaging like soda bottles, it can be harder to convince beverage companies to pay more for low-carbon glass if it means raising the sticker price of the final product, especially if the competition is cheap plastic containers.
Another challenge for U.S. glassmakers in particular is that switching to electricity very likely means paying higher utility bills, making it harder to justify ditching fossil gas.
Sonya Pump, the global sustainability director for Ohio-based O-I Glass, said that gas pricing is one of the key factors the company weighs when evaluating low-carbon furnace technologies — along with potential technical constraints or risks to its manufacturing capabilities. O-I Glass makes billions of glass containers every year in facilities in nearly 20
For that reason, in the U.S., ““

O-I Glass had planned to rebuild an aging furnace in Zanesville, Ohio, and combine five cutting-edge technologies — including for electric boosting, preheating materials, and recovering waste heat — to see how much they could offset gas consumption when working together. The project was slated to receive up to $573DOE
Other initiatives to electrify glassmaking or test replacing gas with hydrogen are also now “
“
For now, he added, glass manufacturers are largely focusing on other strategies to lessen their environmental impact, including improving the energy efficiency and operating performance of existing facilities and working to increase recycling rates for glass containers — only

The closed-loop, electric roasting process is more energy efficient than traditional fossil-gas roasting — about 2310
And, of course, the whole process is less emissions-intensive than relying on fossil gas to produce coffee. Roasting accounts for up to 1587
But those emissions reductions are the end-of-day bonus to a fundamentally economic proposition, Lopez said.

## Electrifying the coffee industry
Electric coffee roasters have served as niche products for small-scale craft roasters for years now. But companies like Bellwether and others in North America and Europe are scaling them up.
Bellwether’s technology has evolved over the years. Its early coffee roasters were cobbled together with steel plating and wooden two-by-fours, Lopez said during the August tour of the company’s headquarters and manufacturing space in West Berkeley. More improvements have followed since its first commercial models rolled out in 201860000
Bellwether has put particular effort into honing its roaster’s closed-loop heat-recovery system, which retains much of the warmth that gas-fired roasters lose in their exhaust, Lopez said. Capturing heat that would otherwise be wasted also helps control for the variables of temperature and humidity that can make it hard to achieve consistent roasting quality, he said.

Coffee roasting isn’t the only industry that could deploy smaller-scale, lower-carbon technologies to decentralize production. Companies are developing factory-built, electricity-powered modular systems to purify iron for steelmaking, synthesize industrial chemicals, and produce ammonia fertilizer.

Electrowinning is a time-tested method for removing impurities from metals, and it’s able to run on clean electricity and at the same temperature as a fresh cup of coffee. Could it help clean up heavy industry by replacing the gigantic coal-fired blast furnaces used to purify iron, a key ingredient in steelmaking?
Sandeep Nijhawan, CEOelectrolytic clean-iron technology startup 186trillion-dollar global iron and steel industry, to further test its proposition.
Thursday’s round was led by Capricorn Investment Group and Temasek Holdings, and included previous investors Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, and S2GBHP

Cutting that carbon footprint requires shifting to electric arc furnaces that use electricity to melt a mix of steel scrap and purified iron into new steel. But to clean up the industry, the purified iron going into those furnaces must first be produced in ways that don’t choke the atmosphere.
““
Electra’s process is competing against a number of alternative methods for making lower-carbon iron. The most prevalent approach to date — and the one that’s gotten billions of dollars of investment — is direct reduction of iron via hydrogen.
Direct reduced iron is being deployed by the biggest green-steel projects in the world, such as the H2 and Hybrit plants in Sweden. But early-stage efforts to build up capacity for hydrogen direct reduced iron in the U.S. have faltered in the face of high costs, lack of commitments from buyers, and more recently, the Trump administration’s U-turn on Biden-era policies supporting industrial decarbonization. The process also requires cost-effective production of carbon-free hydrogen, a challenging prospect in and of itself.

Electra’s approach,
Electra’s quest to purify iron via electrowinning has faced some key challenges. For example, the company had to figure out how to accelerate the dissolution of iron ore in the solution and how to maintain the purity of the ions collected through the electrowinning process, Quoc Pham, the company’s cofounder and chief technology officer, told Canary Media in 2023
Electra has produced plates of pure iron in pilot tests. That’s just the first of many steps in proving it can cost-effectively scale up the technology to operate in high-throughput industrial settings using iron ores with a wide mix of chemical compositions, Nijhawan said.
But success on those fronts could unlock a lot of opportunities for Electra investors along the iron and steel value chain, he said — starting with the company’s longest-running strategic investor and top U.S. steelmaker Nucor.
Nucor exclusively uses electric arc furnaces, which require careful calibration of the mix of scrap steel and purified iron going into them to produce different grades of steel for diverse industrial sectors.
Those include the automotive manufacturing market, where multi-billion-dollar investments in the electric equipment.
““
Electra’s technology can also purify a wide range of iron ores, which could open up new markets for iron-mining giants like those investing in the startup’s latest round, Nijhawan noted. That’s particularly valuable for low-carbon steelmaking since hydrogen direct reduced iron can handle only a narrow range of impurities, which could limit its use to the
Nijhawan highlighted another distinguishing feature of Electra’s approach — its modularity. A typical steel plant that uses a blast furnace or the direct reduced iron process costs billions of dollars, takes years to build, and involves coordinating the delivery of massive amounts of iron and fuel.
Electra’s electrolytic modules, by contrast, can be deployed at a variety of scales to match supply and demand dynamics in different markets. “50000“2
That optionality could ease concerns from investors wary of sinking billions of dollars into a single facility using a novel technology, he said. It also allows Electra to test its modules and improve performance and cost in succeeding generations.
Similar dynamics have helped propel solar panels and lithium-ion batteries to the cheapest and most easily deployable energy technology today, he noted. “

A decade ago, the Sierra Club and other environmental groups, trade organizations, and companies found themselves in a regulatory standoff with American Electric Power over operating costs for six coal-fired power plants in Ohio.
The utility’s opponents objected to letting the company collect more money from customers to keep the unprofitable plants running, while the utility argued the charges were a hedge against even higher costs.
Before state regulators made a decision, the utility and some of its opponents announced a compromise. As part of the deal, the Sierra Club would drop its opposition in exchange for AEP
A Sierra Club representative at the time described it as “nowhere near a perfect deal” but as one that would significantly reduce carbon emissions and accelerate the state’s clean energy transition.
Such compromises will now be prohibited in Ohio under a new state law that forbids settlements involving the closure of “

## Utility settlements have been a part of regulatory process
Negotiating special deals in settlements has long been common in utility regulatory cases. Industry groups or companies have gotten discounts and other benefits in return for dropping opposition to utilities’ added charges. Parties in court cases often settle before trial, too.
For example, the same year that the Sierra Club reached a settlement with AEPnegotiated a special rate with FirstEnergy’s Ohio utilities in exchange for dropping opposition to a customer-funded bailout of that company’s unprofitable coal and nuclear plants. (The secret terms of that agreement were part of a criminal case filed last year against Ohio’s former chief utility regulator, Sam Randazzo. They also became part of a House Bill 6 on which regulators will finally hear evidence this month.)

Neil Waggoner, who heads the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign for the Midwest region, suspects the provision is likely a backlash to the environmental group’s 2015AEP

While better known for its pioneering electric-car business, and the polarizing antics of CEO
Tesla’s white boxy Megapack product, which stitches together lithium-ion batteries inside a large container, has been a top competitor for years. Around the U.S., Megapacks play a crucial role in keeping the lights on: In Oahu, they enabled the safe retirement of Hawaii’s last coal plant; in Oxnard, California, they allowed the city to avoid building a gas plant on its coastline; across Texas, they’re helping lower electricity prices and avoid shortfalls during record heat waves, as are batteries from companies like Fluence and Wärtsilä.
But the storage industry is still young, with plenty of room to streamline operations and bring down costs. That’s what Tesla hopes to do with the new Megablock, which packages four Megapacks around one transformer.

A giant battery installation requires thousands of perfectly executed electrical connections, and mishaps can cause major problems.

If you look at enough photos of grid battery projects, they blur into beige anonymity. But seeing the Megablock up close, the coat of white paint held more allure than it does from afar, more of a pearlescent sheen. A Tesla tour guide told me the shade was selected to maximize reflection of heat from the sun, thus reducing the energy needed to keep the batteries cool. The central chamber of the Megapack features a supercharged version of a Model Y heat pump, borrowed from colleagues on the automotive side of the company to chill liquid cooling streams that keep Megapack batteries and inverters safe.

It’s hard to see how those investors could keep their commitments if that support went away — and harder still to see how any new factories will be planned now, while the fate of that incentive is up in the air.

Even as the federal government attempts to prop up the waning coal industry, New England’s last coal-fired power plant has ceased operations three years ahead of its planned retirement date. The closure of the New Hampshire facility paves the way for its owner to press ahead with an initiative to transform the site into a clean energy complex including solar panels and battery storage systems.

The announcement was the latest offensive in the administration’s pro-coal agenda. The federal government has twice extended the scheduled closure date of the coal-burning J.H. Campbell plant in Michigan, and U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has declared it a mission of the administration to keep coal plants open, saying the facilities are needed to ensure grid reliability and lower prices.
However, the closure in New Hampshire — so far undisputed by the federal government — demonstrates that prolonging operations at some facilities just doesn’t make economic sense for their owners.

Energy affordability has become a flash point over the past few months. It’s a key issue promised to fix by boosting fossil-fuel production. And of course, it’s showing up in the bills that arrive in mailboxes every month.
Three-quarters of Americans count electricity costs as a source of stress in their lives, according to a new 312019202417
One reason why some states saw prices jump? Utility spending on disaster recovery and preparedness. Take California, where utilities have added billions of dollars in wildfire-recovery costs and mitigation programs to retail electricity prices in recent years, the national lab found. It’s a bracing fact as the planet warms and disasters
But the report also tempered fears that the growth of data centers and other power-hungry industries will jack up electricity prices. Grid maintenance has been a top driver of increased electricity costs over the last few years, but spreading these expenses among more customers — like data centers and manufacturers — has helped lower retail electricity prices, researchers found. One caveat: That dynamic tends to benefit large, commercial consumers more than residential ones.
The Trump administration has elevated fossil fuels as a solution to rising electricity bills, positing that more coal and gas power can cut prices. But building a new gas-fired plant is
If you look at two rare examples of power utilities reducing their rates, it’s clear that falling back on coal isn’t the answer either. In Oregon, Idaho Power Co. has 1

Notably missing from the final bill is an excise tax on wind and solar development that cropped up in the Senate version late last week, to the GOP“foreign entities of concern,” and would’ve had a devastating effect on clean power development and the economy as a whole.

In 2022 California's legislators were very worried about grid reliability coming out of the pandemic. While the CPUC in 2021 had ordered the state's utilities and other load serving entities to procure over 15 gigawatts of new reliability resources such as large-scale batteries, the Governor and key legislators were concerned that there would not be enough new batteries to go around because of supply chain disruptions. The DSGS program was part of a larger legislative package called the Strategic Reliability Reserve. The biggest element of that package was to pay the owners of 50+ year old coastal power plants in Southern California $1.2 billion from 2024 through 2026 to keep the plants on stand-by. However, because California successfully added one 10 GW of new batteries since 2022 there has been no need to use these slow-starting thermal power plants in the summers of 2024 and 2025. The DSGS program could be funded in 2026 with the remaining funds from the Strategic Reliability Reserve if the Governor and the Department of Water Resources would terminate the contracts for the unneeded capacity from the old power plants.

2026 will be the spring-board year for V2G, V2H and V2-BESS in California. Now that a V2G charger manufacturing standard has been adopted by NEMA, several manufacturers will be selling systems in CA, including Enphase, dcbl & Wallbox. Some of these chargers connect via meter collar & will cost way less installed than a Tesla Powerwall. When this rolls out, all the EV manufacturers will rapidly enable V2G in any vehicles that are already hardware equipped.
This will also likely lead to an increase in (sub)urban solar parking lot canopy micro grid development at large apartments & condos, shopping centers, business parks & various municipal facilities with large parking lots. Cities, towns & CCAs that want to accelerate energy transition will expedite permitting for these projects to improve public safety, grid reliability, and stabilize energy costs for local business owners and ordinary utility rate payers. Exploiters like BigOil&Gas, utility monopolies, wealthy AI developers, and CryptoPunks who got kicked out of China in 2022 will never do this.

I'm unclear here, why is State funding needed to subsidize these rebates to Sunrun etc. At $200/mw (20 cents per kWh), it seems like the utilities should have sufficient market incentives to purchase from this battery consortium regardless....what am I missing (besides likely role of the CPUC breaking things)?

Any delay of these rules would be harmful in its own right, experts say, and they fear the announcement is just the beginning of further efforts to undercut coal ash regulations. During his first term, President Donald Trump largely ignored federal coal ash rules that took effect in 2015

That’s why alarm bells have been ringing for advocates following the EPA’s latest move to delay enforcement of one key aspect of the updated rules: the regulation of dry coal ash dumps and landfills, known as coal combustion residual management units, or CCRMUs.

On paper, it makes perfect sense: Putting old EVthe growing adoption of EVs while expanding clean energy storage at a discount compared to brand-new lithium-ion batteries.

Batteries, with their ability to instantly inject or absorb power, can also compete to provide various other forms of grid-stabilizing services in the ERCOT

The expansion draws on the company’s five-year track record of operating second-life batteries on the grid, and making money at it.

Around the world, farmers are retooling their land to harvest the hottest new commodity: sunlight. As the price of renewable energy technology has plummeted and water has gotten more scarce, growers are fallowing acreage and installing solar panels. Some are even growing crops beneath them, which is great for plants stressed by too many rays. Still others are letting that shaded land go wild, providing habitat for pollinators and fodder for grazing livestock.
According to a 25
On average, that energy savings and revenue added up to $124000252550000027“1012
The Central Valley is among the most productive agricultural regions in the world: It makes up just 1
Farmers can’t make their crops less thirsty, so many have been converting some of their acreage to solar. The Central Valley is ideal for this, being mostly flat and very sunny, hence the agricultural productivity. At the same time, farmers have been getting good rates for the electricity that they offset and that they send back to the grid.
Now, though, California has adopted standards that reduce those rates by “
Also, the study found that by fallowing land for solar panels, food production in the Central Valley dropped by enough calories to feed 86000
The tension, though, is meeting those objectives while still producing incredible quantities of food. “
But this isn’t an either-or proposition: Many farmers are finding ways to grow some crops, like leafy greens and berries, under the panels. The shade reduces evaporation from the soil, allowing growers to water less often. In turn, a wetted landscape cools the panels, which improves their efficiency. “
Farmers are also turning livestock loose to graze under their panels. Their droppings fertilize the soil, leading to more plant growth and more flowers that support native pollinators. ““
Then, if a farmer decides not to replace the solar panels at the end of their lifespan — usually around 2530““

The cost of keeping California’s power grid up and running is skyrocketing, and in turn, “
So finds a “
One of the main reasons utilities’ expenses are rising is that the companies are putting more money toward their distribution grids — the poles, wires, and transformers that deliver power from electrical substations to homes.
Spending on distribution grids has grown rapidly in the past decade, and made up 442023
The distribution grid is an even greater expense in California, according to Ric O’Connell, founding executive director of GridLab. Utilities there must invest heavily in wildfire-prevention measures, and the state’s ambitious decarbonization goals mean the power system needs to support the rapid electrification of homes and vehicles.
If California can defer upgrades to its distribution system, it can produce savings for customers, O’Connell said.
““
And according to GridLab’s new study, the best way to defer the most upgrades is to find those grid sweet spots — specifically, the areas with circuits, transformers, and substations that are least
Kevala, the startup that partnered with GridLab on the study, has a decent idea of where those sweet spots might be, based on its past analyses of distribution grids in California and
The new study looks at the ideal way to deploy the 35“
For the research, Kevala compiled data on every feeder line, substation transformer, and substation of California’s three biggest utilities from today through 203035GWVPP
That last technique was by far the most cost-effective, the analysis showed. Putting it into practice could reduce grid costs passed on to utility customers by a total of $137203010
The reason? Taking on the least overloaded circuits first allows the same amount of load flexibility to defer new investments across a wider swath of the low-voltage grid, O’Connell said. The strategy also happens to target more urban areas, where much of the grid is buried underground, making it more expensive and difficult to upgrade.
## Reversing the status-quo approach for ​“
That result came as something of a surprise.
“““
VPPs may also struggle to meet the challenge of deferring investments in the most strained parts of the grid, he noted. The history of these efforts appears to bear that out.
For more than a decade, utilities and regulators have been working on so-called “2014“
But beyond some showcase projects like New York utility Con Edison’s “
On the other hand, ““
Targeting the least overloaded circuits could also minimize the risk of VPPs falling short of the job, he said. Slightly overloaded transformers and power lines can undergo overload conditions for short periods of time without blowing up or breaking down.
Larger-scale non-wires alternative projects like those that have been targeted in the past have a slimmer margin of error, he said. Utilities have traditionally demanded that any DERs being deployed to solve those grid constraints be made available for that purpose to the exclusion of any other use.
That’s a tough sell for customers of the companies putting VPPs together. Most consumers buy batteries for emergency backup power or to store surplus solar power — not to turn them over completely to utility control.

The fundamental issue is utilities have the wrong incentives. They receive more profit by doing something poorly (more infrastructure / cost) then do something well (efficient deployment of infrastructure). This is easily fixed should the regulatory bodies do their jobs well. But most don't, they focus on the politics, instead of meeting customer needs. And of course, one of the key's is overbuilding so there are never shortages. But with batteries as a flexible backup, the overbuilding is no longer necessary as it was in the past. But there's no profit in running efficiently and paying millions of service providers who also are your customers.

""Utilities have traditionally demanded that any DERs being deployed to solve those grid constraints be made for that purpose to the exclusion of any other use."" Not only is that demand untenable to many of us owners of RTS, but another huge problem is the prices owners of RTS receive from PG&E. For example, under NEM 3 PG&E pays owners of RTS $.05 per KWH for extra electrons and and sells those electrons to a neighbor next door or across the street for $.45 per KWH. RTS owners are at the mercy of PG&E and the sycophant PUC regarding pricing. Owners would have no leverage.

Utility monopolies, wealthy AI developers, cheap watt sucking CryptoPunks who got kicked out of China in 2022, and VPPs are not going to solve this.
If cities & towns want to accelerate their local energy transition to benefit all their ordinary rate payers, they just need to mandate solar parking lot canopy microgrids at ALL the existing, widely distributed, large, hot, asphalt parking lots within their jurisdiction, within 5 years. Solar canopies +non-flammable BESS +Vehicle-2-BESS chargers, right where most rate payers live, work & commute from large apartments, condos & single-family neighborhoods to shopping centers, business parks & various municipal facilities, like hospitals & community colleges.
No new utility monopoly transmission, site acquisition, or other site improvement spending required. And no permitting & interconnection delays or armies of litigious NIMBYS. And remember, all those big hot asphalt parking lots in your town were mandated by local government. All perfectly legal.
For a commercial solar canopy micro grid system costing $1 million, a 30% Federal Investment Tax Credit, MACRS accelerated depreciation, and an SGIP battery rebate reduce the net cost to about $470k, resulting in a payback period of less than 4 years. Even without subsidies, the payback is less than 8 years. The benefits are so obvious that all the new healthcare facilities in my county have already shaded 80% of their big parking lots with solar canopies. Mundane Solar Abundance,....They're already getting it.

Community groups in Gary advocate for transitioning to a low-carbon steel manufacturing process instead of maintaining coal-based facilities. Despite environmental pressures, U.S. Steel and other U.S. steelmakers are largely committed to ongoing coal-related operations, with some planning to reline existing furnaces or build cleaner facilities in the future.

The bill is passed the House in May by just one vote.
Clean energy is the cheapest and easiest way to get power onto the grid. With demand for electricity nationwide rising due in large part to AI, swiftly bringing affordable energy online is more crucial than ever.
But if tax incentives are repealed, fewer solar, wind, and storage projects will be built. Between now and 20355772
Rising power demand plus slower power-plant construction is a recipe for higher electricity bills.
Households and businesses in Wyoming, Illinois, and New Mexico would see the biggest jump in energy costs should the tax credits be repealed. Nationwide, electricity prices would increase by an average of 73106increasingly steep energy costs Americans face.
The biggest loss, however, would be for attempts to decarbonize the U.S. power system. The Inflation Reduction Act, the U.S.’s first real stab at climate policy, had put the country nearly on track to cut carbon emissions in line with global climate commitments. Under this bill, however, U.S. efforts to move away from fossil fuels are certain to be slowed — even as the rest of the world speeds ahead toward clean power.

At peak output, the company expects the facility to be among the largest solar recycling plants in the nation.
OnePlanet’s ambitious plans rest on its unique solar recycling process. The company uses existing technologies but developed a proprietary workflow for divvying panels by shape, model, and physical integrity before crushing, grinding, and chemically treating the hardware to extract raw materials.

Employing artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art sensors, OnePlanet can recover not just the panels’ glass, plastic, and silicon but up to 97

Pujadas previously worked at the steelmaker Nucor, which led the U.S. industry’s adoption of electric arc furnaces. The technology turns scrap metal into new steel using electricity, offering a lower-carbon alternative to fresh steel generated from iron ore in a coal-based blast furnace. That experience taught Pujadas about where costs can mount in a supply chain and how much value a firm can create by freeing feedstock from contaminants.
Compared to that of other recyclers, OnePlanet’s approach will save the company money on maintenance since the pre-disassembly separation process avoids unnecessary wear on the machines, he said, basing the claims on the success of the firm’s pilot plant in Jacksonville.

Among the biggest challenges for recycling is finding cheap methods to transport panels to the processing facility. Shipping busted equipment from Texas, Pujadas said, is more expensive than hauling in panels from Puerto Rico. The location near Jacksonville not only has access to a Class I railroad and a port, he said, but to a lot of local material from within the state itself.
OnePlanet is also getting some help from the Inflation Reduction Act. The company’s facility will be funded in part by a $145
Pujadas said “
““48 comes to fruition or not, it’s not going to prevent us from continuing with the River City project.”
While he said tariffs may negatively impact the broader economy, the trade levies are expected to raise the price of key raw materials like aluminum, copper, and silicon, for which OnePlanet can offer a new domestic source.
