This facility was officially opened in November 2023. Lithium chloride from Landau is then sent to Vulcan\u2019s Central Lithium Electrolysis Optimisation Plant (CLEOP) in Frankfurt-H\u00f6chst, where it is converted to lithium hydroxide.\nDuring his visit, Scholz reiterated the importance of geothermal for the future energy needs of Germany, describing it as a \u201clargely unused but very ecological option to ensure that we provide the heat needed for households and businesses in Germany.\u201d Geretsried and Potsdam.\n![]( Energy\u2019s Lithium Extraction Optimization Plant in Landau, Germany (source: Vulcan Energy)\nScholz also emphasized the need for a secure domestic lithium value chain in Germany and Europe and reaffirmed his government\u2019s commitment to support the expansion of geothermal energy, targeting 100 new geothermal projects by 2030.\n\u201cThe idea that we have to import lithium from many countries far away from us keeps cropping up, and we are dependent on those who sell it to us. In fact, in Europe, but especially in Germany, we have the foundations to be able to produce this raw material supply ourselves. In addition, we have a great deal of untapped potential for a sustainable heat supply, such as deep geothermal energy, which could supply both households and industry with renewable energy. This technology is trendsetting. As the German government, we actively support this innovative approach,\u201d\n\u201cVulcan\u2019s mission is to deliver domestic and sustainable lithium to support Europe\u2019s green energy and mobility transition. The Chancellor\u2019s visit reaffirms the importance of our Lionheart Project as the most advanced integrated lithium and renewable energy project in Europe and gives us additional confidence that our work aligns with key policy priorities,\u201d\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Curbing emissions and supporting biodiversity ultimately supports public health by delivering less pollution, cleaner air, and cleaner water.\u201d\nTownRock Energy CEO David Townsend added: The sites we\u2019re exploring have been identified as potentially having the right geology for deep geothermal heat and power. This feasibility study is enabling us to look at that in more depth and build a business case with NHS Grampian for wider development.

    "Indicator":"An independent study by GNS Science reveals that New Zealand has a potential of 2000 MW of supercritical geothermal resources, particularly in the Taupo Volcanic Zone at shallow depths of around 4 km. These supercritical conditions, where water exceeds 373\u00b0C and 220 bars of pressure, could deliver up to three times higher energy output than conventional geothermal. Economic modeling suggests that exploiting these resources could become financially viable by 2037 or, more conservatively, by 2049, even at higher costs than traditional geothermal.",

Heat captured by the system will then be transmitted to a 25 kW heat pump.\nThe project is one of several planned under the partnership of Enerdrape and CIEC, announced earlier this year. The installation work began in October and lasted three months with a budget of EUR 100,000. Other similar installations are being considered by Paris Habitat.\nThe geothermal panel installation will generate about 70 MWh of heat each year, accounting for about 25% of the domestic hot water requirements of the homes, and avoiding the equivalent of 15 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year.\n![]( of geothermal panel installation in Paris Habitat (source: ENGIE Solutions France via LinkedIn)\n\u201cThis installation marks a key milestone in our mission to unlock the untapped geothermal potential of underground environments for a sustainable energy transition,\u201d\n\u201cWith the trust of Paris Habitat, committed to the decarbonization of the residential sector, and the key role of CIEC and ENGIE Solutions in the development and integration of innovative technologies, we demonstrate that bold and efficient solutions such as Enerdrape\u2019s geothermal panels can sustainably transform the production and use of heat in urban areas. This collaboration reflects our shared ambition to contribute to more sustainable and resilient cities in the face of climate challenges.\u201d\nEmmanuelle Copin, Deputy General Manager in charge of proximity and quality of service at Paris Habitat, added: \u201cParis Habitat, as a social housing company, seeks to implement solutions that allow us to control our tenants\u2019 energy costs and, on the other hand, to decarbonize our installations when technically possible. The project proposed by CIEC and ENERDRAPE for a first installation in France immediately interested us: the main advantage of this solution is to use geothermal energy without drilling on the land.\u201d\n\u201cThe proposed geothermal panels also create a less invasive construction site by being installed on the vertical walls of underground car parks while maintaining access to the spaces during the work. The expected gains in terms of energy savings and the ease of installation make this a solution to consider each time we study the hybridization of our gas boilers.\u201d\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![\u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 28 Oct 2025 \u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

We produced a compendium of all the drill bits used and how they performed.\u201d\nThe US DOE-funded Utah FORGE project is a dedicated underground field laboratory for developing, testing, and accelerating breakthroughs in Enhanced Geothermal Systems technologies to advance the uptake of geothermal resources around the world. Earlier this year, the FORGE team announced successful results from long-term circulation tests, indicating good connectivity across the stimulated geothermal reservoir.\n![]( National Laboratories mechanical engineers David Raymond, left, and Melanie Schneider pose in Sandia\u2019s Hard Rock Drilling Facility with a polycrystalline diamond compact bit. They recently completed an analysis on bit performance for geothermal well drilling. (source: Craig Fritz \/ Sandia National Laboratories)\nThe Sandia research team, led by Raymond and with mechanical engineer Melanie Schneider, analyzed drill rig data from the four wells drilled at the FORGE site, looking at the response data and post-operation photos of each polycrystalline diamond compact bit. Polycrystalline diamond compact bits have proven to be more cost effective than roller bits for oil and gas drilling. This compendium could help do the same for geothermal drilling.\n#### Analysis for better bits\nFour wells were drilled for injection, production, and monitoring at the FORGE site, primarily using polycrystalline diamond compact bits. These bits use the strength of lab-made diamonds in the form of disc-shaped cutters. Many of these cutters are embedded into the bit in a specific arrangement designed to best cut the rock. The industrial diamonds in these bits are tiny, grown in a lab for strength rather than aesthetics.\nTo evaluate drill bit performance, the Sandia team collected data on four key parameters \u2014 the force applied to the drill bit by the rig, the rotation speed set by operators, the drilling speed, and the power needed to achieve that speed \u2014 and inserted those numbers into a computer model. They used the algorithm to model the interaction between the drill bit and the rock, comparing that with the response of a single standardized diamond cutter.\nVideo Player\n00:00\n00:00\n00:00\nDrilling costs were also considered by the team, analyzing the balance between drilling speed and distance drilled and how that plays into the cost per foot drilled by each bit. One of the leading costs in geothermal well drilling is the daily expense of renting a drill rig, Raymond said. However, Schneidier emphasized that this doesn\u2019t mean drilling faster is always the most cost-effective solution. Depending on the depth already drilled and the time taken to get a fresh bit to the bottom of the well, a slower, steadier approach may be more cost effective, Raymond added.\n\u201cA big cost is truly how long it takes to get in and out of the hole when you\u2019re at depth,\u201d\u201cA key take-away from our reporting is it\u2019s not necessarily about going fast or with more force; it\u2019s about trying to extend the bit\u2019s life and getting the most out of each one. We\u2019re already seeing a huge improvement in drilling performance throughout the course of the four wells at FORGE.\u201d\n#### A history of work on diamond bits\nThe history of diamond-based drill bits is closely intertwined with the Sandia National Laboratories. In the early 1980s, at the advent of synthetic diamond manufacturing, the US DOE sponsored research at the Sandia to develop diamond-based drill bits for drilling in geothermal systems.\nSandia researchers, led by David Glowka tested diamond cutters from various manufacturers in the lab, measuring the forces required to scratch rock depending on the cutting angle and other parameters. Data from these experiments were fed into a computer model that allowed for the simulation of forces on any drill bit design. This code was then publicly released and provided to drill bit companies to inform the design of cutters on their bits, which was instrumental in catalyzing the industry.\nThe oil and gas industry has since then widely adopted the use of diamond bits. However, there were challenges remaining in drilling in geothermal sites, such as the high temperature and hard rock causing the drill bits to wear out too quickly. Sandia has continues refining diamond bits for geothermal drilling over the years, doing computational modeling of specific vibrations in hard rocks, and participating in field tests to improve diamond bit usage in extremely hard rock.\nRaymond hopes this compendium of bit performance at the FORGE site will help bit manufacturers in designing even better performing bits and assist geothermal well drillers in selecting the best bits for their conditions. Both should help reduce startup costs for steady, clean electricity-producing geothermal power plants.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long road getting to this point where polycrystalline diamond compact bits are a viable solution for geothermal drilling,\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not intuitively obvious how you should place the cutters across the bit to balance speed and lifetime, but that is what our analysis has accomplished. There\u2019s an incredible wealth of information here on what worked and what didn\u2019t work on these synthetic diamond bits.\u201d\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![SLB and Ormat partner to fast-track development of integrated geothermal assets 27 Oct 2025 SLB and Ormat partner to fast-track development of integrated geothermal assets ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development 27 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![BLM Nevada geothermal lease sale nets over USD 9 million in bids on 86 parcels 23 Oct 2025 BLM Nevada geothermal lease sale nets over USD 9 million in bids on 86 parcels ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program 22 Oct 2025 Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards 17 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program 15 Oct 2025 California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University 2 Oct 2025 PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Turboden to deliver ORC systems for Phase II of Cape Station geothermal project in Utah 2 Oct 2025 Turboden to deliver ORC systems for Phase II of Cape Station geothermal project in Utah ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![XGS Energy completes 3000-hour operations of geothermal technology in Coso, California 30 Sep 2025 XGS Energy completes 3000-hour operations of geothermal technology in Coso, California ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells 25 Sep 2025 Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Quaise holds public demonstration of millimeter wave technology for geothermal drilling 22 Sep 2025 Quaise holds public demonstration of millimeter wave technology for geothermal drilling ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The study \u201cPermeability partitioning through the brittle-to-ductile transition and its implications for supercritical geothermal reservoirs\u201d by Meyer et al\nThis guest article by\nNew laboratory data has been published to support the potential of superhot geothermal as a game-changer for renewable energy development and the replacement of a significant amount of fossil fuels for energy production. The data, reported in the journal\nSuch fractures are important because water passing through them can become supercritical, allowing them to penetrate fractures more easily and have 5 to 10 times higher density compared to sub-critical geothermal fluids. This is one of many factors that led to the description of superhot geothermal as the \u201choly grail\u201d of geothermal resources, notably by the Clean Air Task Force in a report published on 2021.\nThe data also show that rock that fractures at superhot conditions can be ten times more permeable than rock that fractures at conditions closer to the Earth\u2019s surface, and can also deform more readily. Those factors could make this geothermal resource \u201cmuch more economic,\u201d says Geoffrey Garrison, Vice President of Operations for\n#### A Geological Debate\nUntil now, geologists had been divided as to whether this superdeep, superhot resource can be tapped. Rock under such high pressures and temperatures\u2014more than 375o o\nThe current work, led by a team at the\n\u201cThere are also lots of other data coming out of this work that will inform our approach to tapping the resource,\u201d\u201chow strong is the rock? How far do the fractures go? How many fractures can we create?\u201d\n\u201cAll of this will help us derisk the drilling involved, which is very expensive. You don\u2019t get a lot of chances. You don\u2019t get to drill a hole then, like hanging a picture, move it over if you\u2019ve missed the best location.\n#### \u201cExciting Finding\u201d\nPeter Massie is director of the Geothermal Energy Office at the Nature CommunicationsX\n\u201cExciting finding: extreme heat & pressure can help create better enhanced geothermal systems [EGS]. At very high temps, rocks become ductile (plasticky), which was expected to impede EGS. This supports [the] prospect of ultradeep, \u2018supercritical\u2019 geothermal with major boost in output.\u201d\nThe research was led by Associate Professor\n\u201cThis work is exciting because it presents the first permeability measurements conducted during deformation at pressure and temperature conditions characteristic of deep supercritical geothermal reservoirs near the brittle-to-ductile transition in the crust.\n\u201cWe have shown that the brittle-to-ductile transition is not a cutoff for fluid circulation in the crust, which is promising for the exploitation of deep geothermal reservoirs. There are very few in situ data available, and these are among the first experimental results that shed light on such extreme conditions.\u201d\nViolay\u2019s coauthors of the Nature Communications\n#### What\u2019s Happening?\nThe consistency of superhot, superdeep rock is similar to that of Silly Putty. \u201cIf you pull it slowly, it stretches out and becomes elastic. But if you pull a chunk of Silly Putty really quickly, it snaps. And that is brittle behavior,\u201d\nIn other words, he continues, \u201cif you stress the rock slowly enough under these extreme conditions, it may stretch and not fracture. This work shows that rock will shatter under these conditions, but it needs to be stressed quickly to do so.\u201d\nThe research confirms theoretical work reported earlier this year in Geothermal Energyshowing that the cracks that form create a dense \u201ccloud of permeability\u201d throughout the affected rock. This is in contrast to the much larger and fewer macroscopic fractures induced by the engineered geothermal systems (EGS) in use today, which operate closer to the surface and at much lower temperatures.\nAs a result, the simulations involved in the Geothermal Energy\n#### Unique Experimental Machine\nGarrison notes that there are very few facilities in the world capable of making the measurements conducted at EPFL.\nSays Violay, \u201cThe best part [of this research] was the development of a unique experimental machine capable of reproducing the pressure, temperature, and deformation conditions of deep supercritical reservoirs near the brittle-to-ductile transition. Additionally, we were able to combine these experimental results with in situ X-ray images obtained the ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility), offering a comprehensive view of the processes involved.\u201d\nIn addition to Quaise Energy, this work was funded by the European Research Council, the Swiss National Science Foundation, The European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, and Alta Rock Energy.\n#### For more information, see the following stories:\nEPFL ( ) \/\nESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility) \/\nSource: Elizabeth Thomson via personal correspondence\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![SLB and Ormat partner to fast-track development of integrated geothermal assets 27 Oct 2025 SLB and Ormat partner to fast-track development of integrated geothermal assets ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development 27 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![BLM Nevada geothermal lease sale nets over USD 9 million in bids on 86 parcels 23 Oct 2025 BLM Nevada geothermal lease sale nets over USD 9 million in bids on 86 parcels ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program 22 Oct 2025 Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards 17 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program 15 Oct 2025 California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University 2 Oct 2025 PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Turboden to deliver ORC systems for Phase II of Cape Station geothermal project in Utah 2 Oct 2025 Turboden to deliver ORC systems for Phase II of Cape Station geothermal project in Utah ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![XGS Energy completes 3000-hour operations of geothermal technology in Coso, California 30 Sep 2025 XGS Energy completes 3000-hour operations of geothermal technology in Coso, California ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells 25 Sep 2025 Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Quaise holds public demonstration of millimeter wave technology for geothermal drilling 22 Sep 2025 Quaise holds public demonstration of millimeter wave technology for geothermal drilling ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

These technologies are important but underutilized solutions for supporting a more resilient and efficient national energy system, as well as reducing emissions from buildings. Widespread deployment of geothermal heat pumps (GHPs) can help reduce peak electricity demand while also generating savings for both utilities and ratepayers.\nKey findings from the Geothermal Heating and Cooling Liftoff report include:\n* The proposed pathway to commercial-scale adoption of geothermal heating and cooling technologies relies first on scaling geothermal heat pump (GHP) installations in new constructions through 2035, thereafter increasing the focus on retrofits of existing buildings. New builds present lower barriers for installation but represent a smaller market segment.\n* A near-term target of GHP installation in 7 million homes will require an investment between USD 100 \u2013 150 billion of capital. Broad market penetration by 2050 can be achieved by an annual ~10% growth, reaching an equivalent of 36 million homes by 2050. These goals will require a robust GHP workforce growth, more efficient installations, and simplified permitting, certification, and utility rate and incentive programs.\n* Tax incentives, utility incentives, and energy savings play a crucial role in helping customers offset the initial cost of GHP systems.\nTo complement the report, the US DOE will be hosting a webinar on 16 January on the topic of geothermal heating and cooling featuring senior DOE leadership.\n![]( of a geothermal district heating and cooling system using geothermal heat pumps (source: US Department of Energy)\nThe release of this Liftoff Report follows the 2024 release of the Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Next-Generation Geothermal Power report and DOE\u2019s 2023 release of an analysis highlighting impacts of mass deployment of GHPs, including the potential to reduce electricity demand by up to 13% by 2050 relative to decarbonizing without GHPs and avoiding as much as 43,500 miles of new transmission lines.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program 22 Oct 2025 Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya 6 Oct 2025 Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![T\u00fcrkiye hosts German delegation to showcase geothermal expertise, technology, and development 2 Oct 2025 T\u00fcrkiye hosts German delegation to showcase geothermal expertise, technology, and development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Cornish Lithium raises \u00a335m equity funding to advance UK lithium and geothermal projects 29 Sep 2025 Cornish Lithium raises \u00a335m equity funding to advance UK lithium and geothermal projects ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Project InnerSpace launches geothermal cold storage project in India under funding program 25 Sep 2025 Project InnerSpace launches geothermal cold storage project in India under funding program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First Gen \\(EDC\\) ventures into Indonesia with geothermal investment strategy 24 Sep 2025 First Gen (EDC) ventures into Indonesia with geothermal investment strategy ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Startup developing CO2-based geothermal system completes seed funding round 23 Sep 2025 Startup developing CO2-based geothermal system completes seed funding round ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lithium de France secures \u20ac40 million funding for pre-industrial phase of geothermal lithium project 23 Sep 2025 Lithium de France secures \u20ac40 million funding for pre-industrial phase of geothermal lithium proje ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Altamin secures grant for research on critical minerals from geothermal brine in Italy 22 Sep 2025 Altamin secures grant for research on critical minerals from geothermal brine in Italy ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

These barriers include a lack of adequate public data to guide and incentivize geothermal exploration activities, financial barriers that impede exploratory drilling, and limited technical expertise in certain stakeholder organizations.\nThis initiative will build upon previous and ongoing work that has focused primarily on the Great Basin region of the United States and will support expanded efforts in regions such as, but not limited to, the southern Basin and Range, the Pacific Northwest (including Alaska), and Hawaii. It will allow for tailored approaches to accommodate the relevant regional factors such as resource type, climate, energy prices, community and local stakeholder values\/culture, data gaps, etc. It may also help to achieve economies of scale in procuring and executing capital intensive and highly technical field work.\nParticipants are expected to collaborate in identifying data gaps as well as prioritizing, planning, and executing geothermal data collection and dissemination activities with the aim of incentivizing and stimulating follow-up geothermal exploration and development activities. The focus should be on pre-competitive data, i.e., datasets that would benefit multiple stakeholders if not the entire geothermal industry. The goal is to make all newly collected data publicly available within a reasonable timeframe. A limited embargo period may be allowed, where necessary, to incentivize industry participation.\nConnectWerx, in partnership with DOE, will coordinate the collection of applications, selection of partnership performers, negotiation of Business to Business (B2B) Agreements, and administer funds. DOE expects to make approximately 6 awards totaling approximately $19 million with this initiative. It is the project lead\u2019s responsibility to develop and manage the scope, schedule and budget within the partnership. There will be a 20% minimum non-federal cost share requirement. It is anticipated that awards will range from $1M to $5M in federal share.\nApplicants are encouraged to develop project concepts that are scalable from the low end of this range to the maximum, thus allowing DOE maximum flexibility in making selections that will optimize the overall portfolio. This could be accomplished by describing two separate project scopes for a high and a low budget scenario, or by constructing the project from multiple independent tasks such that DOE can select a subset of the proposed work for funding without compromising the overall project.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program 22 Oct 2025 Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya 6 Oct 2025 Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![T\u00fcrkiye hosts German delegation to showcase geothermal expertise, technology, and development 2 Oct 2025 T\u00fcrkiye hosts German delegation to showcase geothermal expertise, technology, and development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Cornish Lithium raises \u00a335m equity funding to advance UK lithium and geothermal projects 29 Sep 2025 Cornish Lithium raises \u00a335m equity funding to advance UK lithium and geothermal projects ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Project InnerSpace launches geothermal cold storage project in India under funding program 25 Sep 2025 Project InnerSpace launches geothermal cold storage project in India under funding program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First Gen \\(EDC\\) ventures into Indonesia with geothermal investment strategy 24 Sep 2025 First Gen (EDC) ventures into Indonesia with geothermal investment strategy ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Startup developing CO2-based geothermal system completes seed funding round 23 Sep 2025 Startup developing CO2-based geothermal system completes seed funding round ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lithium de France secures \u20ac40 million funding for pre-industrial phase of geothermal lithium project 23 Sep 2025 Lithium de France secures \u20ac40 million funding for pre-industrial phase of geothermal lithium proje ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Altamin secures grant for research on critical minerals from geothermal brine in Italy 22 Sep 2025 Altamin secures grant for research on critical minerals from geothermal brine in Italy ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Technology\n# Solicitation \u2013 Novel approaches to geothermal power for US Air Force, Army, Navy\n!Solicitation \u2013 Novel approaches to geothermal power for US Air Force, Army, Navy The U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds (source: Gary' \/ flickr, Creative Commons)\n![ ](\n![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 12 Nov 2024\nA solicitation call is currently open for geothermal developers, technology, and service providers to work on projects with the U.S. Air Force, Army, and Navy.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nThe United States Air Force (Department of the Air Force \/ DAF) currently has an open solicitation call for novel approaches to generate electricity at its installations using geothermal energy. The call is open until 3 January 2025.\nThe official solicitation can be viewed\n#### Expanded scope\nAn amendment made to the original solicitation significantly expands the scope of the call, as well as the potential benefits to vendors deemed as qualified. The opportunity is thus not limited to Travis Air Force Base.\nAlthough originally published by the DAF, the Tradewinds geothermal solicitation has a much wider scope of benefits for the selected vendors. Those with submissions that are deemed \u201cawardable\u201d will be able to pursue geothermal projects anywhere in the world with the U.S. Air Force, Army, and Navy at any time in the future without having to engage in any further competition.\nThe process allows \u201cawardable\u201d vendors to to engage in iterative, strategic conversations with the Departments of the Air Force, Army, and Navy without having to worry about artificial solicitation timelines, thus also shortening the time for geothermal project development. This solicitation allows for multiple vendors to be deemed \u201cawardable.\u201d\n#### Problem statement\nDAF installations largely rely on off-site electricity to conduct its globe-spanning, national security missions on land and in air, sea, space, and cyberspace. Dependence on off-site electricity, however, creates mission risks, because electrical grids are susceptible to outages from extreme weather and cybersecurity attacks by determined adversaries.\nTo maintain mission continuity and comply with congressional mandates to maintain energy resilience for all critical missions at each installation, DAF is seeking novel approaches to generate electricity at its installations using geothermal energy, because it can provide, continuous, resilient, carbon-free electricity regardless of weather conditions. While current renewable energy solutions such as wind and solar can supply on-site energy, such solutions provide intermittent power and require battery energy storage or other solutions to maintain energy resilience, unlike geothermal energy.\nDespite its advantages, there are numerous technological and geological barriers to geothermal energy that have hindered the U.S. government\u2019s ability to construct a utility-scale geothermal facility on federal land to directly supply electricity to its missions. While newer geothermal technologies such as advanced geothermal (i.e., closed-loop) and enhanced geothermal technologies hold the promise of producing power without having to rely on naturally occurring, hot, underground, water resources, such technologies do not currently exist at utility-scale.\nGiven the recent introduction of these new technologies, DAF is seeking to conduct a business process prototype to determine whether these technologies are technically and economically feasible at DAF installations in the United States. Under the prototype, the selected vendor(s) would (a) gather data through geoscientific exploration, (b) map out the resource, (c) develop an engineering design for a utility-scale facility to produce electricity and green hydrogen through electrolysis to power fuel cells, and (d) propose a deal structure for the sale of the electricity and hydrogen to DAF and others.\nIf electricity production is technically and economically feasible, the prototype project may be considered further for future construction of a utility-scale facility for the production of electricity and hydrogen. DAF would not execute a long-term contract under the prototype to purchase the electricity and hydrogen commodities. Rather, DAF would execute a sole-source, follow-on contract only after the prototype has been successfully completed. Once the follow-on contract has been executed, construction of the facilities could proceed. DAF would not own the facilities, rather it is expected that a third party would own, operate, and maintain them. The government may also consider scaling a successful prototype to other DAF installations in the United States.\n#### How to apply\nInterested applicants will need to submit a video pitch via the\nThere are five required elements that each video submission must address:\n1. Identification of the Problem(s) addressed\n2. Description of the technology or service solution and its application to the problem(s) identified.\n* Technical: Approach to conducting any geoscientific exploration, remote sensing, mapping, drilling, etc., and integrating the data into a robust resource conceptual model. Identify any teaming that may be necessary to complete this approach.\n* Environmental: Details on plans for conducting all environmental analysis (e.g. National Environmental Policy Act). Identify any teaming that may be necessary to complete this approach.\n3. Potential impact of the solution if adopted by DoD\n* Examples: Provide case studies or examples on how to design a utility-scale facility (at least 5 megawatts) to meet and perhaps exceed the energy customer\u2019s electricity or hydrogen needs cost-effectively.\n4. Differentiation from other technology and service solutions which address the same or similar problem(s)\n5. Pricing Model\n* Financing: Details on plans for fully financing (100%) the prototype with DAF providing land, site control, and access to an installation\u2019s facilities for the prototype project.\n#### The DoD as a first-mover on geothermal technologies\nThe DoD is a risk taker and first mover on many cutting-edge technologies. Geothermal is the Air Force\u2019s number one energy resilience technology priority given its promise of being able to provide resilient, 24\/7 baseload power to Air Force installations. Thus, the Air Force created this process so that they and the other Services could be first movers and easily work with the geothermal industry.\nThe DoD has been very active in recent years in engaging with geothermal developers and technology providers. In late 2023, the DoD signed contracts with Eavor Technologies, TEVERRA, and Zanskar Geothermal and Minerals to evaluate geothermal resources and viability at their sites in California, Idaho, Texas and Alaska. This was further expanded in mid-2024 with contracts with Fervo Energy, Sage Geosystems, and GreenFire Energy.\nSources: Email correspondence\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards 23 Oct 2025 Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Arup 13 Oct 2025 Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Aru ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress 10 Oct 2025 Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya 6 Oct 2025 Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa 2 Oct 2025 The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels 24 Sep 2025 Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France 18 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! 17 Sep 2025 One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest 15 Sep 2025 Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees 12 Sep 2025 Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Therefore, we are defining suitable locations and areas for geothermal drilling within the framework of the target scenarios.\u201d\nOther renewable sources, including solar thermal energy, river heat, and mine water, were included in the study. River heat can potentially provide an output of 20 MWth and could be an interesting option for heat consumers along the Ruhr. Further potential is available from the dewatering of the former \u201cFriedlicher Nachbar\u201d mine.\nFor renewable electricity sources, the utility company has analyzed the potential of photovoltaics and wind power. Existing solar systems currently generate around 13.6 GWh while existing wind turbines generate 4.1 GWh. There is room for growth, particularly with a photovoltaic potential of around 150 GWh. However, daily and seasonal fluctuations will have to be considered for these energy sources.\nThe results of the potential analysis provide a valuable basis for further planning. In the coming weeks, Hattingen Municipal Utilities and the GWI will develop concrete target scenarios to systematically advance the transition to a climate-neutral heat supply in Hattingen.\n**RELATED: Updated map shows over 150 geothermal plans in Germany in planning phase**\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![\u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 28 Oct 2025 \u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

We\u2019re grateful that our investors share our conviction about unlocking geothermal for widespread scale, and humbled that they consider Bedrock to be the right team for the challenge.\u201d\nBedrock Energy has pioneered geothermal design and installation technologies, including advanced subsurface thermal simulation capabilities and an intelligent construction platform for geothermal borefield construction. The company\u2019s deployment teams use these innovations to install geothermal heat pump systems for real estate owners at faster schedule, higher accuracy and performance, and stronger cost efficiencies. These systems can range from single-structure commercial buildings to connected district systems serving multiple lots. By unlocking scalable geothermal heating and cooling as a resilient, always-on category of distributed clean energy, Bedrock aims to save billions of dollars for both property owners and utilities alike.\n\u201cGeothermal energy has incredible promise as an always-on, 24\/7 carbon-free source of power and heating and cooling. We believe that Bedrock Energy has developed several unique, integrated technologies that will dramatically open up the market for cost efficient geothermal heating and cooling of buildings and change the economics of this industry,\u201d said Mark Sherman, Managing Partner for Titanium Ventures.\n\u201cWith lighthouse expertise from the oil and gas sector, highlighted by co-founder and CTO Silviu Livescu\u2019s experience as the Chief Scientist of Pressure Pumping at Baker Hughes, Bedrock is poised for significant growth,\u201d added Albert Bielinko, Titanium Ventures Alumnus. \u201cWe\u2019ve been so impressed by Jos, Silviu, and the early lead they have established in this space.\u201d\nIn addition to energy savings, geothermal heating and cooling has an unparalleled impact on moderating power demand in extreme temperatures, bringing immense value to customers, utilities, and regulators alike. According to Oak Ridge National Laboratory1, adoption of geothermal heat pumps in 70% of U.S. buildings could avoid seven gigatons of carbon-equivalent emissions by 2050 and save 24,500 miles of transmission line construction by offsetting needs from the power grid.\n\u201cAmid the economy-wide trends of electrification across industries, reducing demand will only grow more critical in the years ahead,\u201d said Jenny Gao at Energy Impact Partners. \u201cWe need to electrify quickly, yet deliberately; Bedrock exemplifies this approach as well as any company we\u2019ve seen.\u201d\nIn 2025, Bedrock plans to deploy new geothermal systems across Colorado, Utah, and other Mountain West states. This expansion builds upon the company\u2019s recently completed project in Morgan County, Utah, and ongoing work on a district geothermal system coming online in 2025 for a new business park in Hayden, Colorado. The latter project is supported by the Colorado Energy Office, Colorado Department of Local Affairs, Northwest Colorado Business District, and Town of Hayden.\n\u201cBedrock has been an excellent partner in the design and planning of our geothermal system. We are excited to leverage their drilling innovations to help us supply resilient geothermal heating & cooling energy for a flagship economic development project in a coal transition community,\u201d said Mathew Mendisco, Town Manager of Hayden. \u201cTapping into renewable subsurface energy right on-site is key to expediting construction timelines, lowering energy costs, and creating resiliency in mountainous regions like ours. Geothermal may be a valuable driver of successful coal transition, and Bedrock will be a key company in making that a reality in Northwest Colorado.\u201d\nWe previously reported on the company\u2019s inaugural geothermal HVAC project in Austin, Texas.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program 22 Oct 2025 Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya 6 Oct 2025 Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![T\u00fcrkiye hosts German delegation to showcase geothermal expertise, technology, and development 2 Oct 2025 T\u00fcrkiye hosts German delegation to showcase geothermal expertise, technology, and development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Cornish Lithium raises \u00a335m equity funding to advance UK lithium and geothermal projects 29 Sep 2025 Cornish Lithium raises \u00a335m equity funding to advance UK lithium and geothermal projects ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Project InnerSpace launches geothermal cold storage project in India under funding program 25 Sep 2025 Project InnerSpace launches geothermal cold storage project in India under funding program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First Gen \\(EDC\\) ventures into Indonesia with geothermal investment strategy 24 Sep 2025 First Gen (EDC) ventures into Indonesia with geothermal investment strategy ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Startup developing CO2-based geothermal system completes seed funding round 23 Sep 2025 Startup developing CO2-based geothermal system completes seed funding round ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lithium de France secures \u20ac40 million funding for pre-industrial phase of geothermal lithium project 23 Sep 2025 Lithium de France secures \u20ac40 million funding for pre-industrial phase of geothermal lithium proje ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Altamin secures grant for research on critical minerals from geothermal brine in Italy 22 Sep 2025 Altamin secures grant for research on critical minerals from geothermal brine in Italy ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

According to the European Geothermal Energy Council (EGEC), geothermal energy can provide around 25% of heating and cooling consumption and around 10% of electricity consumption in Europe.\nDespite the favourable characteristics of geothermal, the industry faces several challenges:\n* There is often a lack of capacity in licensing agencies and cumbersome authorisation procedures;\n* Easily accessible geological data or data on energy use are also often lacking;\n* Due to a lack of technological knowledge, feasibility studies sometimes do not focus on the total lifetime cost, which underestimates the lifetime of geothermal power plants compared to solutions with shorter lifetimes, which may seem cheaper. Few countries provide statistics on the numbers of installed GHPs, geothermal district heating and cooling systems, etc.;\n* Financial risk reduction is typical for larger projects, especially new entrants, which carry resource and project development risks\nAside from geothermal\u2019s more obvious benefits as a stable and emissions-free source of energy, the locality-bound nature of geothermal also promotes the development of independent and self-sufficient local energy communities. This means that regions can reduce their dependence on both locally produced and imported fossil fuels, and reduces network exposure to natural disasters and human factors such as politics and war.\n#### Geothermal needs public and political support\nHowever, the EESC believes that Member State intervention is needed to sustainably promote the growth of geothermal in Europe. Government funding and incentives are needed to attract and de-risk initial investments. Changes in energy policy or financing are also critical in improving the economic attractiveness of geothermal projects.\nIt is necessary to accurately identify risks related to environmental impacts and to ensure that the construction of geothermal power plants is pursued with the involvement of local communities, thus increasing public acceptance. It is important to stress that the environmental and climate benefits of geothermal energy outweigh the risks as it is one of the best renewable energy sources in terms of land use, resource use and import dependency.\nThus, the EESC calls on the Commission to launch a European programme to assess geothermal energy production areas in order to meet its drilling data needs, as well as remove regulatory barriers to planning and permitting needs.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

This project aligns with its overarching goal to bridge knowledge, technology, and infrastructure gaps between participating countries. It also represents a significant step towards meeting Europe\u2019s climate goals, as set out in the European Green Deal.\nPoland has significant geothermal resources, primarily low-temperature, suitable for direct applications such as district heating, bathing, and industrial processes. However, limited infrastructure and regulatory hurdles have hindered full exploitation. Iceland, in contrast, has emerged as a global leader in geothermal energy. With advanced geothermal systems supporting 90% of its central heating and contributing 30% of its electricity production, Iceland exemplifies how to harness this renewable resource effectively.\nHowever, at the end of 2022, Poland operated ten geothermal district heating systems with a combined capacity of 123.4 MW, marking a 26% increase since 2019. Additionally, shallow geothermal technologies, including heat pumps, have grown significantly, with over 900 MW of capacity installed by 2022.\nThe FM EEA framework offers Poland access to Icelandic expertise, creating sustainable development and mutual learning opportunities. Despite progress, the geothermal sector\u2019s share in Poland\u2019s energy mix remains marginal. Challenges such as limited infrastructure, high initial investment costs, and regulatory complexities hinder further development. Meanwhile, Iceland has established itself as a global leader in geothermal energy. Iceland\u2019s geothermal resources support 90% of its central heating and contribute 30% of its electricity production, demonstrating the transformative potential of these resources when harnessed effectively.\nThe collaboration under the Geothermal Synergy project bridges Poland\u2019s aspirations and Iceland\u2019s achievements, fostering a mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and expertise.\n#### History of geothermal utilisation in Iceland\nIcelanders have utilised geothermal energy since the Saga age, and the first settlers of Iceland in the 9th century, though, for the first centuries, this utilisation was very localised and had low intensity.\nIn the Saga of Grettir the Strong, the protagonist swims from the island of Drangey where he was in exile to the mainland where he warms himself up in a geothermal pool now called Grettir\u2019s Pool. In the Laxd\u00e6la saga one of the main protagonists, Gudr\u00fan \u00d3sv\u00edfirsd\u00f3ttir, spends a lot of time in the warm pool that became her namesake. Geothermal pools were also used for cooking and washing clothes during this period, although this was only done as part of domestic life for those lucky enough to have such a pool nearby.\nAround 1000, the Icelandic parliament, Althingi, decided to convert the country to Christianity. The local waters of lake Thingvallavatn are icy cold, so all the members were baptised in a warm spring called V\u00edgdalaug (Consecrated Pool) near Laugavatn, some 25 kilometres away.\nLater, during the Sturlunga Age in the mid 13th century, one of the chieftains, Snorri Sturluson, built a pool called Snorralaug (Snorri\u2019s Pool) near his home at Reykholt. There is also evidence that he piped hot water into his home for direct use there. This is the first evidence of what might be called direct manipulation of geothermal waters or pools to benefit the population in Iceland. Before that, there is little evidence of manipulation of geothermal waters.\nDuring the late Middle Ages and the 18th century, Icelanders mined sulphur for export. They did this near geothermal areas, though mainly since that was where sulphur was mostly concentrated and easy to mine.\nSo, throughout Iceland\u2019s early history, geothermal pools and waters were used for various small scale, localised uses, from simple bathing pools to places of healing, for cooking or boiling food, washing clothes, and for more ceremonial purposes such as baptisms. The only large-scale utilisation came more from the sulphuric byproduct of geothermal activity than any direct use.\n![]( pool in Iceland (source: Geothermal Synergy)\nIndustrial, or large-scale use of geothermal, did not begin in Iceland until the early 20th century when farmers in Mosfellssveit, just north-east of Reykjav\u00edk, started to pipe geothermal water into greenhouses to grow crops and for other industrial purposes. In 1930, the Reykjav\u00edk District Heating Company first set up a district heating system using geothermal water to heat buildings. Among the first buildings to be heated in this way were the Austurb\u00e6jarsk\u00f3li school and Sundh\u00f6ll Reykjav\u00edkur, the Reykjav\u00edk Swimming Palace.\nWorld War II put a pause in the plans to exploit geothermal energy in Iceland further, but after the war they continued at a moderate pace. The first geothermal power plant was opened in 1969 at Bjarnarflag in the North-East of Iceland, at 3 MW. Following the oil shock of the early and mid 1970s, the Icelandic government decided to ramp up the development of geothermal utilisation for both heating homes and power production, following recommendations from a study done by the National Energy Authority in 1970.\nThe Svartsengi power plant (from which the Blue Lagoon gets its waters from), was commissioned in 1976, and the following year the Krafla power plant in the north-east started production. Svartsengi also provided hot water for space heating to nearby towns. From 1990 to 2017 five more geothermal plants have been commissioned, all producing electricity, but some also providing hot water for municipalities and homes. The combined MW capacity for these plants is around 780 MW of electricity and around 850 MW thermal.\nVarious small and large district heating systems have also been opened up in Iceland over the past 50 years, ranging from small scale operations where farms and greenhouses are heated up with a local borehole, to entire towns benefiting from a central, geothermal heating system. By 2020, geothermal energy accounted for 89.6% of the energy used for space heating in buildings in Iceland.\nIceland\u2019s rapid advances in utilising geothermal energy for the benefit of society led to her participating in the foundation of the United Nations University in the late 1970s through the creation of the United Nations University have received training in Iceland in all forms of geothermal exploration and utilisation from dozens of developing nations. Between 1991 and 2003, 14 Fellows from Poland received training at the UNU-GTP and went on to help build Poland\u2019s geothermal infrastructure.\n#### Geothermal energy in Poland\nPoland\u2019s geothermal energy sector has deep historical roots and significant potential for future expansion. While Poland\u2019s history of geothermal use differs from Iceland\u2019s, its resources offer unique opportunities for sustainable energy development. The country has been steadily developing its geothermal energy sector, particularly in direct use applications such as district heating, recreation, and balneotherapy.\nThe earliest evidence of geothermal use in Poland dates back centuries, particularly in regions like Ladek-Zdr\u00f3j in Lower Silesia and Jaszczur\u00f3wka in the Podhale region. Historical accounts suggest that hot springs were used for bathing and therapeutic purposes as early as the 13th century. The 19th and early 20th centuries saw increased interest in geothermal waters, particularly in the context of health resorts and balneotherapy.\nNotable figures in Polish scientific history, such as Dr. Ludwik Zejszner and Prof. Stanislaw Sokolowski, contributed to early geothermal research. Their work laid the foundation for the systematic geological surveys that began in the 20th century, identifying Poland\u2019s geothermal potential.\nThe modern era of geothermal development in Poland began with deeper exploration in the 1960s and 1970s. The first experimental geothermal wells were drilled in the Podhale region, confirming the feasibility of using geothermal energy for heating.\n![]( well at Zakopane, Poland (Source: Geotermia Podhalanska)\nOne of the most significant milestones came in 1979-1981, when the Banska IG-1 well was drilled to a depth of 5,261 meters, yielding thermal water with a temperature of 82\u00b0C. This discovery paved the way for the creation of Poland\u2019s first large-scale geothermal district heating system in Zakopane and surrounding areas.\nBy 1992-1993, the Podhale Geothermal Heating Plant (Geotermia Podhalanska S.A.) was established, marking the beginning of large-scale geothermal heating in Poland with the contribution of MEERI PAS 1st Experimental Geothermal Plant in Poland, 1980\/90s initiated geoDH and other geothermal uses in the country (Part of the Centre for Geothermics and Heat Pumps).\nToday, Poland operates several geothermal district heating plants, including:\n* Podhale region (Banska Nizna, Zakopane, Bialy Dunajec, Poronin) \u2013 one of Central Europe\u2019s largest geothermal district heating networks.\n* Mszczon\u00f3w \u2013 pioneering reinjection technology for sustainable use.\n* Pyrzyce \u2013 an advanced system for municipal heating.\n* Uniej\u00f3w \u2013 a model city for geothermal development, combining heating with tourism and balneotherapy.\nAdditionally, Poland\u2019s geothermal bathing and recreation sector has seen rapid growth. Facilities like Termy Szaflary, Termy Bukovina, Termy Bania, and Chocholowskie Termy highlight how geothermal resources can contribute to local economies.\nPoland has actively engaged in international partnerships to accelerate its geothermal development. One of the key initiatives supporting this effort is the Geothermal Synergy Project, a collaborative platform between Poland and Iceland under the EEA grants framework. The project has facilitated knowledge exchange, policy development, and technical cooperation, bringing Poland closer to fully utilising its geothermal potential.\nAdditionally, Poland is working towards integrating with the\nPoland aims to more than double its installed geothermal heating capacity by 2040, focusing on:\n* Expanding district heating systems in medium-sized cities.\n* Enhancing geothermal electricity production through pilot projects.\n* Integrating geothermal with other renewable sources, such as biomass and solar energy.\n* Developing regulatory frameworks to streamline geothermal project implementation.\nWhile geothermal electricity production remains limited, Poland is exploring advanced technologies to increase efficiency and economic viability. The lessons from Iceland\u2019s regulatory and technological success provide a valuable reference for Poland\u2019s policymakers, energy developers, and municipalities.\nGeothermal energy in Poland is at a turning point, with increasing investments, international collaborations, and a strong policy push toward sustainable energy diversification. As Poland continues to develop its geothermal heating and energy solutions, cooperation with Iceland and participation in European frameworks will be instrumental in accelerating innovation and market deployment.\nWith the right strategies and partnerships, Poland has the potential to become a leader in Central European geothermal energy development, ensuring a cleaner, more resilient energy future for its citizens.\n#### Comparative geothermal conditions\nPoland and Iceland have distinct geothermal characteristics, shaped by their geological settings. Poland\u2019s geothermal resources are predominantly low-temperature, typically 40-90\u00b0C, making them well-suited for district heating, balneotherapy, and industrial applications. In contrast, Iceland benefits from high-temperature geothermal fields, often exceeding 250\u00b0C, enabling electricity generation and large-scale heating systems.\nDespite these differences, the two countries complement each other in geothermal advancements. Poland can learn from Iceland\u2019s well-established district heating systems, reservoir management strategies, and reinjection techniques to improve resource sustainability. Meanwhile, Iceland can benefit from Poland\u2019s innovative integration of geothermal with multi-source energy systems, such as Konin\u2019s hybrid model combining geothermal, biomass, and solar energy.\nBy leveraging Icelandic expertise, Poland can accelerate the expansion of its geothermal sector, while Iceland can explore new applications of its technology in lower-temperature settings. This cooperation fosters mutual innovation and strengthens both nations\u2019 contributions to Europe\u2019s renewable energy transition.\n#### Objectives of the Geothermal Synergy project\nA key element of the Geothermal Synergy Project is the engagement of top specialists and experts in geothermal energy from Poland and Iceland to foster collaboration at the public authority level.

Peter Njenga, KenGen\u2019s Managing Director and CEO, stated that KenGen\u2019s power plants were critical in meeting the 2149 MW of peak electricity demand in Kenya for the period under review.\n\u201cThis impressive growth not only strengthens our financial position but also signals greater returns for shareholders now and long into the future, while enhancing our ability to invest in critical renewable energy projects providing more affordable, reliable electricity for our consumers,\n#### A continued push for green power\nKenGen has played a major role in making Kenya a leader in renewable energy in the African region. Kenya produces around 90% of its power from renewable sources and is aiming for 100% by 2030. In support of this goal, KenGen continues to build capacity in renewables in the form of solar power facilities, hydropower stations, and geothermal power plants.\nWork is currently ongoing for the rehabilitation of the Olkaria I geothermal power plant to increase its installed capacity from 45 MWe to 63 MWe.. Regulatory filings done earlier this year also indicated KenGen\u2019s plans of building the 80.3-MW Olkaria VII power plant.

In 2020, it was reported that Gruppo Hera will be taking over the Casaglia geothermal plant. This was excellent synergy as Gruppo Hera is also managing the district heating service.\nThe proposal will involve the drilling of an additional production well to supply more geothermal heating. A reinjection well will also be drilled, and work over of the existing Casaglia-1 well will also be done. The goal would be to increase the contribution of geothermal to the district heating system, which is currently only at 40%. The rest of the heat is supplied by a waste-to-heat plant and gas-fired heating plants.\nThe geothermal industry of Italy continues to seek for government support to end the decade-long drought of new geothermal power stations in the country.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The planners are assuming a capacity of 52 MWth from the future facility.\nThese big ambitions also come with significant investment requirements, estimated at EUR 260 million. Funding of around EUR 91 million for the project is expected. Germering is planning to take a 25% stake in the company, Puchheim at 15%, and the rest by other shareholders.\n#### Another attempt after previous failures\nThe situation of the two cities is interesting, in that both of them have attempted geothermal development in the past but failed due to different reasons. A feasibility study for geothermal had been done with Germering. Funding application was done to advance the work, but the project failed to push through due to high costs. In Puchheim, an early-stage initiative for geothermal heating was struck down by a citizens\u2019 vote in 2018 due to fears of property damage from seismic activity.\nWith the energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine and a stronger drive for energy independence, Puchheim Mayor is hoping that the citizens will now realize the potential of geothermal. Technology had also greatly advanced since then. As the administration expressed in a statement to the city council, none of the geothermal projects in the wider Munich area have caused any damage from seismicity.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Among the provisions in the draft law are proposals to simplify and digitalize the approval procedures, set deadlines to limit the length of the process, reduce the number of authorities involved in the process, and give heat pumps and heat storage greater weight in approval decisions.\nThe bill was first discussed by the Bundestag in early October 2024, with Bernhard Hermann (B90\/Gr\u00fcne) describing geothermal as a \u201ctreasure from the depths,\u201d and that at least a quarter of the heat requirement in Germany can be supplied by geothermal systems.\n\u201cWith this law, we are sending the industry a decisive signal to recruit more skilled workers and to ensure that projects can be planned more easily. We are closing a gap in renewable energy sources and are thus moving a decisive step away from fossil fuels. This is good news for climate protection and good news for a crisis-proof, independent energy supply,\u201d\n\u201cWe are very pleased that geothermal energy is receiving strong support across party lines. There is consensus in the democratic parties that the expansion of geothermal energy use should be accelerated,\u201d\nThe Federal Council (Bundesrat) also expressed support for the draft law. However, they recommended revisions to ensure that drinking water resources are not endangered by geothermal development. The Council also asked the Federal Government to examine whether it is possible to create relief in the emissions control law for seismic measurement campaigns.\nComments from utility companies\nAhead of another hearing by the Federal Government on the draft law, utility companies\n![]( operations at Graben-Neudorf geothermal project site, Germany (source: Deutsche Erdwarme)\nKarin Thelen, Managing Director of Regional Energy Transition at SWM and President of the BVG, said that the GeoWG provides an important first step for the acceleration of geothermal growth. However, it still falls short in several key points.\nThelen particularly points out the redundancy of approval procedures for geothermal, where the subsurface is governed by the mining law above-ground facilities are subject to the building law. This complicates the administrative process and should be amended under the Federal Mining Act. Moreover, the water law requirements for large heat pumps should be abolished.\nThe statement by Deutsche ErdW\u00e4rme points out that the time periods for project development under the federal funding program for efficient heating networks (BEW) are too short (1 year plus 1 year extension for Module 1; 2 years plus 1 year extension for Module 2). Furthermore, the company cites that there is currently a limited number of contractors and other skilled personnel for geothermal in Germany.\nBoth statements from SWM and Deutsche ErdW\u00e4rme emphasize the importance of funding of geothermal power and heat projects through the BEW, and projects at acceptable prices cannot be implemented without this funding.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Robin has taken great pride in developing a world-class technical team in Indonesia focused on a culture of empowerment, cross-cultural learning, and challenging norms.\nRobin considers her most significant achievement at Ormat to be her efforts to increase diversity within the exploration team at the company. She recognized that the traditional job requirements for field-based geologists were less accessible to many potential candidates, particularly women. Robin worked diligently to modify these requirements to make the roles more accessible. From 2019 to today, the Exploration team went from one woman to seven.\n#### Advocating for pro-geothermal policy\nRobin currently serves on the board of Geothermal Rising and Chairs the Foundations Committee. She is an active member of the policy, education, and finance committees and has spoken greatly on the complexity of the federal permitting process and how this has hampered the execution of geothermal projects.\nAlthough not originally a policy expert, Robin is now immersing herself more into that area. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to bring some of my experience to support the initiatives that Geothermal Rising is undertaking,\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a crucial time for geothermal energy, and addressing these barriers is essential for our progress.\u201d\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Geothermal research drilling in Strandeiland, Netherlands reaches target 1963m depth 15 Oct 2025 Geothermal research drilling in Strandeiland, Netherlands reaches target 1963m depth ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Chemicals is closer to the geothermal sector with new office in Izmir, T\u00fcrkiye 5 Sep 2025 Green Chemicals is closer to the geothermal sector with new office in Izmir, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Government backs geothermal project in Chinameca, El Salvador 5 Jun 2025 Government backs geothermal project in Chinameca, El Salvador ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Bill Gates highlights Fervo Energy\u2019s geothermal innovation 3 Jun 2025 Bill Gates highlights Fervo Energy\u2019s geothermal innovation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Bog\u00e1cs, Hungary implements networked geothermal heating system from spa water 23 Apr 2025 Bog\u00e1cs, Hungary implements networked geothermal heating system from spa water ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![World Bank announces $150 million investment for geothermal in El Salvador 31 Mar 2025 World Bank announces $150 million investment for geothermal in El Salvador ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![PLN NTT targets 198 MW development with geothermal focus 13 Mar 2025 PLN NTT targets 198 MW development with geothermal focus ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![MOU to push geothermal development in Sintiki, Greece 23 Jan 2025 MOU to push geothermal development in Sintiki, Greece ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Seismic survey for geothermal exploration to commence in Lucerne, Switzerland 8 Jan 2025 Seismic survey for geothermal exploration to commence in Lucerne, Switzerland ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Funding agreement signed for geothermal drilling in Jelenia Gora, Poland 3 Dec 2024 Funding agreement signed for geothermal drilling in Jelenia Gora, Poland ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Novel borehole heat exchanger design developed by ITACA researchers 29 Oct 2024 Novel borehole heat exchanger design developed by ITACA researchers ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling to start for geothermal greenhouse project in Simav, K\u00fctahya, T\u00fcrkiye 10 Oct 2024 Drilling to start for geothermal greenhouse project in Simav, K\u00fctahya, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

This map is at a constant state of change as we periodically look at how we can improve the data or keep it up-to-date. Our Top 10 geothermal countries from the start of 2024 also had plenty of traffic. Surprisingly, the 2023 version of the Top 10 geothermal countries still drew plenty of interest.\nCollecting our website data and coming up with a Top 10 list based on visits has always been a great way for us to gauge the level of interest of our readers. It is also our way of saying thank you to you, our readers, for your continued support for ThinkGeoEnergy. On to the Top 10!\n![](\nStarting off the Top 10 list is the submission of the planning application of Weardale Lithium for the phased construction of a lithium extraction plant at Eastgate in Weardale, County Durham, UK. The company had already successfully extracted lithium carbonate from geothermal brine at the site, confirming the viability of the resource. The application for the pilot plant follows over 3 years of work in the area including trialling of multiple Direct Lithium Extraction (\u2018DLE\u2019) technologies to find the optimal way to extract lithium from the geothermal groundwaters.\nLithium extraction remains one of the most interesting alternative revenue generation options for geothermal projects. Similar projects have become fairly advanced in Germany and the US, while early efforts are already underway in Italy, France, and Australia. Currently, commercial-scale lithium production from geothermal brine is yet to be realized but there is clearly plenty of interest in this topic.\n![](\nWith AI being one of the major buzzwords of the past year, it was inevitable that one of our articles mentioning AI would also be one of the top ten stories of the year. This particular story involves Indonesian geothermal developer and operator Star Energy Geothermal partnering with IT company Kyndryl for a project that aims to use AI to optimize\nTechnology based on rapid collection and processing of high volumes of data are already being employed in geothermal projects worldwide, whether in exploration, drilling, or power plant operations. Notable examples are the use of IoT technology in Indonesia and Kenya, machine learning for drilling in New Zealand, and AI-led geothermal exploration being pioneered by Zanskar.\n![](\nThere were lots of news stories on acquisitions in the past year, but one particular story resonated the most \u2013 the acquisition of the Lightning Dock geothermal power plant in Hidalgo County, New Mexico by Zanskar Geothermal & Minerals from previous owner Cyrq Energy.\nWhy was this story particularly interesting? Part of the intrigue is the growth of Zanskar that came with the acquisition. The company, previously known as a provider of exploration and subsurface characterization services, transitioned into a geothermal power plant operator. The power plant also complements their classical expertise, providing a facility for development and testing of new subsurface technologies.\nIt bears mentioning that ThinkGeoEnergy broke the news of this acquisition, and we would like to express our gratitude to Zanskar for trusting us!\n![](\nIt has been an absolute delight keeping an eye on the geothermal progress of Kenya in the recent year. Aside from the continued growth of Olkaria, we are particularly excited to see the completion of the Phase 1 development of the Menengai geothermal field. This story on the credit investment of the Development Bank of South Africa on the 35-MW development of Sosian Energy in Menengai is another positive step towards this goal.\nWith construction work ongoing on two geothermal power plants in Menengai, we are likely only a few months away from Kenya joining the much-coveted 1 GW club for installed geothermal power capacity. Yet, the country is only getting started and we expect to see plenty more geothermal power facilities to be completed in the coming years.\n![](\nThere are a few things that stood out in this story about Energy Development Corporation expanding the installed power capacity at the Southern Negros geothermal field. The first is the amount being allocated for it \u2013 it is a huge amount that will cover the drilling of new wells, construction of new well pads and surface facilities, and will even support the development of emerging technologies.\nOperating since the early 1980s, the scale of the Southern Negros geothermal field is already quite impressive. Its steam field can support up to 241 MW of capacity from 92 wells. The fact that expansion is still being eyed for it is a testament to the resilience and sustainability of operating geothermal fields.\n![](\nThe project being undertaken by Karsan Ramji and Sons Ltd\u2019s with Steam Srl as Owner\u2019s Engineer is unique and novel in several ways. For starters, it will be the first direct-use application of geothermal heat in cement manufacturing. There will also be a 4-MW captive geothermal power plant to supply the power requirement of the manufacturing facility.\nSuch a project expands the horizon of how geothermal energy can be utilized, particularly in hard-to-abate industries like cement manufacturing. This is also an excellent examples of how markets can be created for geothermal, attracting further investment and facilitating development.\n![](\nData, especially subsurface data, is invaluable when it comes to geothermal prospecting. If there\u2019s a way to access this data quickly and inexpensively, then that makes the whole project development process a lot more accessible. This article on a study done by researchers at the Stanford University that resulted in a temperature-at-depth model for the continental United States resonated with this need for easily accessible, high-quality data.\nThe good news about the US is that there is already a wealth of subsurface data from different sources. This new model gathers all this data and processes them using neural networks, allowing for reasonable prediction of critical subsurface parameters. Similar efforts are being done as well in other parts of the world.\n![](\nEmerging regions always make for very good stories to follow and report on. India has had excellent progress in the past year, with drilling continuing at the Ladakh site and detailed studies being done in the Arunachal Pradesh region. This particular project aims to evaluate the different direct-use applications of geothermal heat and is being done with technical assistance from Norwegian and Iceland partners.\nWe are of course not oblivious to the geopolitical significance of the Arunachal Pradesh region, which has likely drawn more interest towards this story. We hope that such conflicts get resolved quickly and peacefully, and that geothermal development becomes a tool for community empowerment and economic growth.\n![](\nAs one of the pioneers in geothermal power generation, the expertise of New Zealand in the field of geothermal is globally recognized and admired. While the country\u2019s geothermal power sector continues to grow, it is also working on more direct applications of geothermal, particularly for process heat in the Bay of Plenty region. Process heat in this context refers to heat used for manufacturing and processing products, something that is still predominantly derived from coal and gas combustion.\nProcess heating has huge potential for geothermal, notably because there are many industrial processes that use low or medium-grade heat. Such facilities also provide jobs and contribute in building a local manufacturing sector, thus strengthening local and regional economies. Such studies exhibit that heating should not be overlooked in the geothermal conversation. It has tremendous potential, has a lower technical barrier to entry, can empower economies, and provides quality of life improvements to local communities.\n![](\nIt\u2019s hardly surprising to see the groundbreaking Eavor-Loop project in Geretsried, Germany at the top of the list. This update, published in March 2024, states that Eavor has drilled a total of 7000 meters measured depth at the project site, combining both the vertical and lateral sections. There have been a few updates reported since, notably reaching a total measured depth of 8000 meters by the end of 2024. The company is now expecting to generate geothermal power for the first time at the Geretsried site in 2025.\nThe Eavor project has had its fair share of critics, but one thing that cannot be denied is that the project and technology has managed to capture the public\u2019s attention in a way that is quite rare in the geothermal industry. If proven viable, then this is a technology that can truly fulfill the promise of \u2018geothermal anywhere.\u2019 This is exactly what we aspire for in the geothermal industry, and we are eager to see the success of this project.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards 23 Oct 2025 Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Arup 13 Oct 2025 Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Aru ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress 10 Oct 2025 Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya 6 Oct 2025 Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa 2 Oct 2025 The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels 24 Sep 2025 Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France 18 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! 17 Sep 2025 One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest 15 Sep 2025 Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees 12 Sep 2025 Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

This was announced by Ana Lazo, Director of Field Development and Geothermal Energy at\nSome details about the planned geothermal drilling campaign in Durdevac were announced earlier this year. The plan is to drill a total of eight wells to confirm the potential of geothermal in the region that were first indicated by studies 30 years ago. The well in Durdevac will be drilled as part of the exploration campaign for the Lescan license.\nThe project is notable for having secured a geothermal exploitation license relatively quickly, which hastened the preparatory work needed to start drilling. \u201cWe received the license for geothermal water exploration in October 2023 and in less than a year we managed to complete all preparatory activities and start construction work on our first well,\u201d\u201cIn addition, we have also completed preparatory work for two more locations that will be tested one after the other in case the geothermal potential of the Lescan well is confirmed.\u201d\nJadranka Lesko, Head of the Oil and Geothermal Water Sector at the Ministry of Economy, explained that a geothermal exploitation license can be obtained in only two months, given that applications are done satisfactorily. \u201cThe slowness of the state administration is often mentioned by those who submit very poor quality documentation, which is why verification can take longer than 12 months,\u201d\nFurther funding support\nLjiljana Zornjak of the Croatian Hydrocarbon Agency acknowledged that the payback period for geothermal projects is quite long, and there is an inherently higher investment risk. For this reason, the Agency has launched a project that aims to integrate geothermal into the district heating systems of four Croatian cities.\nLovre Karamarko of the Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds also reports that four geothermal projects are set to receive funding from the Energy and Climate Change program. An example of this fund advancing geothermal in Croatia is the drilling of the Veliko Koronevo well in Bjelovar, which was completed in 2024.\n\u201cWe are now in the negotiation phase with donor countries Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein, which will finance future investments in the program,\u201d\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![\u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 28 Oct 2025 \u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The region\u2019s proximity to the range front suggests likely fracturing, a positive sign for geothermal productivity. Additionally, the presence of metamorphic core complexes at one of the project sites supports the potential for elevated temperatures and permeability\u2014critical components for a successful geothermal system.\n![]( location of basalt intrusion in the geothermal lease site of Ignis Energy in Nevada (source: Ignis Energy)\nIgnis Energy has indicated initial plans to conduct comprehensive surveys in the prospect area. Methods will include such as Magnetotelluric and gravity surveys, along with shallow temperature measurements and seismic assessments to accurately evaluate subsurface potential.\nThe company aims to tap into the vast conventional geothermal resources found across Nevada\u2019s Basin and Range region while remaining open to testing new technologies as they reach commercial maturity. This comprehensive approach to geothermal development emphasizes sustainability and innovation.\n#### Clear Lake Volcanic Field\nIgnis Energy has also secured a significant lease position in in Northern California\u2019s Clear Lake Volcanic Field (CLVF). This is a prominent location for geothermal energy, already with two proven geothermal sites, including The Geysers, the largest developed geothermal field in the world. Preliminary data suggests that the site hosts a high-temperature, liquid-dominated geothermal resource, with a potential capacity of 60-120 MW.\nThe CLVF is a region is marked by an unusually high heat flow, making it a prime target for geothermal development. Typical geothermal gradients in the area range from 4-6 \u00b0F per 100 feet, but certain structural zones experience significantly higher temperatures, with gradients reaching 10-30\u00b0F per 100 feet\u2014ideal conditions for geothermal energy production.\nSurface indicators such as gas seepages, thermal water, and hydrothermal mineral deposits, along with past temperature readings as high as 525 \u00b0F (274 \u00b0C) in an offset well, further support the site\u2019s geothermal potential. Future exploration efforts, including advanced geophysical surveys and additional drilling, will help confirm the resource and move toward development.

The greatest demand here is for air conditioning, industrial refrigeration systems, and supermarket refrigeration systems. With a share of 95%, cooling is provided almost exclusively by electrically operated air conditioning and refrigeration technologies.\nThe aim of the project is ultimately to demonstrate a viable path to a significant reduction in energy consumption in the provision of cooling and thus to reduce the emissions of climate-damaging greenhouse gases directly from energy consumption and indirectly through refrigerant leaks by around 50% compared to conventional systems.\n#### Industrial cooling using underground storage\nThe industrial partner in the project is Voltavision and operates particularly energy-efficient test laboratories, develops test bench equipment and tests battery cells and modules as well as high-voltage batteries for the automotive industry, for example, at its site in Bochum.\nDuring testing, high heat loads can also occur on the test systems for a short time. Cooling this process heat to around 20 \u00b0C requires a large part of the company\u2019s energy expenditure. The process heat is released into the surrounding air via a cooling water circuit, chillers and recoolers on the roof. This generally has disadvantages: the system itself is associated with high investment costs when purchasing it, and ongoing operation involves high electricity consumption due to the compression cooling.\n\u201cWhen the outside temperature is low, the cooling water of the systems is already cooled by the ambient cold in the air. This free cooling is not possible on very warm days, so power-intensive compression cooling must be used,\u201d\n\u201cIn order to increase the free cooling share to up to 100 percent, knowing that summers are getting hotter, the idea arose to use cold stored in the ground from winter in summer. After the promising feasibility study, we are very pleased to now be implementing the project together with Fraunhofer IEG at our location in the Bochum Technology Quarter.\u201d\n![]( representation of the concept of a cold storage system: The geothermal probes laid out in a checkerboard pattern can be controlled specifically to optimize the distribution of cold in the subsurface and the response behavior for the application. (source: Fraunhofer IEG)\n#### The pilot project\nThe MissEllyDEMO project will be the first to use a field of geothermal probes as storage for an industrial application with a permanent need for process cooling. Between 30 to 40 probes will be laid at intervals of 5 to 10 meters and up to 100 meters deep. A brine will circulate as the operating medium in the closed pipe loops, absorbing the process heat to be dissipated into the subsoil. The smart and predictive operating control will regulate how the probes are connected on a daily basis, for example in parallel, in series or in certain zones, in order to ensure optimal heat transfer during predictive charging and discharging.\nThe free and otherwise unused cooling capacity of the cooling towers is used to regenerate the cold reservoir. These therefore run not only for a few hours a day during peak load times, but continuously whenever the outside air temperature drops low enough.\nIn addition, the probe field designed by Fraunhofer IEG can also be \u201ccharged\u201d with cold from the night and winter by lowering the temperatures underground, which are usually between 11 \u00b0C and 13 \u00b0C, to temperatures just above freezing. This means that Voltavision\u2019s test systems always have enough sustainable cold available.\nThis prototype is intended to show how the dynamics of free, regenerative but volatile environmental cooling can be sensibly integrated into a real economic process. \u201cWith our geothermal probe storage facility, we are creating a cooling supply system for industry that meets the high requirements for security of supply and flexibility through the use of a seasonal cold storage facility, the introduction of environmental cooling and the operational optimization of cooling systems in the overall system,\u201d\nThe operational experience will also provide the development paths for expansion to other processes and other users. For this purpose, Fraunhofer IEG will create a digital twin of the system which provides scientific monitoring and planning for operational and design optimization.\nSource: Fraunhofer IEG (\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The method was applied to 24 shallow groundwater heat pump (GWHP) systems in five European cities.\nThe full paper by Martinez-Leon et al, \u201cNovel management strategies for optimizing shallow geothermal energy exploitation: A European urban experience perspective,\u201dRenewable Energy\nThe participation of the Geological Survey of Slovenia, the British Geological Survey, the Technical University of Munich. and the University of Basel allowed for the methodology to be applied in different shallow geothermal installations across Europe.\nThe management strategy is based on two alternatives proposed by the study :\n* Prioritizing higher flowrates over lower temperature changes\n* Prioritizing higher temperature changes over low flowrates\nThe optimization methodology is proposed with the aim of reducing the thermal impact of GWHP systems on urban aquifers. The figure below schematically shows the steps for optimization:\n![]( of the flow rate (Q) and discharge temperature (DT) optimization. (adapted from Martinez Leon et al, 2025)\nThree types of optimizations were proposed based on the intended use of the GWHP system with appropriate systems identified \u2013 cooling mode (Basel, Munich), heating mode (Ljubjana, Cardiff, Basel), or dual mode (Zaragoza).\nThe analysis of the data shows two important conclusions:\n* Increasing the flow rate and reducing temperature changes resulted in an average reduction of 1.48 \u00b0C in the discharge temperature across all GWHP systems\n* increasing the temperature changes while reducing the flow rates led to a reduction of the flow rates of all GWHP systems to an average 8.09 L s?1\nIn either case, the method allows for the optimal utilization of shallow geothermal resources without significantly compromising the energy supply. The method is particularly effective for regulating thermal discharges from GWHP systems where well relocation is not feasible due to spatial or economic constraints.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

A tender for the drilling work is expected to be announced in June 2025, looking towards a start of drilling in spring 2026. If successful, the four municipalities involved in the project can be supplied with geothermal by the second half of 2027.\nThe wells to be drilled in Vaterstetten will provide the supply for the inter-municipal geothermal heating project of Geo Energie M\u00fcnchen Ost (GEMO), a joint development company of the municipalities of Vaterstetten, Grasbrunn, Haar, and Zorneding. The company was founded in December 2023.\nEarly excavation work at the drilling site was done in February 2024 to search for potential archaeological artifacts. None were found, and the green light was given for further preparatory work on the drilling site.\nTobias Aschwer, Vaterstetten\u2019s environmental director and one of the two managing directors of GEMO, explained that the topsoil at the drilling site will be removed this spring. This cannot be done earlier due to the bird breeding season.\nAn EIA document filed by GEMO in February 2024 indicated a plan to drill up to four geothermal boreholes to depths of approximately 3268 meters (TVD) in the Parsdorf district of Vaterstetten.\nA report presented in 2023 states that the possible geothermal reservoir in the area hosts water at 95 \u00b0C and a potential thermal output of 21 MWth. This will be enough to supply the district heating networks of all four municipalities. Nevertheless, GEMO is negotiating an exploration insurance policy.\nJosef Mittermeier (SPD) noted that the federal government has committed EUR 18.5 million in funding for the project. The drilling alone is expected to require EUR 15 million.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![\u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 28 Oct 2025 \u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The project brings together Geosolutions Leeds, Northern Powergrid, LCP Delta, E.ON Next, Leeds City Council, and Star Refrigeration to tackle key challenges in the energy transition.\nUsing the University of Leeds\u2019 Geothermal Campus living lab, GeoGrid aims to investigate how long-term thermal energy storage can improve the energy system\u2019s efficiency and sustainability. With the UK\u2019s heating and transport systems increasingly electrified, thermal energy storage is seen as a flexible solution to address rising electricity demands, inefficiencies in renewable energy use, and escalating costs.\nBy integrating geothermal storage into the energy system, GeoGrid will explore ways to lower connection costs, reduce expensive infrastructure upgrades, and enhance grid resilience. The project also seeks to demonstrate how the interaction of geothermal systems with energy markets can strengthen the business case for district heating.\nDr. Emma Bramham, Lecturer in Applied Geophysics at the University of Leeds and GeoGrid\u2019s Project Lead, emphasized the project\u2019s innovative approach:\n\u201cThis collaboration will explore new ways of improving energy efficiency using the University\u2019s Geothermal Living Lab facilities. Storing excess renewable energy beneath the city could help the UK make better use of green electricity and accelerate the transition to net zero.\u201d\nSteve Newall, Innovation Manager at Northern Powergrid, highlighted the project\u2019s practical focus, stating, \u201cMore accurate demand estimations will make flexible energy use more feasible, expand electrical capacity, and reduce decarbonisation costs. We are now moving into the \u2018Demonstrate and Deploy\u2019 stage, where the benefits are becoming more tangible.\u201d\nGeoGrid reflects a broader effort to develop scalable solutions for decarbonisation while addressing challenges like affordability and energy system resilience. The project serves as a significant step in understanding how geothermal energy can support the UK\u2019s net-zero goals.\nSource:\nNote: This article was corrected to reflect factual mistakes in our original reporting.

This number currently only stands at 1%, highlighting the challenges of the sector but also its immense growth potential.\nThe report places a special highlight on \u201cnext-generation\u201d geothermal technologies such as Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) and closed-loop Advanced Geothermal Systems (AGS). Such technologies can greatly expand the geographical scope of where geothermal power and heating can be developed. However, early- and growth-stage investment remains a key enabler in allowing these technologies to achieve economies of scale and become cost-competitive.\nThe report also goes into the role of the oil and gas industry in providing the expertise and technology for the wider deployment of geothermal technologies and reducing the cost of geothermal development. Moreover, diversifying into geothermal also helps oil and gas companies and professionals by providing new business opportunities should there be a decline in oil and gas demand in the future.\nThe lack of policy support in many territories is cited by the report as one of the major gaps in geothermal development. While more than 100 countries have policies to support solar PV and\/or onshore wind, less than 30 countries have implemented policies specifically for geothermal. In this context, the report makes a number of policy recommendations that can help increase the visibility of geothermal, attract more investment, and mitigate the risks of geothermal development with faster permitting and financial schemes.\n![]( Executive Director Fatih Birol at the Future of Geothermal Workshop in Paris, France (source: IEA)\nStudies done for the report benefitted from the outcomes and discussions of a \u201cFuture of Geothermal Energy\u201d workshop held by the IEA earlier this year with more than 100 public and private stakeholders from around the world.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards 23 Oct 2025 Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Arup 13 Oct 2025 Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Aru ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress 10 Oct 2025 Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya 6 Oct 2025 Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa 2 Oct 2025 The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels 24 Sep 2025 Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France 18 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! 17 Sep 2025 One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest 15 Sep 2025 Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees 12 Sep 2025 Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

In addition to the drilling work, the contractor will deliver the well design, test runs, and training for the client\u2019s representatives. The total value of the agreement is EUR 14.5 million, of which the first well accounts for EUR 5.9 million and the next two wells for EUR 4.3 million each.\nHanjin D&B will drill the geothermal well using its water hammer drilling technology. The wells will be located next to the hospital area at Laakso\u2019s field. Heat from the wells will be led to the hospital\u2019s technical facilities, where the necessary equipment, including heat pumps and exchangers are located. This equipment will transfer the geothermal heat to the hospital\u2019s local district heating.\nFor a long time, the Laakso Joint Hospital project has studied a variety of possibilities to use geothermal energy as part of the hospital\u2019s heat production. The aim was to find the most ecological way to drill hard granite safely and to prevent the gaps and cracks on the rock surface from being filled with drilling sludge.\nThe water hammer drilling technology developed by South Korean Hanjin D&B is particularly suitable for this purpose. Once successfully completed, it will be one of the deepest geothermal wells to have been drilled in Finland to date, and the deepest drilled with a water hammer technology in Europe.\n\u201cGeothermal wells are ideal for a densely built city \u2014 a deep well doesn\u2019t take up space and it generates an unsurpassed amount of local environmentally friendly energy compared to commonly used geothermal heating. As with any new technology, it does involve risks, of course, with regard to issues such as bedrock quality at great depths and the heat production capacity of the completed well. These risks will be managed under the agreement,\u201d\n\u201cThe benefits of the project, if implemented successfully, will be so significant that both owners of the Laakso Joint Hospital project \u2014 the City of Helsinki and HUS \u2014 are ready to back it.\u201d\nThe Laakso Hospital area is being rebuilt by the City of Helsinki and the HUS.

The initiative is led by Danish geothermal developer Innargi and MOU between Innargi and Veolia Energia.\nSeismic surveys to map geothermal potential\nThe surveys will cover 60 kilometers across central and southern Poznan, using specialized trucks to send low-frequency vibrations into the ground. These vibrations, recorded by geophones, will help create a detailed geological map to confirm geothermal water availability.\n\u201cThe surveys will give us a better understanding of the hot water reservoirs beneath Poznan, allowing us to plan the project more effectively,\u201d\nGeothermal: a key part of Poznan\u2019s energy transition\nThe geothermal initiative aligns with Poznan\u2019s goal to decarbonize district heating by 2030, reducing reliance on coal. If successful, geothermal energy could provide up to 20% of the city\u2019s heating needs, with integration planned by 2029.\n\u201cOur strategic goal is to decarbonize Poznan\u2018s district heating system by 2030, i.e. to move away from the use of coal to generate heat and electricity. One of the projects to help us achieve this is the use of geothermal deposits for district heating in cooperation with our partner Innargi. Heat from inside the earth, which is a renewable energy source, has the potential to become part of our green energy mix. This is in line with our vision for the future of district heating, which goes hand in hand with the green future of the city and the continuous improvement of the environment and air quality.\u201d\nA Model for Sustainable Urban Heating\nPoznan\u2019s geothermal project could serve as a blueprint for other Polish cities, reinforcing the role of renewable heat sources in modern district heating networks.\nWith ongoing collaboration between Innargi, Veolia Energia Poznan, and the city, Poznan is moving closer to a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.\nSource:\nDisclaimer: The author is a former employee of Innargi.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![\u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 28 Oct 2025 \u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The negative votes argued that the EUR 29 million cost of the project is too high for the city, considering that profits are only expected after 20 years.\nThis disheartening result comes as a surprise for a project that has built seemingly positive momentum through the last years. In 2023, Bad Bevensen was one of two municipalities that had been selected by the State of Lower Saxony to receive a conditionally repayable grant for a geothermal pilot project. In 2024, a new company was founded to lead the geothermal development efforts, called Renewable Energies Bad Bevensen GmbH (Erneuerbare Energien Bad Bevensen GmbH).\nWith this decision, the company must now go through a liquidation process.\nSeismic surveys for the project were planned in 2025 in anticipation of test drilling. However, this had not yet been commissioned.\n\u201cIt was a difficult decision and I want to reiterate that we are fundamentally in favor of geothermal energy. Just not under these circumstances. We are now satisfied,\u201d\n\u201cWe evaluated and discussed the project for a long time. Now a project worth millions has been averted,\u201d\n#### Counter-proposal also rejected\nA proposal was presented during the discussion that will help decrease the financial burden and risk for the city. This would involve two investors potentially joining the project, taking over 49% of the company. City Director Martin Feller said that there was no signature yet from these potential investors, but there was a firm commitment to participate.\nHowever, the proposal did not change the position of the CDU and the FDP\/Gro\u00dfmann group on the project.\n\u201c[This is because] two potential investors (including an expert energy supplier) recently expressed their willingness to join the company and promised a complete heat supply for the entire town. However, they need several months to make a final commitment to review the data already available and the funding options,\u201d\nThe SPD and the Greens are still campaigning for the project to continue, even under the terms of the compromise proposal. \u201cIf we back out now, we will deprive citizens of the opportunity to have a cheap energy supply,\u201d\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t understand how you can jeopardize such a unique opportunity,\u201d\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

This even led to a shutdown of the Mezober\u00e9ny (Hungary) geothermal site. An on-site campaign was carried out at that site including a stimulation aiming to enhance the transmissivity of the sedimentary reservoir and the near-wellbore zone of this site.\nPrevious studies have concluded that insufficient injectivity may be linked to a high skin effect in the near well-bore zone and pore-clogging in combination with the low net sandstone content of the fluvio-deltaic reservoir. At other sites, chemical or biological activities are the reason for decreasing permeability during the operation of the geothermal plants. In Mezober\u00e9ny a chemical soft stimulation based on the injection of hydrochloric acid (HCl) was successfully used to unclog and recover the well injectivity. Hence, it is possible to retrieve favorable conditions and operate sustainably.\nWith a focus on Mezober\u00e9ny, several examples will be shown on the challenges and opportunities of using sedimentary reservoirs for geothermal energy production.\nDr Maren Brehme is a hydrogeologist aiming to understand subsurface fluid flow using multidisciplinary approaches for sustainable geothermal exploration and exploitation strategies with a strong focus on fieldwork and real-scale data. Maren\u2019s main research objective is finding new well locations during geothermal exploration and field development and on optimizing sustainable geothermal energy extraction and conversion.\nAreas of expertise are geothermal reservoir characterization, hydraulic, thermal and chemical data interpretation, enhancing reservoir performance and its sustainable use. Methods and findings are mainly related to geothermal systems but applicable in any geofluids environment (geothermal, CO2, H2, heat, drinking water).\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

An array of ten boreholes, drilled to a depth of 120 meters each, provides space air conditioning to the building, thus far being able to maintain indoor temperatures of 22 \u00b0C while the outdoor temperature is at 43 \u00b0C.\nThe building, designed and built for the Indian Army at CWE Jhansi, was built from the ground up to demonstrate the feasibility and benefit of net-zero technologies. The electricity supply of the building is primarily from photovoltaic panels, with a backup grid connection when solar power is not available. The ground source heat pump system is the only source of air conditioning.\nThe project was commissioned by the Military Engineering Service of the Indian Army, seeking to build a facility with an Energy Performance Index (EPI) of less than 50. For location, buildings in the city of Jhansi have a standard recommended EPI of 144. The building was designed and delivered by the large-scale geothermal heating and cooling system at the Leh Airport.

GEOTERM KOSICE will start the drilling of 3 new geothermal wells to add to the three existing wells in the Svinica-Durkov geothermal center. Miroslav Kavul\u2019a, CEO OF MH Teplarensky, stated that the project has been designed so that additional centers can be built alongside it in subsequent stages.\nEU funding for the geothermal project had already been announced in late 2023, with the categorization of the project as a \u201cnational priority project.\u201d However, this latest development officially sets the framework for project implementation.\nThis investment will help not just in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, but will also support job creation and the development of the local economy. In addition, the prices geothermal heating will be more stable for end consumers compared to heat from combustion of gas or coal.\nMichal Kalinak, State Secretary of MIRRI SR, emphasized the importance of the geothermal project in positioning Slovakia in the geothermal industry of the EU. The official states that having a geothermal project puts Slovakia in a stronger position to apply for new EU funding, as the country seeks to have higher geothermal utilization than what it currently has.\nI am pleased that in times when the debate about rising energy prices continues, we are bringing this concrete and strategic solution. I believe that the geothermal project in Kosice will also be an inspiration for other regions of Slovakia, because our country has a huge, but still insufficiently exploited, potential in this area,\u201d\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Technology\n# GreenFire Energy \u2013 A scalable and flexible model for geothermal growth\n!GreenFire Energy \u2013 A scalable and flexible model for geothermal growth GreenFire Energy - A scalable and flexible model for geothermal growth\n![ ](\n![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 31 Mar 2025\nIn this interview, Rob Klenner tells us about GreenFire Energy's transition to full-spectrum geothermal development and focus on behind-the-meter projects.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nOne thing that often escapes mainstream discussion of geothermal is the fact that there are already several technological solutions that work. In many places around the world, technology is not the bottleneck for geothermal deployment. Rather, it is the lack of a policy environment and business model that allow geothermal projects to be commercially viable.\nUnder the leadership of new President Rob Klenner\nIn this interview, Klenner discusses the changes in GreenFire Energy\n#### An evolving business model\nFor many years, the identity of GreenFire Energy had been closely tied to its proprietary GreenLoop closed-loop technology. The value proposition of the technology was sufficiently intriguing, seeking to generate geothermal energy from unproductive wells or in challenging geologies where traditional hydrothermal systems were not feasible.\nHowever, GreenFire Energy is shifting focus under President Rob Klenner. Technology will still be a core competency, but the company now aspires to be a full-spectrum geothermal project developer matching technology to the geology for each project. GreenFire has already set an interim goal of building a 150-MW geothermal power portfolio by 2030.\nAside from Klenner, GreenFire Energy has also had some leadership growth with the appointment of Derek Dixon as Vice President of Business Development, and Cory Draper as Vice President of Asset Management. The team brings decades of expertise in energy systems, commercial strategy, and project execution.\nBoth necessity and opportunity have driven this evolution. To enable geothermal growth, it has to provide dependable and clean baseload energy to both private sector stakeholders and government clients. This means offering bespoke technological solutions that are compatible with the needs of the clients and the unique geology of each site. Rather than continue solely as a technology vendor, GreenFire Energy is stepping into the developer role \u2013 identifying viable sites, selecting the right tools for the subsurface, building projects, and delivering power directly to clients.\nThe vertically integrated approach also positions the company to participate more fully in their projects, with more control over timelines, project outcomes, and client relationships.\nThe strategic shift does not mean that GreenFire Energy will be abandoning its technological roots. Rather, their patented AGS solution will remain one of the options that GreenFire Energy can offer their customers, particularly in projects where it presents a distinct advantage. GreenFire Energy is now expanding their business with more geothermal solutions that are flexible and site-specific.\n![]( Energy offers a range of geothermal solutions depending on geology and client needs (source: GreenFire Energy)\n#### Matching technology to geology\nA key aspect of GreenFire Energy\u2019s new business model is its focus on flexibility. Rather than championing a single technology, GreenFire Energy believes that geology should dictate the optimal solution for geothermal utilization. \u201cYou don\u2019t just drill a horizontal well everywhere because that\u2019s your specialty,\u201d \u201cYou match the technology to the geology.\u201d\nIn the geothermal context, this could mean deploying enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) or advanced geothermal systems (AGS) in impermeable formations, or revitalizing conventional resources with downhole heat exchangers. GreenFire Energy has already had hands-on experience with multiple geothermal methodologies, implementing closed-loop concepts at projects in the United States.\nThis technology-agnostic approach allows GreenFire Energy to be more responsive to project needs, resource constraints, and client expectations. This kind of adaptability is crucial in geothermal, where subsurface parameters may vary widely from one site to the next. As Klenner noted, future projects may even incorporate multiple technologies within a single development, perhaps mixing closed-loop systems with enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) where appropriate.\n#### Realigning to a Behind-the-Meter (BTM) model\nRecently, GreenFire Energy was announced as one of about a dozen companies that have been granted \u201cawardable\u201d status by the US Department of Energy for geothermal projects. This positions the company to work with the US Air Force, Navy, and Army to develop geothermal solutions for their branches and facilities worldwide.\nThe engagement with the US DoD is an excellent example of GreenFire Energy\u2019s pivot toward behind-the-meter (BTM), co-located geothermal development. This approach focuses on deploying geothermal power systems directly at or near the sites where the electricity is consumed, such as data centers, military installations, and industrial facilities. The result is a highly localized, modular energy solution that offers several key advantages over traditional utility-scale developments.\nThe BTM model enables the faster deployment of geothermal power projects by removing the dependence on a distribution grid, which often require regulatory and infrastructure considerations. GreenFire Energy is also open to developing smaller scale power projects when necessary. \u201cWe want to be agile and modular,\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on 5- to 25-MW projects that can be deployed quickly and scaled as needed.\u201d\nThe strategy of phased development also provides the added benefit of reducing early-stage risk and capital intensity. This provides a more accessible pathway to geothermal project development while still maintaining the flexibility to scale up given the right conditions.\nIn addition to the DoD, GreenFire Energy is pursuing projects with data centers, food processing plants, and even remote communities. Klenner notes that clients are less interested in the technology used for geothermal, but more on the reliability, cost, and emissions reduction that tapping into this energy source can bring. \u201cThey just want green electrons,\u201d\n#### A 150-MW portfolio by 2030\nGreenFire Energy has set an ambitious target of developing 150 MW of installed geothermal capacity by 2030. Rather than banking on a few mega-projects, the company is cultivating a geographically and technologically diverse portfolio. A significant portion of this future portfolio is expected to come from projects with the US DoD. GreenFire Energy is also exploring the concept of integrated energy parks, where geothermal is co-located with solar, wind, nuclear, or gas to create robust, multi-source power hubs.\nThis phased development strategy allows GreenFire Energy to build experience, de-risk technologies, and generate early revenue\u2014all while laying the foundation for larger-scale deployments. \u201cWe want our first 5 MW, then our next 10, and then our next 20,\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about building momentum while being smart with resources.\u201d\nThe company is also investing in early-stage exploration in areas with high geothermal gradients across the western U.S. These exploratory efforts aim to create a pipeline of future projects that can move quickly once permitting and technical assessments are complete.\n![]( Klenner \u2013 GreenFire Energy\n#### Strengthening support for geothermal in the US\nThe geothermal industry in the United States has steadily grown momentum in the last few years. Based on recent pronouncements from the Trump administration and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, geothermal appears well-positioned to continue to receive strong policy support. \u201cI think there is a tailwind here with the new administration, and it\u2019s good news for geothermal,\u201d\nFor GreenFire Energy, the vocal support for geothermal is a welcome development that aligns perfectly with the company\u2019s expanding vision. Klenner remains optimistic about both the current administration\u2019s support and the broader bipartisan consensus around geothermal as a critical pillar of energy security. \u201cGeothermal is bipartisan,\u201d\u201cWhether you care about clean energy or energy dominance, it checks all the boxes.\u201d\nHowever, Klenner also believes more needs to be done to elevate geothermal to the level of other emerging technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture. \u201cThe hydrogen hubs got $6 billion. If we got $6 billion for geothermal, we could build projects across the country,\u201d\nThe company remains active in global markets, including Kenya, Indonesia, and the Philippines, where it provides engineering services and supports local developers. These partnerships are critical to extending in international regions the technologies developed and tested in the US. Klenner sees this as a major growth opportunity in the future. \u201cWe\u2019re building megawatts here, but we\u2019re still supporting projects overseas. When the time is right, we\u2019ll develop internationally, too.\u201d\nBy putting customer needs first, GreenFire Energy aims to leverage technical versatility and partnerships to deploy geothermal projects faster. Setting new goals and business models, the company has had to evolve significantly over the last few months. This is par for the course for the geothermal industry, which has been more dynamic than ever in recent years. As Klenner put it: \u201cThings are always changing. GreenFire Energy has expanded our leadership team, refined our direction, and focused our strategy on domestic projects. If you don\u2019t change, then you can\u2019t move forward as quickly.\u201d\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards 23 Oct 2025 Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Arup 13 Oct 2025 Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Aru ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress 10 Oct 2025 Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya 6 Oct 2025 Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa 2 Oct 2025 The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels 24 Sep 2025 Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France 18 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! 17 Sep 2025 One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest 15 Sep 2025 Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees 12 Sep 2025 Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

This is the solution,\u201d \u201cThe effort to be made on this crucial subject, this adaptation, France has started it better than any country in the world. For me, this is a priority, an ardent obligation that must be pursued and expanded: plan the transition by finalising our low-carbon strategy; preserving our biodiversity; to produce, but in a carbon-free way, thanks to new technologies.\u201d\n\u201cI am thinking, in particular, of our energy policy. This policy has one goal: carbon-free energy accessible to all. To achieve this, nuclear power is an essential axis, and geothermal energy, an inexhaustible reservoir of free calories under our feet, is also an essential one.\u201d\nDespite having one of the most developed geothermal industries in Europe, geothermal solutions still only contribute only 1% of the final heat consumption in France. To increase the share of all renewables to 38% by 2030, policy support for geothermal in France has been strengthening steadily in recent years. Before the end of 2023, the Ministry of Energy Transition published the finalized action plan that supports the deployment of geothermal energy to meet the needs for renewable heating and cooling for individual and collective buildings in Mainland France.\nThe these words can only encourage all the players in the geothermal sector to continue their daily action for the development of this carbon-free solution capable of producing heating and cooling in our buildings.\u201d\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

A detailed report on the productivity of the well is expected to be prepared by the first half of 2026. If there are sufficient geothermal resources, then the construction of a power plant can begin.\nAccording to Academia Sinica President James Liao, it took 2 years to determine the location for the drilling of the exploratory well. Exploration methods including magnetotellurics, reflection seismic surveys, and seismic wave imaging were employed to establish a 3D model of the subsurface in the exploration area.\nIn 2022, CPC Taiwan and Academia Sinica signed a memorandum of cooperation for geothermal development, with exploration starting at the Honchailin area in the Sanxing Township of Yilan County. After two years of exploration work, the Yuanshan area was identified as the prospect for drilling.\nThe drilling in Yuanshan is only the first in a planned drilling campaign by CPC Taiwan corresponding to an investment of NTD 3.45 billion (approx. USD 107 million). Over the next two to three years, six wells will be drilled in Yuanshan, Tuchang, and other geothermal sites. CPC Taiwan emphasizes that it will drill and evaluate first, and that more deep wells will be drilled if necessary.\nYilan County has long been identified as one of the regions in Taiwan with plenty of geothermal potential. As Minister Kuo mentioned during the ceremony, the success of the Qingshui geothermal power plant highlights the advantages of geothermal development. Further geothermal growth in Yilan can make it a prime spot for data centers, thus also helping the local economy and making Yilan County a hub for digital centers.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya 28 Oct 2025 Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area 27 Oct 2025 Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines 22 Oct 2025 EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia 20 Oct 2025 Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia 17 Oct 2025 Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation 16 Oct 2025 China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated 16 Oct 2025 Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia 8 Oct 2025 Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia 3 Oct 2025 Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

By harnessing the thermal energy already present at the site, this approach bolsters the project\u2019s efficiency via converting what would otherwise be wasted heat into a valuable energy asset.\n\u201cFor too long, key public and private sector stakeholders have not had access to the technology and expertise needed to harness the vast, untapped energy resources beneath our feet,\u201d\n\u201cProperly capturing highly sustainable geothermal energy already present at active energy production projects presents a new avenue of opportunity for government agencies and leading commercial entities alike, and we could not be more excited to work with Chord to help deploy Gradient\u2019s innovative technology within this expansive, forward-thinking initiative.\u201d\n#### Initial installation in Nevada\nGradient Geothermal, then known as Transitional Energy, had initially deployed their technology at a pilot project at the Blackburn Oilfield in Nevada. The geothermal energy is used to power a portion of project partner Grant Canyon\u2019s operations at the oil field, reducing the total greenhouse gas emission from their operations.\n![]( of the HXC Geothermal System by Gradient Geothermal (source: Gradient Geothermal)\n\u201cThe water cut in Blackburn is more than 99 %; there is natural aqui\u00adfer recharge because of the rain that falls in the mountains on either side, which means there are no pumps to maintain, and the temperature of the produced water is around 130\u00b0 C. In other words, the operator knew that they had a geothermal resource on their hands,\nBurke further emphasizes the simplicity and the benefits of their approach. \u201cAll we do is put a heat exchanger in the existing production layout. The temperature of the injected fluid in Blackburn was always around 40\u00b0 C.\u201d\nGradient Geothermal was also one of the recipients of a state funding package announced by the Colorado Energy Office earlier this year for innovative geothermal projects. The $100,000 grant will go towards the evaluation of the viability of establishing a thermal energy network for the town of Pierce using hot water extracted from the inactive oil wells of the nearby Pierce Field\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program 22 Oct 2025 Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya 6 Oct 2025 Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![T\u00fcrkiye hosts German delegation to showcase geothermal expertise, technology, and development 2 Oct 2025 T\u00fcrkiye hosts German delegation to showcase geothermal expertise, technology, and development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Cornish Lithium raises \u00a335m equity funding to advance UK lithium and geothermal projects 29 Sep 2025 Cornish Lithium raises \u00a335m equity funding to advance UK lithium and geothermal projects ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Project InnerSpace launches geothermal cold storage project in India under funding program 25 Sep 2025 Project InnerSpace launches geothermal cold storage project in India under funding program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First Gen \\(EDC\\) ventures into Indonesia with geothermal investment strategy 24 Sep 2025 First Gen (EDC) ventures into Indonesia with geothermal investment strategy ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Startup developing CO2-based geothermal system completes seed funding round 23 Sep 2025 Startup developing CO2-based geothermal system completes seed funding round ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lithium de France secures \u20ac40 million funding for pre-industrial phase of geothermal lithium project 23 Sep 2025 Lithium de France secures \u20ac40 million funding for pre-industrial phase of geothermal lithium proje ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Altamin secures grant for research on critical minerals from geothermal brine in Italy 22 Sep 2025 Altamin secures grant for research on critical minerals from geothermal brine in Italy ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The sensors gathered data for 50 days between May to September 2023. The seismic data from the sensors was then processed to generate a 3D model of the subsurface structures within the study area.\nThe model indicates a highly fractured, fluid-saturated shallow geothermal reservoir in the Yushin district. Moreover, there is an observed crustal seismic discontinuity at around 4 kilometers depth, indicating a transition from the upper Bukit Timah granite to the porous metasedimentary basement. This could be a deeper aquifer that is feeding the shallow reservoir and, ultimately, the Sembawang hot spring.\n#### Future work\nWith these positive results, another passive seismic campaign has been proposed by the research group that will cover the northeast and south regions of Singapore. The future study site will cover northeastern Punggol Park, down to Ang Mo Kio, Tanjong Pagar, and Chinatown, and towards the south to Bukit Merah.\nThe team is still applying for permits for the deployment of the sensors, but the target is for the second phase to begin before the end of 2025.\nWith this approach, geothermal exploration in Singapore is done in a non-invasive manner. It also allows for an optimized frequency and scale of deep drilling, thus reducing the overall costs of development.\n**Read more: Singapore, Asia\u2019s newest emerging geothermal market**\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya 28 Oct 2025 Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area 27 Oct 2025 Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines 22 Oct 2025 EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia 20 Oct 2025 Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia 17 Oct 2025 Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation 16 Oct 2025 China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated 16 Oct 2025 Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia 8 Oct 2025 Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia 3 Oct 2025 Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The challenge is to extract lithium selectively from these geothermal waters without disturbing their complex geochemical equilibrium and risking the precipitation of other ingredients such as silicates and calcites. The latter would involve considerable technical risks for the operation of the geothermal plant.\n#### The \u201clithium ion pump\u201d\nAlthough various process approaches for extracting lithium from thermal water are already being developed, no market-ready technology is yet available. \u201cThermIon\u201d aims to develop and demonstrate an environmentally friendly, economically attractive and innovative extraction technology that is initially suitable for lithium.\nThe particular challenge for DLE technologies is to operate them under high temperatures and very high pressures of up to 30 bar over long periods of time. The research team is relying on the \u201clithium ion pump\u201d process, for which the team has carried out initial preliminary tests in the laboratory. Driven by an electric field, this \u201cpump\u201d stores lithium ions in a special lithium manganese oxide electrode and releases them again into a recovery solution when the polarity is reversed. This enables a concentrated lithium chloride solution of high purity to be obtained.\n\u201cI am optimistic that our process will also work on a larger scale and that in the future we will be able to extract lithium directly from the brine during the operation of a geothermal plant. Through this development, we will make a contribution to improving the supply of raw materials in Europe from domestic sources,\n#### A transferable technology\nBecause the thermal water is easily comparable with other locations in the Upper Rhine Graben, the results of the project can be transferred to the 13 planned geothermal projects, which can be developed as pure heat or electricity and heat projects. The process is also fundamentally suitable for the extraction of other valuable materials.\nThe \u201cThermIon\u201d project is funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection (BMWK) with around 2.6 million euros for three years.\nFraunhofer ISE is responsible for project management.

The field is operating at 241.8 steam field capacity with 94 wells in 32 well pads.\nRelating to this project, EDC secured an environmental compliance certificate (ECC) of a 5163-hectare development block back in 2017. The ECC was amended in July 2023 to include a provision for a 30-MW battery energy storage system. Another ECC is currently being processed to reduce the size of the development block to only 4027.59 hectares, which EDC states is enough to the drilling of new wells and construction of supporting infrastructure.\nAccordingly, the project area is proposed to be expanded from 151.5 hectares to 400 hectares to support infrastructure related to the capacity expansion.\nEDC remains very active in the expansion of their installed geothermal power generation capacity, both in the local and international fronts. The company still has at least three binary power plants in development, after the inauguration of the 28.9-MW Palayan Bayan binary plant in the Bacon-Manito field.

Technology\n# The crucial role of community engagement and innovation in geothermal exploration\n!The crucial role of community engagement and innovation in geothermal exploration Feature article - The crucial role of community engagement and innovation in geothermal exploration.\n![ ](\n![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 12 Dec 2024\nA case study in Nyon, Switzerland highlights how innovative technologies can help improve community acceptance of seismic surveys for geothermal exploration.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nIn October 2024, flashing lights and hi-vis-clad workers lit up the streets on the outskirts of Nyon, Switzerland. This team looked like any regular maintenance crew working the streets after dark, but in the center of the buzz was a very different type of work vehicle. Equipped with a moveable vibrating element under the chassis, a \u201cvibroseis\u201d truck was being used to create low-frequency source vibrations for a 3D seismic project to map the subsurface of the area.\nThis was the second of three 3D seismic acquisition campaigns planned across 42 communes around Nyon, Vinzel, and Morges. The project was commissioned via a joint venture between\nDuring the survey, two vibroseis trucks operated simultaneously within the designated quadrangle over several consecutive nights. These trucks generated sound waves that penetrated deep into the subsurface, reflecting off various geological formations. The reflected waves were then captured at ground level by seismic receivers strategically positioned at intervals along the route.\n#### Seismic data acquisition using compact receiver nodes\nFor its 3D seismic acquisition projects,\n![]( comparison of the compact STRYDE node alongside a competitor\u2019s node. (source: STRYDE)\nThese advanced devices enable high-density seismic surveys that deliver rapid access to the high-resolution data needed to make informed decisions, derisking the subsurface geology and leading to optimal geothermal well placement.\nThis high-density survey employed 5,000 seismic receiver points to capture an extensive volume of data, which is now undergoing data processing. Using sophisticated algorithms and software, the raw seismic data acquired by the nodes is being refined and transformed into detailed 3D subsurface models and interpretations. These models provide the most accurate and noninvasive geological insights, delivering critical information in the most effective way possible.\nThe success of producing geothermal energy for heating and electricity projects hinges on locating resources that are both sufficiently hot and productive, underscoring the critical role of seismic data in helping geologists pinpoint these hotspots. Improving knowledge of the subsurface through high-density seismic data acquisition enhances the resolution of subsurface images, increasing the chances of identifying optimal geothermal resources while minimizing geological risks during geothermal well construction.\nAccompanying me in observing the acquisition process in action were Geo2X\u2019s joint CEOs Chlo\u00e9 Nicaty and David Dupuy. They described STRYDE nodes as \u201cfantastic\u201d in that their small size and ability to be almost entirely buried makes them invisible to passers-by and therefore minimizes the chance of theft and data loss. Another highlight of these nodes is that they offer significant cost savings for their clients, not only because their price per channel is significantly lower than competing technologies but also due to reduced labor and logistical requirements.\nThey also observed their ability to accelerate project timelines, enabled by more streamlined deployment and retrieval processes, which require only half the personnel typically needed for managing receivers.\n#### Minimizing disruptions, maximizing coverage\nThe survey area was meticulously planned to ensure maximum coverage while accounting for natural and manmade obstacles. The vibroseis trucks were restricted to existing, surfaced roads, requiring the receivers\u2014ideally placed a few meters from the trucks\u2019 path\u2014to follow these routes. In most cases, nodes were installed on municipal land, but when access to private property was necessary, landowners were contacted directly and asked to grant permission for receiver placement and the passage of the vibroseis team. To ensure transparency, every resident in the survey area received a flyer detailing the project and informing them when to expect the trucks and crews.\nSeveral weeks prior to the acquisition, the receivers were strategically placed along the trace route and programmed to record data exclusively during the designated acquisition period. As fully autonomous devices, these nodes operate independently, requiring no external power or real-time data transfer, minimizing interaction with people and the environment.\nThe preference was always to bury the nodes as this ensures better reception of the seismic waves as well as avoiding damage or loss. Even in the denser urban areas it was usually possible to find enough soil for the nodes to be buried in holes approximately five by ten centimeters deep. When this was not possible, the nodes were attached to a metal spike and baseplate or zip-tied to surrounding infrastructure and hidden as best as possible.\nThe Wi-Fi-free, autonomous design of the STRYDE nodes addresses the public\u2019s privacy and safety concerns, particularly in residential areas. With full autonomy, the nodes are safe, secure, and virtually invisible during operations and are ideal for sensitive environments where public trust and minimal disruption are essential for success.\nAs the crew proceeded on foot down a quiet back street between the lake and the gardens of Prangins Chateau, they entered the private property of stately homes and farm structures. Curious onlookers waved from a window above, and dogs barked from behind a barn as the truck moved steadily along its route, pausing every 20 meters at designated vibration points before continuing to the next.\nEach vibration had a single sweep lasting about 30 seconds, producing a sound comparable to that of a passing vehicle or the distant hum of a construction site. They could be felt underfoot when standing right next to the truck but even a few meters away the vibrations were minimal and cows grazing in a paddock nearby barely lifted their heads.\nWhen the team passed through particularly sensitive areas or close to livestock or property, the vibrations were closely monitored by a portable seismometer to ensure that the amplitude of seismic waves produced by the truck was low enough to avoid damage or disturbance to the surrounding structures or livestock. The seismic vibrations produced by the vibroseis vehicles were well below limits imposed by the Swiss norms, but the precise locations and power of each vibration point were logged for future reference.\nThe surveys were conducted after nightfall, early in the evening, to minimize interference from ambient natural noise and avoid disruptions to local traffic. The trucks traversed the trace lines only once, and the nodes left no visible imprint or damage to the properties, which significantly eased the process of obtaining buy-in and land access approval from landowners.\nOnce the Vibroseis trucks completed their operations and the nodes finished recording, the collection of the receivers began in the historic, downtown area of Nyon. Workers headed out again on foot armed with specially designed, lightweight backpacks that carry up to 90 nodes per person, in neat racks. The exercise was simple and quick, requiring only six days to retrieve 5,000 nodes using five small teams of two to three people, with minimal training.\n![]( seismic crew member deploying STRYDE nodes in an urban setting. (source: STRYDE)\nOnce the nodes were located and de-activated by a custom-designed initialization device and loaded into the trays they were collected by a small vehicle and taken back to the depot for data harvesting and charging.\nOne of the Geo2X crew, Benoit Goudard, explained; \u201cThe GPS location points were accurately recorded by the STRYDE field navigation tablet during their placement so that the nodes can be easily located for rapid retrieval\u201d. This is the second time Benoit has worked with the STRYDE nodal system and with only one day of formal training he was quickly able to head up the retrieval teams and start the data harvesting process.\n#### Getting eyes on the data\nBecause the STRYDE nodal system is fully autonomous, it does not transmit data in real-time; instead, data is stored within each node and retrieved after the acquisition phase. This approach offers several advantages ranging from operational efficiencies where complexity and points of failure are minimized, allowing for more streamlined field operations, to cost-effectiveness where reducing the need for extensive communication networks leads to lower operational costs and resource requirements.\nOnce the nodes come in from the field, the racks holding the ten individual nodes are slotted together to make a tray of 90 nodes and loaded into a charging and data harvesting \u201cnest\u201d which resembles a large suitcase. Up to six of these \u201cnests\u201d work in tandem to charge and harvest 540 nodes within four hours.\n![]( STRYDE charging and data harvesting system. (source: STRYDE)\nThe data is transferred via an optical link and loaded directly onto computers allowing a first look at the raw data from the seismic survey. This streamlined harvesting system, requiring no dismantling of parts, connectors, or separate charging of batteries, allows important gains in time by minimizing handling of the receivers from the moment they arrive from the field to the download of data.\n#### The need for new and better seismic\nThe absence of publicly available modern high-resolution and high-density seismic data in Switzerland has created a competitive and strategic imperative for new high-quality 3D seismic data. Unlike countries like Denmark, where seismic data is centralized and shared to facilitate collaborative planning and minimize duplication of effort, Swiss companies must rely on their own resources to secure the detailed subsurface information needed to accurately assess geothermal potential and mitigate exploration risks.\nThis environment has driven demand for modern, high-resolution data necessary for making informed decisions and maintaining a competitive edge in the fast-growing geothermal market. Recognizing the critical importance of data density and quality in reducing risk and optimizing outcomes, there has been a notable shift toward more widespread adoption of high-density 3D seismic mapping for geothermal exploration in Switzerland.\nUntil recently, 3D seismic mapping for geothermal exploration was both costly and complex, primarily due to the bulky and outdated receiver equipment traditionally used to record seismic data. This often restricted companies to conducting smaller scale 2D surveys or relying on legacy data, both of which lacked the detail necessary for making well-informed decisions. Technological advancements, such as the introduction of STRYDE\u2019s small, autonomous nodes, have significantly reduced the costs of high-density 3D surveys, making them feasible and efficient, even in densely populated urban areas like Nyon.\nThe vast amount of data collected during the survey will be utilized by Energe\u00d4 throughout the geothermal exploration process and will eventually be made publicly available for research, fostering further advancements in geothermal energy development.\n#### Applying a proven blueprint to help companies unlock geothermal potential\nBack in the Geo2X office, the planning and permitting team was already working on another upcoming project around the city of Lausanne. This preliminary phase is an important and complex part of any seismic acquisition project and will often take anything from six months to a year to complete.\nStreamlining the permitting and planning phase ensures the success of the overall project and helps the acquisition phase run as smoothly as possible. To start this process off, Geo2X creates maps of the survey area and breaks them down into grids, representing the parcels of land and their status concerning access permission, obstacles, etc. The number of parcels to consider can reach in the tens of thousands and the acquisition route can be adjusted dynamically depending on access to land parcels and roads.\nRecognizing the complexity and critical importance of this phase for seamless project execution and ensuring data acquisition without gaps, Geo2X has assembled a dedicated team of four to five specialists. This team works closely with private landholders, facilitating direct communication while efficiently managing the extensive information required for planning and permitting processes.\nImpressively, Geo2X has also created a purpose-built software application with interactive maps where stakeholders can access up-to-date information on the status of parcels access, the progress of the acquisition, the data harvesting results, etc. The public is also given access to parts of the application via a QR code on the flyer and can follow, in real-time, the progress of the survey, giving local people insight into when the seismic crew and vehicles will be in their area.\nProviding local residents with access to real-time survey information about activities in their areas is crucial for fostering transparency, keeping the community informed, and minimizing potential conflicts. This proactive approach has enabled Geo2X to build trust and help ensure residents can prepare for any disruptions, resulting in the delivery of seamless seismic surveys for their clients.\n![]( bespoke software available for local stakeholders to access up-to-date information on the status of the seismic project. (source: STRYDE)\nThe use of small, non-intrusive receivers has been pivotal in the permitting and operational phases of the survey. With a robust and well-defined approach to surveying and a large inventory of nodes, that sit neatly and discreetly in a corner of their facility, Geo2X has cemented its position as a leading seismic contractor in this rapidly growing region, where the demand for high-quality 3D seismic data continues to rise.\nGeo2X\u2019s upcoming 3D seismic acquisition campaigns around Morges and Lausanne in 2025 will showcase the critical importance of their expertly executed, efficient, and cost-effective seismic solutions. By setting a benchmark for successful geothermal exploration, Geo2X is not only advancing sustainable energy development in Switzerland but also paving the way for similar initiatives across Europe, propelling the green energy transition to new heights.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Technology\n# New demonstration project starts for super-hot rock EGS in Newberry, Oregon\n!New demonstration project starts for super-hot rock EGS in Newberry, Oregon Mazama Energy company logo\n![ ](\n![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 15 Oct 2024\nMazama Energy has announced the start of a demonstration project for superhot rock enhanced geothermal systems in the Newberry site in Oregon.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n\u201cSuper-Hot Rock\u201d in this context refers to rocks that have a temperature of 375 \u00b0C or greater and when extracted can provide several times the power density than lower temperature rock. The heat recovery needs to be engineered by EGS because the rocks are naturally impermeable. The goal for the demonstration project is to show for the first time that a commercially viable geothermal reservoir can be created in super-hot rocks.\n#: Harnessing heat from SuperHot rock: The Mazama Energy approach\n\u201cGeothermal energy has the smallest environmental footprint of any renewable power source we now have and can provide 24\/7 baseload power without any emission of CO2\n\u201cThe purpose of the Newberry SHR Demonstration project is to show that the new technology developed by Mazama Energy will enable the economic extraction of heat from the earth in locations where it was considered not possible so far. This demonstration project will benefit from an important support of the U.S. Department of Energy and conducted in close collaboration with Oregon State University and several national research institutions,\u201d\nEnhanced Geothermal Systems are geothermal reservoirs created in hot, low permeability rock by injecting cold water to create permeability in solid rock. This means an EGS can be sited in areas without naturally occurring hydrothermal resources with surface manifestations such as hot springs and fumaroles. As such, an EGS could theoretically be sited anywhere there is geothermal heat that is economically recoverable.\nUntil now, a major challenge facing EGS projects has been the cost. Since geothermal wells can cost several million dollars to construct, increasing the generation capacity of each well is critically important for making it more competitive on the open market for electricity. Systems with single stimulated zones simply don\u2019t yield enough power per well to make the electricity produced cost competitive. Having the ability to create multiple stimulated zones from a single well increases the amount of power produced by the well, and thus decreases the overall cost of the power produced.\nThe Newberry project of Mazama Energy was one of three projects to receive funding from the US Department of Energy during the first funding round for EGS projects, as announced early 2024. A second funding round has since been announced that seeks to support proposed EGS projects in the eastern United States.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![SLB and Ormat partner to fast-track development of integrated geothermal assets 27 Oct 2025 SLB and Ormat partner to fast-track development of integrated geothermal assets ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development 27 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![BLM Nevada geothermal lease sale nets over USD 9 million in bids on 86 parcels 23 Oct 2025 BLM Nevada geothermal lease sale nets over USD 9 million in bids on 86 parcels ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program 22 Oct 2025 Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards 17 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program 15 Oct 2025 California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University 2 Oct 2025 PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Turboden to deliver ORC systems for Phase II of Cape Station geothermal project in Utah 2 Oct 2025 Turboden to deliver ORC systems for Phase II of Cape Station geothermal project in Utah ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![XGS Energy completes 3000-hour operations of geothermal technology in Coso, California 30 Sep 2025 XGS Energy completes 3000-hour operations of geothermal technology in Coso, California ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells 25 Sep 2025 Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Quaise holds public demonstration of millimeter wave technology for geothermal drilling 22 Sep 2025 Quaise holds public demonstration of millimeter wave technology for geothermal drilling ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

    "Indicator":"Mazama Energy has initiated a demonstration project in Newberry, Oregon, to develop super-hot rock enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) that can harness thermal energy from rocks at temperatures of 375\u00b0C or higher. The project aims to prove that commercially viable geothermal reservoirs can be created in such extreme conditions, potentially enabling geothermal energy production in locations previously considered unsuitable. Supported by the U.S. Department of Energy and in collaboration with Oregon State University and other research institutions, this initiative seeks to address key cost challenges and demonstrate the feasibility of multi-zone stimulation from a single well to increase power output. Successful development could significantly expand the geographic and economic scope of geothermal energy.",

This follows up on the original plans announced by local utility\nThe seismic measurement campaign will involve nine special vibration vehicles that will transmit vibrations into the subsurface, which will then be reflected and detected in the surface by 12,000 measuring devices or geo-phones. The same exploration method to has been used to great success in several cities in Germany, as well as in Switzerland, France, the Netherlands, and Denmark.\nThe aim of the study is to analyze the nature of the rock layers in order to identify a potential reservoir for the use of deep geothermal energy. The database obtained can be used to create precise 3D models of the subsurface, which can later be used to plan drilling.\nThe main measurement area will cover 136 square kilometers in the city of Erfurt, including surrounding communities such as Udestedt, Gro\u00dfrudestedt, and Riethnordhausen. All affected property owners and residents will be informed at an early stage.

Technology\n# Vulcan to supply BASF chemical production facility in Germany with geothermal heat\n!Vulcan to supply BASF chemical production facility in Germany with geothermal heat The Ludwigshafen facility of chemical manufacturer BASF (source: BASF)\n![ ](\n![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 24 Nov 2024\nVulcan Energy has entered into an agreement to supply geothermal heat for industrial use of chemical producer BASF in Germany, with possible lithium extraction.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nThis announcement follows up on two similarly big announcements that Vulcan has made within the last two weeks \u2013 the start of lithium hydroxide production at the company\u2019s CLEOP site in Frankfurt, and the awarding of EUR 100 million federal funding from the Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection of Germany.\nBeyond reducing the CO2 emissions of BASF\u2019s Ludwigshafen site, the geothermal opportunity extends to the potential for district heating to supply households in nearby cities. Vulcan and BASF are collaborating with regional energy providers\nThe two partners plant to evaluate the possible construction and operation of a Lithium Extraction Plant on the BASF premises to produce lithium salts concentrate following energy production from the hot brine. This will then be transported to Vulcan\u2019s Central Lithium Plant to produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide for the European electric vehicle market.\nApproximately 2000\u20132500 GWh\/a of heat generation is targeted from the Ludwigsland Development Project (LDP) from an integrated renewable heat and lithium brine operation, representing a significant amount of the heat demand of BASF. Ludwigshafen is BASF\u2019s global headquarters. With a workforce of around 34,000 people, it serves as a key economic and industrial hub within the Upper Rhine Valley and is a significant contributor to the region\u2019s growth and development.\nVulcan seeks to replicate this model across the Upper Rhine Valley. The company aims to build geothermal heating facilities to decarbonize industrial facilities and the public heating sector, while also utilizing the geothermal brine to produce lithium chloride.\n\u201cPartnering with Germany\u2019s largest chemical company, BASF, to provide renewable geothermal heat at their Ludwigshafen headquarters is an excellent demonstration of Vulcan Energy\u2019s dual commitment to decarbonise energy and lithium production via our integrated business approach,\u201d\n\u201cThis collaboration highlights how geothermal renewable energy and carbon neutral lithium production can work harmoniously together, delivering mutual benefits for industry and communities.\u201d\n\u201cWe want to supply our Ludwigshafen site with C-free steam in the future. In addition to harnessing the waste heat from our production facilities, where possible, we want to consider renewable heat sources from geothermal structures,\u201d\n#### The terms of the agreement\nBASF will jointly fund the geothermal exploration as the first phase of the project. Assuming the first phases of the project, including seismic campaigns, exploratory well and doublet drilling are successful, and the partners decide to proceed with the project, BASF will be the heat offtaker for 100% of the geothermal heat\nThere will be three stages to the project:\n1. 2D seismic campaigns in the 2024\/2025 winter season and a follow-up 3D seismic survey in 2025\/2026 winter season to determine the well site locations. The costs of the 2D and 3D seismic surveys are to be borne evenly by the project partners.\n2. Subject to successful seismic campaigns, identification of suitable drilling targets and public funding being obtained, the parties intend to drill, log and test one well with further details to be agreed within a co-operation agreement.\n3. Subject to the first well producing sufficient quantities of hot brine, lithium and geothermal energy, the parties will decide whether to drill an estimated 12 new production and 12 re-injection wells on an estimated 5 new well sites. Each well cluster would contain a heat transfer station connected to Vulcan\u2019s Lithium Extraction Plant on BASF premises within the Ludwigshafen complex and BASF heating station via a new pipeline system, with BASF to act as facilitator.\nSource: Email correspondence\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

She then pursued an MBA from the Harvard Business School, which led to her developing an interest in renewable energy, and eventually to the field of geothermal energy.\n#### A pivot to geothermal\nTerra\u2019s technical background and experience, paired with an interest in energy solutions, eventually led her to explore renewable energy sources. As her career evolved, she recognized the potential of geothermal energy as an underutilized yet incredibly potent source of clean and consistent power. This realization sparked her pivot into geothermal, where she believed her skills in engineering, data analysis, and communication could make a significant impact.\nToday, as the Program Director for Superhot Rock (SHR) Energy at the Clean Air Task Force (CATF), Rogers is pioneering efforts to harness the potential of this technology. SHR geothermal taps into the subsurface temperatures exceeding 400\u00b0C, which provides higher energy density for power generation and may make geothermal projects feasible on a global scale.\nFor Rogers, this technology represents a key opportunity to reshape the future of clean energy, offering a more scalable and reliable solution compared to existing renewable options.\n![]( presenting the findings from the CATF research into the public perceptions of Geothermal Energy in advance of the 2023 Geothermal Rising Conference. (source: WinG)\n#### The importance of information\nRogers recognizes that there is a significant gap in public understanding and awareness of geothermal energy, particularly SHR. She also believes that a geothermal policy backed by unbiased reporting is key to enabling the development of projects both locally and internationally. In an industry that hopes to get more interest from venture capital, sharing information publicly can attract investors but may also jeopardize intellectual property. Therefore, a regulated ecosystem for data sharing is essential.\nTo tackle this challenge, Rogers has focused on advocacy and education. She understands the importance of sharing accurate, compelling information with diverse stakeholders\u2014from government officials who can shape policy to industry leaders who can drive innovation. Terra and the SHR team at CATF are preparing five technology gap reports that aim to describe the limiting factors for SHR, hoping to help inform policy decisions to foster a more transparent and secure environment for innovation and project development.\nRecently, Rogers testified on behalf of H.R. 8665 the Supercritical Geothermal Research and Development Act, to the US House of Representatives \u2013 which, according to Rogers, was a \u201csignificant step toward recognizing the unparalleled potential of the next generations of geothermal energy in the US energy portfolio\u201d.\n![]( Rogers testifying before the House of Natural Resources on H.R. 8665 \u2013 The Supercritical Geothermal Research and Development Act (source: video screenshot \/ House Committee of Natural Resources)\n#### Don\u2019t think small\nTo someone trying to start in the geothermal industry, Terra advises not to think small. This underscores her belief in the massive potential of geothermal to disrupt the global energy market. It is this belief that fuels her passion to drive the activation of funding for geothermal projects, recognizing that costs can reduced if there is a wider recognition of the terawatt-scale potential of geothermal.\nRogers continues to advocate for a venture-backed first-of-its-kind geothermal project that shows the energy density of a SHR system. She believes that international collaboration and knowledge sharing are crucial, recognizing similar advancements in EGS would not have been possible without collaboration.\nTerra\u2019s vision is for the geothermal industry to leverage these cross-industry innovations and international collaborations to realize its full potential. By doing so, geothermal energy can become a major player in the global energy market, providing a sustainable, energy-dense power source.\n#### Past Women in Geothermal highlights:\n* Robin Zuza, Ormat Technologies\n* Brittany Gierke, Fervo Energy\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards 23 Oct 2025 Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Arup 13 Oct 2025 Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Aru ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress 10 Oct 2025 Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya 6 Oct 2025 Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa 2 Oct 2025 The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels 24 Sep 2025 Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France 18 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! 17 Sep 2025 One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest 15 Sep 2025 Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees 12 Sep 2025 Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Technology\n# Geomechanics: The Backbone of Geothermal Energy\n!Geomechanics: The Backbone of Geothermal Energy \"Geomechanics: The backbone of geothermal energy\" - a guest article by TEVERRA\n![ ](\n![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 28 Jan 2025\nThe study of geomechanics plays a crucial yet underappreciated role in geothermal energy, from wellbore stability to effectivity of hydraulic stimulation.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nGeomechanics, the study of the mechanical behavior of rocks and soils, plays a crucial role in developing and operating geothermal energy systems, particularly in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) and Superhot Rock (SHR) projects. By understanding the stress state, rock strength, and fluid flow behavior in the subsurface, geomechanics helps to optimize well design, hydraulic fracturing, and reservoir management (Liu et al., 2022).\nWhile this is conceptually understood, there is still some confusion of just how valuable and extensive geomechanics studies can be within the geothermal industry. In the worst case scenario, no geomechanical model or an incorrect model could lead to improper wellbore treatment and wellbore loss, in the best case scenario, a proper geomechanical model can lead to a successful, optimized, profitable geothermal power plant.\nThis guest article written by\n#### Wellbore Stability\nWellbore stability is vital in successfully developing and operating geothermal energy projects, particularly in high-temperature and high-pressure environments. Extreme temperatures, high fluid pressures, and thermal stresses can significantly impact wellbore integrity.\nGeomechanical analysis is essential to predict and mitigate potential stability issues, including borehole collapse, borehole enlargement, and lost circulation, to ensure the long-term viability of geothermal wells. By optimizing drilling fluid design, casing, cementation programs, and wellbore completion strategies, engineers can enhance wellbore stability and maximize geothermal energy\u2019s economic and environmental benefits (Madyarov et al., 2021).\n![]( of wellbore stability simulation model results: maximum principal stress (left) and minimum principal stress (right) distributions around the wellbore with hydrostatic pressure in the wellbore. (Madyarov et al., 2021)\nThe figure above shows an example of wellbore stability simulation model results: maximum principal stress (left) and minimum principal stress (right) distributions around the wellbore with hydrostatic pressure in the wellbore.\n#### Hydraulic Fracturing\nHydraulic fracturing, a well-established technique in the oil and gas industry, has been adapted for use in the geothermal industry to enhance reservoir permeability and improve energy extraction. By injecting high-pressure fluid into the subsurface formation, hydraulic fracturing creates complex fracture networks that facilitate the flow of geothermal fluids to the production well and efficient heat extraction from the reservoir.\nHowever, the 20 years of hydraulic fracturing experience in the oil and gas industry shows that not all hydraulic fracturing designs are successful. Geomechanical modeling is crucial in optimizing hydraulic fracturing operations by predicting fracture propagation, minimizing induced seismicity, and maximizing reservoir productivity. Careful consideration of factors such as rock properties, in-situ stress state, and fluid injection parameters is essential to ensure the success of hydraulic fracturing treatments in geothermal reservoirs (Porlles & Jabbari, 2022).\n#### Superhot Rock (SHR) Geothermal Systems\nSuperhot Rock (SHR) geothermal systems offer a promising avenue for harnessing vast amounts of geothermal energy from deep, high-temperature rock formations (Houde et al., 2021). These systems involve drilling deep wells into the Earth\u2019s crust to access hot rock, fractured to create a reservoir. Water is injected into the fractures to extract heat, which is then used to generate electricity.\nWhile there is significant opportunity, the extreme temperature and pressure conditions associated with SHR systems pose significant technical challenges, including wellbore stability, induced seismicity, and corrosion. Advanced drilling technologies, hydraulic fracturing techniques, and robust wellbore design are essential to overcome these challenges, many of which cannot be tested until SHR drilling commences.\nBy understanding the geomechanical properties of the rock formations and simulating drilling and wellbore completion in SHR conditions, the industry can progress towards optimizing the design and operation of SHR systems. Once successful, SHR will unlock the enormous potential of this clean and sustainable energy source (Cladouhos & Callahan, 2024).\n![]( numerical model (geometry and mesh) performed to test wellbore stability of a hypothetical superhot rock wellbore ((Madyarov et al., 2021)\nThe figure above shows a geomechanical numerical model (geometry and mesh) performed to test wellbore stability of a hypothetical superhot rock wellbore.\n#### Proppant Selection\nProppant selection in the geothermal industry involves choosing solid, granular materials pumped into hydraulic fractures to maintain their permeability and enhance fluid flow.\nUnlike conventional oil and gas applications, geothermal reservoirs often experience higher temperatures and pressures and exposure to corrosive fluids. These operating conditions are incompatible with many oil and gas industry proppants; therefore, proppants must be carefully selected to withstand these harsh conditions and maintain their integrity over time.\nKey factors to consider in proppant selection include proppant lab analysis using geomechanics crushing test, particle size distribution, strength, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and cost-effectiveness. By optimizing proppant selection and placement, engineers can improve the performance of geothermal reservoirs and maximize energy extraction (Liu et al., 2023).\n#### Thermal Stress Analysis\nThermal stress analysis in the geothermal industry involves evaluating the impact of temperature gradients on the mechanical behavior of rock formations and wellbore components. High-temperature differences between the hot reservoir rock and the cooler drilling fluid or injected water can induce significant thermal stresses, leading to potential issues such as wellbore instability, rock fracture, and reduced reservoir productivity.\nGeomechanical modeling techniques, including finite element analysis (FEA), simulate thermal stress distribution and assess its impact on wellbore integrity and reservoir performance. By understanding the thermal stress regime, engineers can optimize well design, casing selection, and production strategies to mitigate the risks associated with thermal expansion and contraction (Zhou et al., 2022).

The utility has so far already completed work on a new 5-kilometer stretch of district heating pipeline. Part of the project is the drilling of a new doublet to a depth of around 4000 meters. This is expected to start by the spring of 2025.\nConstruction of above-ground facility will then proceed by 2026, looking towards a start of supply to the district heating network by the 2027\/2028 heating season. Once Laufzorn II is in operation, Gr\u00fcnwald will achieve maximum independence in terms of heat supply and independence from fossil fuels.\nThe project is set to receive EUR 62.3 million of funding from the Federal Ministry of Economics. The municipality will also be investing an additional ~EUR 150 million.\n\u201cI would like to thank our partners who have supported us so successfully so far and who will accompany us in the next important steps. I would especially like to thank Erdwerk, the geology planning office, Anger, which will carry out the deep drilling, Pfaffinger, which is responsible for building the drilling site, and last but not least the planning team from Drees & Sommer,\u201d\n\u201cTogether we are expanding what is already the largest geothermal district heating network in Central Europe and creating value for the future.

This has allowed the company to better streamline their operations, allowing for more regular inspection while reducing workload and improving workplace safety.\nEDC had recently augmented the generation capacity of the BacMan geothermal field with a new 28.9-MW binary power plant.\n#### Faster and safer inspection\nWith about 40 kilometers of pipeline being utilized to support the 209 MW of installed geothermal power generation capacity at the BacMan site, manual inspection using handheld thermal cameras takes plenty of time and is very resource-intensive. It also exposes personnel to hazards like high elevations, steep terrain, and having to be in proximity of very hot (up to 170 \u00b0C) steam lines.\nHowever, pipeline inspection is critical for maintaining the optimal operations of the geothermal facility. Pipelines can corrode, leading to degradation of the insulation, heat loss, and leaks. These leaks can reduce power output. At worst, leaks can aggravate and result in pipe explosions. Through thorough and consistent inspection, such risks can be mitigated early.\nThe use of a drone for inspection has allowed EDC to optimize their operations and streamline their workflows. The drone can operated remotely, is housed in a weatherproof dock, and can fly autonomously based on pre-set waypoints. Inspection of all 40 kilometers of pipeline, which will take years if done manually, can now be done in just days.\nCheck out the video below to learn more about how EDC is leveraging advanced drone technology to improve geothermal operations at the BacMan site in the Philippines.\n?\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya 28 Oct 2025 Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area 27 Oct 2025 Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines 22 Oct 2025 EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia 20 Oct 2025 Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia 17 Oct 2025 Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation 16 Oct 2025 China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated 16 Oct 2025 Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia 8 Oct 2025 Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia 3 Oct 2025 Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

With a current heat demand of 1,365 GWh for the whole greater Graz area, with 1,160 GWh for the city itself it is expected that demand will grow to 1,400 GWh for 2030 and up to 1,500 GWh for 2040.\nInteresting are then the concrete plans with the project \u201cTiefengeothermie fuer Graz\u201d. (deep geothermal for Graz).\nThe project targets the drilling of four doublets to a depth of 3,000 to 4,000 meters, as well as the 2 aquifer thermal energy storage reservoirs at doublette 3 and 4 at a depth of 700 to 800m.\nThe geothermal project is the most important single project for the decarbonisation plan of 2024 and would be crucial in reaching the 80% criteria for highly efficient heat.\nA Pre-feasibility study was contracted in 2021 and has been an important first step.\nFor the project, Energie Graz Gmbh is now in negotiations on the following contracts:\n* Framework contract with the joint venture of\n* Heat Supply contract with the JV (OMV & Energie Steiermark)\n* Power supply contract with the JV, and\n* Contract for the offtake infrastructure with Energie Steiermark Waerme GmbH\nFor Energie Graz it is reported, that no significant investments are expected, the refinancing for the joint venture company will take place through the agreed price for the heat delivery to Energie Graz GmbH. OMV, together with Energie Wien is currently developing a geothermal project in Vienna, Austria and is also pushing geothermal development for heat in Germany.\nPrice discounts from the basis price are set up in the contract in the case of improved economics in the project development. These are envisioned if there is less demand for directional drilling or no superchrome 13 casing might be needed. Subsidies over EUR 6 million per doublette would also reduce the agreed on price. Price increases are excluded. With project success of a heat deliver of 500 GWh, for additional heat supply up to 625 GWh no remuneration is to be paid. For heat delivered beyond that there will be a large discount from the basis price.\nTarget of the first heat deliver from first doublette is 2030 with an (indicated) heat contract term of 40 years.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

    "Indicator":"The city of Graz, Austria, has approved a decarbonization plan that involves developing a 140 MWth geothermal heat project, jointly undertaken by OMV Green Energy and Energie Steiermark. The project aims to significantly reduce reliance on fossil fuels for district heating, with plans to drill four deep doublets at 3,000-4,000 meters and establish aquifer thermal storage. This initiative is central to Graz's goal of achieving 80% highly efficient heat, with first heat delivery targeted for 2030 and a 40-year contract horizon. The project represents a strategic move towards renewable geothermal energy for urban heating and aligns with broader European geothermal development efforts.",

Landsvirkjun's geothermal power plant at Krafla, Iceland (source: flickr\/ thinkgeoenergy, creative commons)\n![ ](\n![ ]( Dave Waters 5 Feb 2025\nDespite its proven potential, geothermal energy struggles to scale. Regulatory hurdles, financing challenges, and industry awareness must align to drive growth.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nThe following is a guest post published by\n#### What\u2019s the hold-up?\nA question which has long interested many geoscientists, is why is geothermal taking so long to gain traction at a larger scale than what it has to date achieved.\nWhen I look at this question, I am not on some personal crusade to make geothermal huge. I am not sure that is where it will end up and do not presume so. I am however interested in where it can genuinely fit into the energy toolbox. One tool amongst many in the repertoire. I do think it does have potential to increase significantly from where it is. On inspection it is possible to recognise that as a vague statement, and I can only say that is deliberately so. A lot of variables are in play.\nMost particularly, I am interested in why existing proven tried and tested technologies are not more widely adopted. The merits of new immature or developing technologies is a question well worth investigation but one I\u2019m going to park \u2013 not because it isn\u2019t worthwhile to ask, but because of the time element involved.\nIf something is a new technology, it takes longer to prove up in a way that is \u201cready to roll\u201d and relevant for a project that an investor wants to take forward quickly, now. There are more risks involved, be they technical or commercial in nature, or both. An R&D development pilot project is something that requires a whole different and rarer type of investor, and that is a story for another day. A lot of exciting stuff is happening and great, but meanwhile there is an important \u201cyet\u2026\u201d.\nOf the things we see widely deployed already, some of which have been shown to work for over a century, why is not take-up larger? This is a question I feel genuinely motivated to help with, and not because I have some financial involvement in a specifically geothermal company, I don\u2019t. I wish to help those places which have underutilised resource, to put it to better use. I fully believe there are quite a few of those, without it necessarily \u201cchanging the world\u201d. It doesn\u2019t have to do that to still be happily useful to a lot of players.\n#### Lots of moving parts\nMy perception (and there are contrasting ones available!) is simply that geothermal is something that has a lot of moving parts that all need to synchronise sufficiently for decent progress to be made in any one place. Before discussing that though, it is probably worth stressing that there is also lack of awareness of how much there is happening already.\nIf \u2013 as mentioned above \u2013 we focus on the \u201cconventional\u201d already widely adopted technologies, there are three broad categories of geothermal use:\n1. Geothermal with heat pumps\n2. Geothermal direct use heat\n3. Geothermal power\nWhere geothermal is hot enough to deliver power, there can sometimes be option to combine the above.\nIn terms of energy delivery today, each of these roughly speaking, split about 1\/3 each \u2013 though it is worth stressing that power is a different product to heat. To compare them in energy terms is a bit like comparing apples with pears. But just as a loose approximation, it\u2019s not too far-off to say 1\/3 geothermal heat pumps, 1\/3 direct use heat, and 1\/3 power.\n![]( of the Tauhara geothermal power plant in New Zealand, May 2023 (source: Video screenshot, Contact Energy)\nSo while it is the geothermal power that so often occupies public and general awareness, and which does typically have some geographical limitations on where conventional technologies can be practically applied \u2013 it is the much more widely geographical available uses for heat that provide roughly 2\/3 of the utilised geothermal energy. In terms of the actual number of projects and drilling \u2013 they are vastly more than that, because power projects are typically bigger and so their contribution is supplied by fewer projects. Something of the order of a few hundred wells per year, in contrast to the many thousands that supply the heat.\nNow I have used the term geothermal heat pumps, and there is a nuance of a distinction to be had technically, in distinguishing purely \u201cground sourced\u201d heat pumps that utilise mainly solar energy diffused into the top 20m of the ground, and \u201cgeothermal\u201d heat pumps that go deeper than that, which utilise truly geothermal heat, in a strict sense. For the sake of simplicity, I\u2019m not going to worry about that distinction. The reality is that the statistics available rarely differentiate it anyway, so any desire to distinguish is stymied even if we wanted to.\nSuffice to say that what heat pumps do, is enable us to \u201ccondense\u201d heat from lower temperatures, to elevate those temperatures \u2013 but they need a bit of power to do so, and some spend to put them in place. Direct use heat by contrast, works with the temperatures that nature gives us and deploys them directly, as the name suggests.\n#### Who are the customers?\nSo it is always the first question to understand isn\u2019t it \u2013 who wants to use what is available? And scaling something up is possible to achieve through many routes, lots of small, or few very big, middling amounts of medium, or of course, a mixture of all the above. Without going into laborious detail, the key customers for geothermal energy fall into a number of different categories:\n* Medium to big customers that want heat \u2013 for industry, or district heating, or horticulture & agriculture.\n* Small residential and commercial customers that want heat, typically but not only for space or water heating. Noting that cunning use of evaporative cooling methods can also use heat to make cool these days, and that cool can be a useful by-product of heat pump provided heat.\n* Big customers that want power, either for a big industrial\/commercial facility, or for distribution into a grid.\nAlthough there is a developing market at suitable locations for brine minerals available in geothermal fluids such as silica or lithium, I will for the moment put that in the newer, rather than conventional category. There are no doubt examples that deviate from the three characterisations above, but they dominate a large part of geothermal use today.\n#### What\u2019s the hit list of requirements for a \u201cconventional\u201d geothermal \u201cthunderbirds are go?\u201d\nSo, armed with these very basic introductions to the nature of the existing technology geothermal market, what is the list of \u201cmoving parts\u201d that need to be in place for it to gather momentum?\n1. A compilation of existing case studies that can provide assurance in detail to customers that what they are contemplating doing is not so very wild after all. Sometimes in places where deployment is newer and unusual, that might involve resort to case studies from other places that are most similar, in the contexts of most interest and\/or concern to the customer.\n2. A regulatory environment that is comfortable with geothermal resource and clear on ownership and other legal issues.\n3. Geoscientific, drilling and facility engineering expertise that is readily available not just to install but to help maintain projects operationally for their full life. Expertise that has history of working on geothermal projects of the type proposed. In places where such deployment is newer, that might involve the complementary assistance of internationally operating experts for some aspects \u2013 until such time as local expertise can be trained and readily, steadily available.\n4. Clarity on the nature and likelihood of risks involved where they are indeed present, and an array of recognised mitigation strategies that will vary in nature with the type of customer and resource. It might involve insurance, or state assistance, or shared risks in multiple projects, or for the right kind of investor simply assurance from available relevant case studies that the risk is small.\n5. A regional working database that is fit for purpose for a good start, to enable any new project to \u201chit the ground running\u201d. If every project has to start with a new and time consuming regional & local resource evaluation stage, it is a sure killer for those who want to move quickly. There needs to be some sense of a pre-existing \u201con the shelf\u201d national database that can effectively be put to use quickly, with some local embellishment, to facilitate speed against competing options. There are some misconceptions about what an effective database looks like, and we will talk to that separately. Such a database will typically have some free front-end and some pay-for deeper level, but the pre-requisite is that the data available is adequate to help kick-start real projects. The existence of such a database requires a pre-emptive investment in its creation from some larger player \u2013 typically state \u2013 appreciative of the longer-term reward involved in doing so.\n6. An awareness of the customers \u2013 big and small \u2013 in broad terms \u2013 of the existence of the option. This includes awareness within the specific industries or other big commercial and state players \u2013 of the geothermal options that most typically characterise existing usages. Also awareness of where to find relevant expertise for first \u201cscoping\u201d evaluation in their local area, as all the options competing with geothermal are first considered. Such awareness should ideally also include ways that geothermal can be integrated with other resources as a great bonus without necessarily having to be the \u201cwhole answer\u201d.\n7. A financier and insurance community that equally has some awareness of the topic, as per point 6. That includes an awareness of the differences in cashflow timing with other types of energy investment.\n![]( meeting in Laudat held by the Dominica Geothermal Development Company (source: DGDC)\nSo seven things. It might not seem at first glance that many to assemble. In practice though each one of these is far from trivial. Many, many places have a subset of that seven maturing well, but the number of places that have them all \u201cwell-oiled\u201d for every aspect are few.\nParticularly for all of the three broad applications \u2013 geothermal heat pumps, geothermal direct use heat, and geothermal power. Some might be going \u201cgreat guns\u201d on one of these, without really having fully embraced the other two. It is in the recognition of opportunity from all three, on all seven of these levels that geothermal truly reaches its full potential against competing options \u2013 whatever that final \u201cposition\u201d might be.\nIt has been my experience that many institutions and teams are in fact addressing many aspects of each of these items diligently, proficiently, and expertly in many places. But simply put, until all the items on the list are assembled and pulling together, the inertia to overcome for new projects is large.\n#### The database to assemble\nI don\u2019t want this to be an unduly technical article, so it is not the intention to go into a lot of detail here on the finer aspects of conventional geothermal projects. Three things I would like to stress though, include:\n* The differentiation of static data from dynamic data, and inclusion of the latter.\n* The importance of customer research.\n* The importance of competing-option research.\nStatic vs dynamic data\nWhat do I mean by static and dynamic? Well I need to frame that first. There are a lot of ongoing discussions about newer deep geothermal applications which don\u2019t depend on the utilisation of hot water or steam naturally present in the ground. Many of the conventional shallower geothermal heat pump applications equally don\u2019t require use of this \u201cnatural\u201d \u201cin-the ground\u201d water, and for them the static data works well. But there are many that do rely on it and which need more.\nConventional deep geothermal applications often depend on using the hot water which is present naturally in the ground, and circulating it within the ground, and to the surface, and back again, after it has cooled. Ultimately we extract heat in these deeper (let\u2019s for now say > 400m) conventional geothermal applications by cooling rock which has intrinsic permeability. That cooling is to some extent replaced by the earth\u2019s natural heat flow, at a rate specific to a location and its geological character.\nThe heat we can get from a deep geothermal well in these situations is not just a function of temperature, it depends just as much on physically how much water we can extract from the underground reservoir. Unless we want geothermal power, which does have some practical temperature thresholds for commercial application, heat pumps empower us to utilise lower temperatures, if we have enough water coming from underground. They \u201ccondense\u201d \u2013 in a loose sense \u2013 that lower temperature heat from big volumes into higher temperature heat.\nIt\u2019s no good in these situations to have high temperature and no permeability. What we get might be hot, but we might not have enough of it. Now other technologies in development for deep geothermal are looking to see just how commercial some \u201cworkarounds\u201d to that can be, but as said earlier, that\u2019s a whole other story and I\u2019m parking those for now. Why? Parked as not being readily accessible to those who have a project they want to move with quickly tomorrow, on timescales competitive against the other options customers have.\nWhat all this means, is that for many of these conventional geothermal projects, what we want to know, is how water is naturally moving around in the subsurface, and how quickly it can be extracted from it. Not only that, but the perturbations to the system that exploiting it creates. That involves appreciating the forces controlling fluid flow in a basin, including hinterland rainfall, detailed rock structure, tectonic stresses, and it involves understanding how much any given well can produce. It is the data surrounding how things move, and how temperatures and pressures and volumes and chemistries change as function of each other, and as a function of time.\nThis kind of data is very empowering where it exists. It helps reveal how projects that rely commercially on how much hot water of a certain temperature is produced with time, can sustainably be flowed over a project lifetime.\n![]( of the production and injection wells at the Utah FORGE site (source: Screenshot from Utah FORGE virtual tour)\nThis \u201cdynamic\u201d data is very different from \u201cstatic\u201d data. It is for a start much less widely shared. Precisely because it is much more useful, it is often deemed much more confidential by data owners. It is also genuinely trickier to handle. If you can imagine hundreds or even thousands of wells, all flowing with different temperatures, chemistries, pressures, and flow rate volumes, over some decades of well life, well instantly you get an appreciation of the amount of data that can be implied.\nSometimes though there is simply not the realisation present by the licensing and regulating bodies that they should be obliging organisations to release this data after some agreed, regulated time frame. This kind of data is immensely valuable to new project feasibility studies. That is not a call for authorities to get draconian in the data they require to be collected, as that can sometimes kill interest. Simply that what data is collected is ultimately shared on some agreed, regulated timeframe.\nSo what is the contrasting \u201cstatic\u201d data. Well it is things like the inferred temperatures at depth, at the time of first drilling. The type of rock, the porosity and permeability it has, the faults and fractures and geometries. The geochemistry of the water. The thermal conductivity of those rocks, and so on. This can tell us how much heat is \u201cembedded\u201d in the rock and fluid at depth. Data surrounding things that don\u2019t move, and don\u2019t change [so much] with time.\nHowever it is the dynamic data that really tells us how much we can get to surface to use over a project lifetime, and what the impacts will be on any geochemical character. Yet commonly, vast efforts are undertaken to provide extensive static data sets in the belief that this alone empowers geothermal project activation. It doesn\u2019t on its own. It is a necessary pre-requisite, but it is not on its own a sufficient condition. To truly take conventional deep geothermal to new levels requires an understanding of dynamic data in a region, or if genuinely in a new area, comparable analogues. That requires a concerted and specific effort to do so.\n#### Customer research\nIt is actually a relatively simple yet often neglected aspect of regional geothermal database development, to recognise who the biggest customers might be, and where are they are. Furthermore, to map where awareness is generally good, and communities are naturally well-disposed to geothermal development. That might not be because of prior geothermal projects, it might reflect a locally greater awareness of things relating to the subsurface because of past mining or oil and gas activities, or simply just the idiosyncrasy of a local community that it \u201cgets\u201d it and likes it.\nCommunities are different. Part of this aspect is recognising where there are long-lived environmental or social heritages to preserve, and to understand that there will rightly be a more stringent case to answer in those areas.\nSo for starters, we can understand what the key industries are in an area, and which of them use a lot of heat, and which ones are either already overlying an existing resource, or would be amenable and flexible enough to commission new projects in the areas where good resource is. Cement plants, brick drying plants, big agricultural and horticultural operatives. Big food processing pants. Military installations or storage warehouses or transport hubs with big space heating needs. Hospitals or universities or big new residential developments. Especially those where there might be a district heating network established already but supplied with non-geothermal heat.\nA quasi-obvious aspect of this customer requirement is understanding where and how often places get cold, how cold, and equally if cooling is on the agenda too, how hot and when.\n![]( G\u00f6nen Agriculture Based Specialized Greenhouse Organized Industrial Zone (source: G\u00f6nen TDIOSB)\nOf course, part of this is full mapping of where the already existing geothermal customers are too, to know where the expansion story can be told most easily. It may surprise many to know where existing geothermal, especially shallow, low temperature, reservoir dependent geothermal for heat with heat pumps, is already being deployed with good effect \u2013 such as central London.\nTo my mind, if we exerted as much effort in approaching and corralling the industrial bodies of customers with a usage most well matched to geothermal \u2013 as we did to mapping static geological character \u2013 we would be in a much better place. That\u2019s not to say they are all going to fall head over heals in love with geothermal, but for some of them it will be a logical, sensible, and attractive option to at least evaluate alongside others. So often we are simply not even managing to get industries that far.\nFor those industries spending tens or hundreds of millions of pounds\/dollars\/euros on new facilities this is especially the case. There is a lot to gain when we consider the energy demands of such facilities over some decades.\n#### Competing-option research\nIt is a feature of our time of transition that much trumpeting occurs of what is technically possible. Always though, the imperative is not to demonstrate what is technically possible, but what makes most commercial sense of all the options available. There is competition. That competition is just as much constantly evolving as all the geothermal options are. So there is a need, for any customer to be truly engaged in going forward, to demonstrate not only that geothermal is possible, but that it is the best option for them, where they are, over the timescale of a project life. Including comparison against all the other competing energy suppliers. For them 24\/7 might not be the selling point we sometimes think it is, if it precludes making use of cheaper energy supplies when they are available. The market is changing.\nMuch of the groundwork for that competitor analysis is not that hard. We can know and map where wind, and hydroelectric, and solar resource has lots of potential already, and quickly get a rough idea of costs. We can know where fossil fuel based thermal power plants are located and where they are either at the start of their life, or their end. We can map where electrical grids are, where gross heat demand is, where existing district heating networks are, and where waste heat, incinerators or biomass heat options are located. We can identify where various types of energy storage might be viable. These things may sound basic, but a country can map and publicise such things relatively easily and instantly help focus where effort is best concentrated from a competitive standpoint.\n![]( Station in Beaver County, Utah, the location of Fervo Energy\u2019s planned 400-MW geothermal project (source: Business Wire)\nUnderstanding the competition in this way is not merely a case of knowing where to avoid and not waste time. It is allows the more systemic thinking of how the various options can work together in a complementary approach. Now that always sounds nice, and in truth, the complexities on a commercial and engineering front of doing things together, itself has a \u201ctrickiness\u201d that is often underestimated. Nevertheless, there are those places where things might genuinely work together, and this kind of research can help uncover those. Not least places where subsurface thermal energy storage might be feasible.\n#### Wider strategic database imperatives\nThere has been a lot of discussion so far, about the merits of putting a good \u201cempowering\u201d geothermal database together. Yet any organisation, state or otherwise, that undertakes to do so is not going to simply out of the goodness of its heart. It will want a good story and business case as to why it is useful to do so amidst all the other demands on its purse. I\u2019m not going to embark on that exercise here \u2013 I simply note that it has to be done. It can be. What I think is worth stressing here though, is that the kinds of database collation described here, have potential use that goes far beyond geothermal applications.\n![]( temperature model from GeotIS (source: T. Agemar\/ GeotIS)\nThere is in 2025 a wider strategic imperative for any country to know its subsurface well. This for reasons of various fluid storage, hydrogeological resource, mineral resource, as well as geothermal resource, and the interactions of all these with each other. There is no reason why any national geothermal database effort can\u2019t be effectively coordinated with other resource requirements for the responsible management of ongoing national strategic goals. Such an effort is going to arrive eventually, it may as well start out how it means to continue.\n#### Summary\nThe good news is that many key aspects of the conditions for effective geothermal deployments are being assembled as we speak.\nThe tougher message is that any condition that is not being assembled is essentially a barrier to wider scale up.\nThe list of seven below is unlikely to be exhaustive, and I fully expect others will think of other things to incorporate. However, I highlight them as a core focus of any significant expansion of conventional, mature technology geothermal deployment options, even as the more adventurous experiment with the newer, less mature technology options.\nA core seven pre-conditions required for conventional geothermal up-scale:\n1. Detailed case study analysis.\n2. Defined and favourable regulatory\/legal environment.\n3. Experienced geothermal expertise \u2013 geoscience, drilling, facilities.\n4. Risk identification with place and customer specific mitigation strategies.\n5.

    "Indicator":"Despite the proven potential of geothermal energy, its broader deployment is hindered by regulatory hurdles, financing challenges, lack of industry awareness, and the complexity of synchronizing multiple enabling factors. The article emphasizes the need for comprehensive regional geothermal databases that include static and dynamic data, along with customer and competitor research to facilitate faster project development. Achieving large-scale geothermal adoption requires coordinated efforts across technical expertise, regulatory clarity, market awareness, and resource data integration to overcome existing inertia. While many conditions are emerging favorably, the absence of fully assembled preconditions remains a key barrier to unlocking geothermal's full potential in the energy mix.",

The new law primarily makes the development of shallow geothermal projects \u2013 defined by the law as being less than 400 meters depth and at temperatures below 90 \u00b0C \u2013 by removing the requirement for a geothermal concession for such projects to operate.\nThe law also creates a National Registry for Shallow Uses of Geothermal Energy. to be managed by the Ministry of Energy, where new and existing shallow geothermal operations will be compulsorily registered.\nAside from the provisions on shallow geothermal energy, the new law further modifies the Geothermal Law with the following provisions:\n* Places the authority on supervision, regulations, and technical standards of the Geothermal Law into the Superintendence of Electricity and Fuels, thus consolidating authority into a singular body.\n* Transfers the function of maintaining the registry of geothermal concessions to the Ministry of Energy.\n* Restricts groundwater use rights granted by the Geothermal Law to geothermal concessionaires to water necessary only for exploration and exploitation work.\n* Mandates the Ministry of Energy to issue regulations establishing general safety standards for the utilization of geothermal energy, including measures to prevent and control risks to life, health, and safety of people, safeguarding the sustainability of the geothermal resources, and protecting facilities and infrastructure.\nRegulations on shallow geothermal energy use and safety must be issued within 18 months of publication of the law. These regulations shall then come into force upon publication on the Official Gazette.\nSeveral shallow geothermal projects are currently under development under Chile, many of which are under the leadership of\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area 27 Oct 2025 Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program 15 Oct 2025 California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Arup 13 Oct 2025 Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Aru ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brazil approves creation of a National Geothermal Energy Program 1 Oct 2025 Brazil approves creation of a National Geothermal Energy Program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Growing geothermal momentum in focus at the 3rd Budapest Geothermal Energy Summit 30 Sep 2025 Growing geothermal momentum in focus at the 3rd Budapest Geothermal Energy Summit ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells 25 Sep 2025 Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GEOENERG\u00cdA presents proposals for draft Royal Decree on heating and cooling networks in Spain 19 Sep 2025 GEOENERG\u00cdA presents proposals for draft Royal Decree on heating and cooling networks in Spain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![India publishes National Policy setting a framework for geothermal development 17 Sep 2025 India publishes National Policy setting a framework for geothermal development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![El Salvador legislation approves Geothermal Energy Law 11 Sep 2025 El Salvador legislation approves Geothermal Energy Law ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Bringing geothermal in from the margins \u2013 Anne Murrell, Lead of the Geothermal UK Coalition 8 Sep 2025 Bringing geothermal in from the margins \u2013 Anne Murrell, Lead of the Geothermal UK Coalition ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

However, it cannot be argued that they are invaluable in subsurface characterization and pinpointing high-potential sites for drilling.\nIn this guest article by\nThe success of a recent 3D seismic survey in Western Switzerland underlines the importance of high-quality seismic data for geothermal exploration. This pilot project around the town of Ecl\u00e9pens in the canton of Vaud could show a more secure and efficient path to developing geothermal energy and increasing the impact geothermal energy has on the green energy market.\n#### Precision exploration tools as an enabler for geothermal growth\nGlobal interest in geothermal energy for both heat and electricity is rapidly increasing. 88 countries currently produce heat from geothermal sources and 29 countries have geothermal electricity plants (Geothermie Swiss, 2024), however the impact that geothermal energy has on the total energy market is minimal.\nIdentifying potential geothermal resources and pinpointing optimal exploratory drilling locations remains the challenging dimension to successful geothermal exploitation. Multiple abandoned attempts to harness geothermal energy can be linked to lack of knowledge of the subsurface which results in wasting time and money and diminishing public support for future projects.\nCareful planning and implementing of detailed seismic surveys in the early stages of geothermal projects gives the crucial insight needed for stakeholders to advance confidently with real data in hand to support decision-making. This is acutely important in Europe where geothermal exploration and development has particular constraints linked to dense urbanisation, strict government permitting, and often strong local community objections.\nEurope is still heavily dependent on gas, oil and nuclear power to reach its increased winter energy demands that cannot be entirely covered by the intermittent energy supplied by wind or solar. Geothermal solutions exist to fill this gap, linking in with existing local energy providers and district heating projects. These projects are reliant, however, on finding geothermal reservoirs with precise conditions and properties adapted to energy production. With recent advances in seismic technology, high-resolution, dense seismic surveys are helping kick-start future geothermal projects all over Europe, providing a lower-cost method for acquiring a high-quality image of the subsurface.\nA Case Study in Ecl\u00e9pens, Western Switzerland\nMuch of the Swiss plateau has been earmarked for its geothermal potential. While the regional geology is well known, there are very few areas that have been subject to detailed subsurface investigations. Potential medium depth geothermal targets in the sedimentary layers of the Molasse basin are intersected by zones of faults, fractures and shearing which were created as sedimentary layers in the Swiss plateau were pushed up against the Jura mountains.\nUnderstanding the amplitude and orientation of faults, fractures, and geological features, as well as specific properties affecting geothermal brine flow and temperature, such as porosity and permeability, is essential for planning well location and trajectory. Detailed geological modelling using high -resolution, 3D seismic surveys combined with existing well log data and surface geology features, is an essential tool for interpreting the subsurface and planning geothermal projects.\nIn the search for potential geothermal resources, the area around Ecl\u00e9pens, in the canton of Vaud was selected as a target survey area after strong geothermal indicators were detected in the 1981 Ecl\u00e9pens-1 well (M. Baykulov et al., 2024). An unusually high geothermal gradient was detected in the well, with temperatures above 100 \u00b0C at depths of 2000m, which indicates a potential geothermal resource that could provide not only energy for district heating systems but also geothermal electricity production. Legacy 2D seismic survey data already existed in the area but did not provide enough detail for accurate planning and execution of preliminary geothermal well placement.\n![]( source operations at night (source: STRYDE)\n#### The survey proper\nThe survey includes 3 major stages:\n1. Planning and Permitting\nA thorough planning and permitting stage was carried out to ensure a consequent smooth and rapid acquisition process. This results in lower impact to the community and environment, higher efficiency and therefore lower costs. As well as receiving all required licensing and permits from the local and regional authorities, the contractors worked with private, agricultural and industrial landowners to facilitate land access during the acquisition process.\nDiligent planning of the seismic source and receiver layout was undertaken to achieve optimal coverage of the area and preserve the density of the acquired traces. A theoretical, preliminary grid layout was designed taking in consideration the tectonic fault lines described in earlier, regional models and oriented so that the fault lines could be optimally imaged (M. Baykulov et al., 2024). This theoretical grid was then significantly adjusted to real-life conditions using GIS software to account for obstacles in the landscape and no-permit zones.\nThe seismic acquisition contractor,\nSTRYDE has developed a streamlined node, small enough to fit in the palm of your hand and stripped of redundant components. These small, lightweight receivers enabled the survey to be conducted with minimal impact to the environment and local community because of the reduced equipment burden and the ease of deployment on foot or with smaller vehicles. The use of lightweight, cable-free nodes also increases trace density as the number of nodes deployed is easily increased around obstacles or target areas with little change to acquisition time or team size.\n![]( crew using lightweight vehicles to transport high-channel counts of nodes into the field, minimising vehicle emissions and local disruption (source: STRYDE)\n1. Seismic Survey Acquisition\nA total of 21,475 individual STRYDE autonomous nodes were deployed by Geo2X at the Ecl\u00e9pens site over 11 days following the pre-planned orthogonal source and receiver grid layout. The area was split into four team quadrants with one vibroseis truck working in each quadrant. Careful attention was applied to the distance between sources (to avoid interference) and the vibration levels in proximity to buildings (as per the Swiss regulations).\nThe simplicity of STRYDE nodes and their consequent recording reliability and robustness results in minimal field quality controls. These nodes have precise time synchronization and GNSS positioning and have done away with redundant and unnecessary capabilities that relay live information to the field team during the survey \u2013 a hangover from the days of fragile, cabled systems and sparse survey spacing where any data gaps were an impediment to survey results.\nThe reliability of the STRYDE nodes means that, once deployed and synched, they do not need to be tracked in the field. In contrast, seismic receivers that relay data to the field team in real-time are more expensive, bulkier, need more battery life and have more components susceptible to malfunction. In the Ecl\u00e9pens survey, 99% of data was recovered from the STRYDE nodes (M. Baykulov et al., 2024) and material loss or damage was minimal.\nPreliminary assessment of the data can be carried out when the nodes are harvested or redeployed. Data QCs can be performed on preliminary data sets using specialized, on-site software components. STRYDE\u2019s streamlined node harvesting systems and unique in-field software processing tools allow for rapid turnover of node acquisition and deployment and a reliable first look at data while operations are continuing. This process has replaced the redundant, in-field QC process of bulky real time geophones which gave limited, positioning information and reflection data without any processing capabilities.\nTo achieve the high channel count required for dense, 3D, urban surveys, large numbers of receiver nodes need to be deployed across often complicated urban areas. The risk of receivers being lost, damaged or tampered with is higher in urban areas and can result in incomplete data sets or added delays and cost increases to the project, this is regardless of real-time QC or tracking seen on bigger and more costly geophone systems.\nSTRYDE is known for its low node loss record, with very small numbers of deployed nodes missing through tampering, theft or damage. The compact size of the STRYDE node allows it to be easily buried or hidden and therefore not obvious to passersby. The node loss count for the Ecl\u00e9pens survey was less than 2 % and did not impact data continuity. The small size of the nodes also means that they are highly mobile, easily carried on foot with streamlined deployment and retrieval using smaller crew sizes. This flexibility was beneficial in a survey area like Ecl\u00e9pens with complicated mixed-purpose urban and agricultural areas and limited heavy vehicle access.\n![]( of the Western Switzerland with outline of the Ecl\u00e9pens 3D seismic survey (left) and the source and receiver survey layout (right). (source: M. Baykulov et al., 2024).\n1. Data Processing, Interpretation and Well Placement\nFast-track processing of the acquired data sets gave an early overview of the quality of the data and enabled comparisons to the regional macro-structures and the legacy 2D data sets. The data went through preliminary conditioning techniques which include noise reduction, signal enhancement, and correction for any data inconsistencies. This ensures that the data sets are of the highest quality before further, more sophisticated processing.\nA first-look, comparative analysis of pre-STM data imaging already showed the enhanced detail of the 2023 3D data set, compared with the vintage 2D seismic images with reduced seismic noise, less chaotic signatures and more continuity in reflectors. Comparison of the NW-SE linear 2D line with an identical spatial line from the new data showed the lack of continuity in seismic reflectors of the 2D data and an overall chaotic signature (M. Baykulov et al., 2024).\n![]( of the vintage 2D line acquired in the 1970s (left) to the preliminary PreSTM product from Ecl\u00e9pens 3D result (right) (source: M. Baykulov et al., 2024).\nCommon urban obstacles such as roads and buildings limit the acquisition of straight line 2D seismic. 3D surveys, however, can combine information from all directions with many different source-receiver combinations which can work around obstacles or voids in the survey area. Given the high volume and density of the data, data gaps can also be compensated by advanced interpolation techniques during data processing.\nThanks to the high resolution of the seismic signal obtained in the Ecl\u00e9pens survey, a series of sophisticated data processing techniques were applied to the dataset in order to produce a more complete and accurate seismic model of the area. These techniques include, for example, Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI), Common Reflection Angle Migration (CRAM), rock property inversion and Reverse Time migration (RTM) which help to further refine the seismic image and enhance subsurface characterisation.\nBy integrating the processed seismic survey data with existing well log data, detailed and accurate 3D geological models can be produced. The final models are key project management tools that are essential to decision making for well location, trajectory, depth etc. These models provide the best possible estimation of the target resource and are key in supporting all aspects of geothermal projects, from planning to engineering, mitigating risks and project cost reduction.\n#### Conclusions\nThe benefits of high-density, 3D seismic surveys have already been extensively exploited in other industries such as petroleum, nuclear waste storage, mineral exploration, etc. The Ecl\u00e9pens case study shows how seismic reflection surveys can be performed to high industry standards, with high-quality data sets and streamlined operational performance, while keeping acquisition costs low enough to benefit the renewable energy industry.\nThese surveys add real value to geothermal exploration projects by bringing more clarity to the subsurface and aiding decision-making. High-resolution geological models from dense 3D geophysical surveys are the most robust tools available to evaluate the target resource and plan well locations and trajectories.\nThrough a combination of thorough and diligent planning and permitting stages along with advanced seismic acquisition technology such as the STRYDE receiver node, it is now possible to bring high-density, 3D surveys to the geothermal market.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Technology\n# What role will geothermal play in the energy transition of Saudi Arabia?\n!What role will geothermal play in the energy transition of Saudi Arabia? What role will geothermal play in the energy transition of Saudi Arabia? (Inset image source:\n![ ](\n![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 4 Mar 2025\nWith a wealth of oil and gas experience, Saudi Arabia is uniquely positioned for geothermal development. But what will it take to turn potential to reality?\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nAs one of the world\u2019s biggest oil producers and the leading oil exporter, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia owes a great deal of its progress and wealth to the discovery and continued extraction of petroleum products. The nation\u2019s power sector is also heavily reliant on hydrocarbons, which is hardly surprising considering its affordability and supply.\nHowever, even an oil giant like Saudi Arabia is making changes towards a more low-carbon future. With an ambitious renewable energy target of 50% of its power supply by 2030, is there a prominent role for geothermal in Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy mix?\nTo answer this, we examined\n* Naceur Ghannem\n* Osamah Al-Momen\n* Mahmoud AlGaiar\n#### Geothermal prospects and potential in Saudi Arabia\nThe classical geological characteristics that indicate potential for geothermal resources are clustered at the western region of Saudi Arabia. The \u201cHarrat\u201d volcanic field comprises over 2500 dormant volcanoes and many hot springs, with temperatures reaching 80 \u00b0C.\nEarly studies in the region indicate low-to-medium temperature gradients, with an exceptionally higher gradient in the Jizan area to the south. There has also been some early exploration done near Harrat Rahat that have hinted at potential \u201csweet spots\u201d for geothermal energy. However, there is not enough analysis done to come up with accurate estimates of geothermal resources and reserves.\nThe eastern part of Saudi Arabia comprises the Arabian Platform, which are sedimentary formations that contain the nation\u2019s hydrocarbon resources. Some of the oil and gas wells in this region have been able to tap into geothermal temperatures sufficient for various applications. Various synergies can also be explored, such as for hydrogen production and carbon capture and storage.\n![]( geothermal features in Saudi Arabia (source: Lashin et al, 2020)\nAside from geothermal\u2019s potential to supplement Saudi Arabia\u2019s electricity grid, it can also contribute significantly to the nation\u2019s cooling needs. Studies show that cooling consumes 101 TWh of electricity in residences and 70 TWh in commercial establishments, accounting for 50% of total yearly electricity usage. This figure can go up to 70% during periods of peak cooling demand.\nIn the Middle East region, a noteworthy example of geothermal used for cooling is already operational in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. This is a special case as it uses heat from deep geothermal wells to run an absorption cooling system. However, shallower geoexchange systems can provide a more practical and technologically simpler pathway for geothermal cooling in Saudi Arabia.\nGeothermal can also supply both heat and power for the region\u2019s water desalination plants. With a scarcity of freshwater, the region is highly dependent on desalination of seawater. This is an energy-intensive, yet highly critical, process. As a heat source, geothermal heat can be used directly in thermal desalination methods.\n#### The current status of geothermal in Saudi Arabia\nIn 2020, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia announced a goal to generate 50% of its power from renewables by 2030, thus displacing 1 million barrels per day of liquid fuels. However, this goal states no preference when it comes to technology.\n\u201cSaudi Arabia is looking into multiple energy pathways, including conventional oil and gas. But they are also looking at cleaner energy and renewables, including solar and a little bit of wind. They are also looking at hydrogen as well. Geothermal is a new focus,\u201d\nAs is with most parts of the world, geothermal in Saudi Arabia has not received as much attention as other renewable energy technologies. There remains a lack of understanding of geothermal, and there is limited awareness of its benefits. Available public data is not enough to create a robust assessment of the geothermal potential in the region.\nOn a positive note, there are already various exploration efforts for geothermal in Saudi Arabia. The most visible example would likely be the exploratory work being done at the which broke ground in early 2024. This is a pilot project that aims to use a relatively shallow (400 meters depth) geothermal well for reconnaissance, monitoring, and testing of new technologies. The project is led by KAUST Research Professor in Energy Resources and Petroleum Engineering Thomas Finkbeiner, with\nOther exploration projects are less public, but there is nevertheless some interesting work ongoing in the geothermal space in Saudi Arabia.\n![]( of geothermal research well at KAUST, Saudi Arabia (source: KAUST)\nFrom a revenue perspective, it is also beneficial for Saudi Arabia to develop a more diverse and optimized energy industry. \u201cEnergy in this region is subsidized by governments. As both the population and the industrial sector grow, there is also a higher demand for energy. Thus, that subsidy is also going to increase. So, governments have to look at ways to optimize the energy sector and look at alternatives. Geothermal can be one of those alternatives,\u201d\n#### The role of the oil and gas industry\nWith a rich history in oil and gas exploration and extraction, Saudi Arabia is uniquely positioned to leverage existing skills and technologies for geothermal development. Many technologies essential in geothermal, such as directional drilling and well stimulation, are already deployed in Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil and gas sector.\nDuring the opening ceremony of the International Petroleum Technology Conference, His Royal Highness Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al-Saud, the Minister of Energy, mentioned that state-owned petroleum company Saudi Aramco will be a key enabler in advancing geothermal at the rapid rate needed to meet energy diversification and climate goals. Given its extensive history of oil and natural gas exploration, Saudi Aramco has knowledge of the Kingdom\u2019s geology more than any other entity in the geothermal field.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s long history with oil and gas also means that the Kingdom has established long-standing relationships with service providers, many of which have a global footprint and experience in both oil and gas and geothermal. Baker Hughes is one such example.\n\u201cWe have 40 years of experience in geothermal,\u201d\u201cBaker Hughes has been a part of a large number of geothermal projects, providing expertise in many areas including reservoir analysis, geomechanics, and tools for high pressure and high temperature environments. Our portfolio covers the whole value chain of geothermal project development.\u201d\nAs Membership Chair of the SPE Geothermal Technical Section (GTTS) in the Middle East, AlGaiar also actively advocates for cross-industry collaboration, mobilizing oil and gas expertise to facilitate geothermal development. \u201cWe are trying to promote geothermal at every upcoming local conference, making sure that there is a dedicated panel for geothermal. We are making sure that geothermal is available at each conference and that there are geothermal topics that participants can submit papers for.\n![]( 2024 Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition & Conference (ADIPEC) in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (source: ADIPEC)\nThe SPE GTTS aims to aid geothermal development in the Middle East region through the collection, dissemination, and sharing of technical knowledge related to geothermal energy, while demonstrating its link to traditional oil and gas disciplines. Through collaboration between the two fields, the SPE GTTS is also promoting industry best practices via knowledge and skills transfer.\nThe repurposing of abandoned oil and gas wells presents another possible pathway for geothermal development in Saudi Arabia. Converting or enhancing depleted oil and gas wells into geothermal wells will help offset their abandonment costs while producing clean energy and extending the wells\u2019 lifespans. Baker Hughes, as the leader of the Wells2Watts consortium, is already working on a closed-loop single-well technology designed specifically for this geothermal use case.\n#### A pathway for geothermal energy in the Middle East\n\u201cBig companies would like to enter the market in Saudi Arabia,\u201d\u201cBut currently there are no geothermal projects yet and the sector is only at the exploration phase.\u201d\nThe geothermal sector of Saudi Arabia is currently at a very nascent phase, and there will have to be more investment put into research and drilling campaigns. It is also necessary to implement regulations and incentives to encourage businesses to introduce geothermal technologies to the market and streamline the adoption of these technologies.\nThe KAPSARC paper cites the example of the 2020 Saudi mining investment law. This law created a mining fund that supported exploration programs, research and studies, and mining-related infrastructure projects. A similarly enabling environment can help accelerate the deployment of geothermal by incentivizing exploration, investment, and research.\nOn the part of technology partners, Ghannem mentions three key pillars that can help support geothermal \u2013 technology, vision, and the motivation.\nA positive sign of support for geothermal in the Kingdom is the multiple stakeholders seemingly taking ownership of various aspects of geothermal research and exploration. \u201cKAUST is coming from the academia and technology side, KAPSARC is taking the lead in the policy side of things, and Saudi Aramco is taking the lead on the operational and execution side,\u201d\n\u201cAs Baker Hughes, we are also coming in from the service side. So, there are several stakeholders in the Kingdom that are pushing the geothermal agenda.\u201d\n\u201cI am sure that, one day, geothermal in Saudi Arabia will move from exploration to appraisal,\u201d\u201cI think the motivation is there. We do have the development expertise and the technology here. We only need cooperation among researchers, investors, policymakers, and other stakeholders of the energy ecosystem.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that we are in an energy transition. Rather, what we need is an energy addition,\u201d\u201cWe are in an industrial revolution and we are consuming a lot of energy for AI and data centres. The more that AI becomes essential in industries, the more power we will need.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone is now investing in geothermal, including technology giants like Microsoft and Google. Geothermal will be there in the equation of energy, no matter what the main problem is. It is now underrated because of the high upfront cost, but if we can get the levelized cost of energy or heat that is competitive to other renewables, especially with the high capacity factor of geothermal, then it\u2019s a win-win scenario.\u201d\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![\u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 28 Oct 2025 \u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

This work package will be instrumental in guiding any potential site selection and detailed engineering work that would be used to deploy the network as well as in the pursuit of funding sources to support the work.\nThe Consultant is expected to support IFC in proposing and assessing the overall feasibility of deploying networked geothermal systems in Kyrgyzstan.\nThe assignment will be to conduct an analysis across two feasibility metrics:\n* Metric 1 will be technical feasibility. This will involve the review and analysis of the potential performance of a network of ground sourced heat pumps in Kyrgyzstan. This should be based on available documentation and information on the local geology, ground temperatures, drilling conditions, building stock, regulatory environment, and climate zone data. Specific attention should be given to an estimate of potential borefield performance in Kyrgyzstan and a review of any existing ground source heat pump systems currently in operation.\n* Metric 2 will be economic feasibility. This will involve analysis of the potential economics of a networked geothermal deployment in Kyrgyzstan. Specifically, a review of the estimated installation costs for a district scale system that could serve on the order of 10,000-30,000 household equivalents. The analysis should also compare the costs for average customers to operate a ground source heat pump to existing costs for heating and cooling using traditional solutions. Any current subsidies for either heating or electricity will also be critical to this analysis in order to get a full picture of the overall performance vs cost.\nInternational consultants or consultants located outside of the Kyrgyzstan, should have a local partner and the details should be included in the EOI.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya 28 Oct 2025 Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area 27 Oct 2025 Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines 22 Oct 2025 EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia 20 Oct 2025 Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia 17 Oct 2025 Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation 16 Oct 2025 China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated 16 Oct 2025 Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia 8 Oct 2025 Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia 3 Oct 2025 Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Subject to final investment decision, Contact Energy is also planning a second phase of development, Te Mihi Stage 3, which is expected to come online by mid-2031.\nThis significant agreement marks Ormat\u2019s fourth large project in New Zealand currently under development and is expected to replace, in stages, the 1950\u2019s-built Wairakei geothermal power station. It also highlights Ormat\u2019s advantages in developing binary technology, which is also suitable for high enthalpy geothermal reservoirs.\nDoron Blachar, Chief Executive Officer of Ormat Technologies, commented: \u201cWe are thrilled to partner with Contact Energy on this landmark geothermal project. The Te Mihi Stage 2 project is a testament to Ormat\u2019s commitment to delivering cutting-edge geothermal solutions that drive the transition to clean energy. We expect that our year-end Product Segment backlog, once the contract is signed, will exceed $300 million and we will recognize the bulk of the revenues associated with this contract during 2026 and 2027.\u201d\n\u201cThe 101MW Te Mihi Stage 2 plant, along with the additional 160MW we are currently building in New Zealand, strengthens our position as market leader while also expanding New Zealand\u2019s renewable energy capacity to support the country\u2019s ambitious goal of achieving zero emissions.

Guti\u00e9rrez-Negr\u00edn and Andrew Chiasson. The book comprises 28 chapters written by 40 authors from 12 countries, namely, Chile, Costa Rica, Germany, Iceland, Indonesia, Italy, Kenya, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, United Kingdom and United States. There is also an appendix with data on installed geothermal power plants across the world showing trends and projections for the near-term.\n#### Representing eight years of progress\nIn the eight years following the first edition, geothermal power has continued to be a steady and reliable source of electricity to nearly 70 million people around the world. The number of countries served by geothermal power plants has risen from 24 in 2015 to 32, with another 11 poised to join the geothermal club of nations. In 2015, about 12 GW of geothermal power was installed, whereas now the total exceeds 16 GW, representing nearly 4% annual growth.\nThe book is organized into four sections:\nPart One\nPart Two\nPart Three\nPart Four\nThe first three sections follow the typical chronological order in the development of a resource, from the beginning of exploration through to the options for engineering a power plant, including environmental, economic, social and cultural considerations.\nThe chapters are descriptive while giving enough analytical material to allow readers to apply scientific principles to understand the design and performance of various plants. The last section includes eight chapters describing actual plants operating around the world, from the earliest ones in Italy, now over 120 years ago, to recent developments in Kenya, and several other countries and regions.\nThroughout the book, color photographs and diagrams are used to convey the nature of geothermal resources and a physical sense of different power plant designs, including dry steam, single-, double-, and triple-flash, to a variety of binary and hybrid plants. Extensive reference lists and bibliographies accompany each chapter for further in-depth reading and research.\n#### New chapters on innovations and emerging regions\nThe second edition includes several new chapters dealing with developments in the Philippines, Central America and the Caribbean, Chile, and Kenya. Another new chapter presents a case study of the large geothermal field at Cerro Prieto in Mexico that has been in continuous operation for over 50 years since 1973.\nInnovations and emerging technologies include Advanced Deep Drilling (ADD) and Mineral Recovery (MR) from geothermal brines. While neither of these emerging technologies has been brought to the commercial stage, they promise results in the near term. So far, ADD has demonstrated that existing productive fields can be enhanced, but no power plant has been developed solely by using ADD techniques. Likewise, mineral recovery, in particular the recovery of lithium, has been demonstrated in laboratory tests using simulated brines, and pilot demonstration plants have been designed, however extending the concepts to full-scale operation at a real power plant, or as a stand-alone mineral recovery plant, has so far proven highly challenging.\n![]( Prieto geothermal plant (source: Government of Baja California, creative commons)\n#### A book for both geothermal and non-geothermal readers\nThe following is excerpted from a book review by Susan Fox Hodgson, California Div. of Oil, Gas and Geothermal, retired.\n> Geothermal Power Generation: Developments and Innovation, Second Edition\n> Some chapters touch on geothermal history. An example is Chapter 21, titled \u201cLarderello, Italy: The Oldest Geothermal Field in Operation in the World.\u201d The chapter begins with a Prologue, \u201c\u2026an historical outline, beginning in Prehistory, of Italian geothermal development up to 1960, with particular reference to the Boraciferous Region.\u201d The Prologue, by Raffaele Cataldi, is followed by technical information from authors, Roberto Parri, Franco Lazzeri, and Alessandro Lenzi. The issues they discuss include \u201c\u2026studies and pilot tests on new materials and\/or alloys for turbines and auxiliary equipment.\u201d\n> It doesn\u2019t matter if you work in geothermal or don\u2019t know the first thing about it. The book is for you. If you are unfamiliar with geothermal power plants, someday you may need a few geothermal facts. Say out of the blue, a developer suggests building a geothermal power plant in your area. You and other residents want to understand the project. Reading through the chapter titles can help guide you to the information you need. Geothermal developers will find the book useful, as well. Talking to (or teaching) community groups about geothermal energy and answering their questions is part of the job.\n> The chapters are well-illustrated with helpful maps, photos, and figures. About 75 percent of the illustrations are in color, which I enjoyed.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University 2 Oct 2025 PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![New free online course on shallow geothermal energy available on edX 30 Sep 2025 New free online course on shallow geothermal energy available on edX ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France 18 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest 15 Sep 2025 Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![TEDx talk highlights the global geothermal energy opportunity 15 Sep 2025 TEDx talk highlights the global geothermal energy opportunity ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees 12 Sep 2025 Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Your input needed \u2013 Survey on Geothermal Education Opportunities 8 Sep 2025 Your input needed \u2013 Survey on Geothermal Education Opportunities ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Free workshop on Volsung by Seequent, 6 October 2025, Zurich 5 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Free workshop on Volsung by Seequent, 6 October 2025, Zurich ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Course on Risk & uncertainty for geothermal projects; Ankara, T\u00fcrkiye 3 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Course on Risk & uncertainty for geothermal projects; Ankara, T\u00fcrkiy ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling completed for geothermal heating in Garges-l\u00e8s-Gonesse, France 28 Aug 2025 Drilling completed for geothermal heating in Garges-l\u00e8s-Gonesse, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![UK universities strengthen seismic imaging research with STRYDE nodes 27 Aug 2025 UK universities strengthen seismic imaging research with STRYDE nodes ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

In 2002, the municipality of Pullach in the Isar Valley founded Innovative Energy for Pullach (IEP), and since 2005 households and businesses have benefited from the regional, climate-friendly, safe heat from the depths. The Pullach network has been steadily expanded since then, and further drilling is planned. A new feature is the sale of CO2 certificates. On today\u2019s day of the congress, the proceeds went to Pullach\u2019s partner municipality in Ukraine to help them survive the coming winter.\n\u201cBavaria is a pioneer in geothermal energy. Today we both want to help to ensure that the topic is not only pushed in Bavaria, but nationwide,\u201d \u201cWe hope that with the program we can help to implement projects that might not otherwise be possible.\u201d\n\u201cA huge compliment to KfW for the short time in which such a program was able to be implemented here,\u201d\n#### Conditionally repayable loan for feasibility studies\nA geothermal drilling costs many millions of euros. If no \u2013 or too little \u2013 hot deep water is found underground, the money is literally wasted. This is a risk that is difficult for municipalities and public utilities in particular to bear.\nTo held manage these risks, KfW is planning a geothermal energy development loan that will seamlessly follow on from BAFA funding for, among other things, feasibility studies prior to drilling. The mechanism combines financing with risk protection. The loan from the federal funding is conditionally repayable and provides for debt relief of up to 100 percent of the bank loan for the drilling if no or only partial discovery is made. It can be combined with the federal funding for efficient heating networks (BEW).\n\u201cThis should also secure financing that might not otherwise be available through banks,\u201d\nThe start is planned for January 2025, but is still subject to budgetary approval. Otherwise, everything is prepared. \u201cWe have spoken in detail with the four major banking associations and interested financing partners, whom we inform as standard before introducing programs,\u201d\n#### Insurance for geothermal drilling\n\u201cLack of exploration is still the main risk in geothermal energy. Only 73% of wells find something on the first attempt. In 16% of cases, sufficient exploration can still be achieved after the well has been upgraded. 11% do not find anything,\u201d\u201cThe better the data, the better a project can be insured.\u201d\nFor their part, Munich Re is offering exploration insurance focusing on municipal heat supply and on industry with heat requirements. It corresponds to the drilling costs and also includes a dynamic adjustment to possible rising costs and stimulation measures, such as drilling a sidetrack or acidifying an initially dry well. The possible payout is defined based on the thermal output achieved.\nIn the event of partial exploration, there is a partial payout. The risk assessment and thus the premium are influenced by various factors, e.g. the geographical location, the data situation and the insured benefits or a possible deductible.\n\u201cThe program in combination with KfW now makes it possible to insure projects that were previously uninsurable and will give the industry a huge boost,\u201d\nProject outlines can now be submitted to Munich Re for review, and as soon as the government gives the final go-ahead after the budget has been passed, financing can begin.\n#### Extremely positive changes in framework conditions for geothermal\nThe Praxisforum Geothermie.Bayern event provided a platform to discuss the improvements in framework conditions in favor of geothermal in Germany. Organizer Dr. Jochen Schneider from \u201cA lot has happened in the past year and numerous new projects are emerging. We are pleased that things are progressing like this.\u201d\nThe federal government currently has a draft law to speed up approval procedures. The expansion of geothermal energy is therefore in the overriding public interest, and the Federal Mining Act is also due to be amended.\nAlexander Rettenberger from the Southern Bavaria Mining Authority talked about the measures that the agency is taking to improve agreements with public interest groups and authorities. In this respect, the Mining Authority\u2019s involvement in the agreements makes sense and should take place in the future. Rettenberger gave a number of tips on how applications can be made more complete and compact in order to speed up the processing of applications.\n#### Financing for geothermal in smaller municipalities\nHelmut Mangold from IEP was the last keynote speaker to address the economic viability of geothermal projects and the options available. He called for reliable political statements and reliable framework condition.\n\u201cReal renewable heat can only keep up with combined heat and power if the CO2 price reaches 150 euros,\u201d\u201cIt would also help to give renewable heat priority access to heating networks, similar to renewable electricity. We also need reliable funding regimes; without reliability, you cannot tackle a project that has a time horizon of five to ten years.\u201d\nHe also called for guarantees from the state, as the municipalities are overwhelmed by this. A future fund to finance heating projects, for example by municipal utilities, which are \u201ctoo small\u201d for many investors, would also make sense. As a new IEP project, Mangold presented the \u201cPullach Renewable Energy Heat Index (PEEWI)\u201d, to which district heating companies with a share of at least 60% renewable energy can contribute their data.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

At present, conventional geothermal wells are drilled to a maximum depth of about 3.5 km. However, scientists believe that by drilling beyond this, possibly to 6km deep, more energy will be available,\u201dRegional Development Minister Shane Jones.\n\u201cThe energy generated from supercritical geothermal technology (SCGT) could be up to three times greater than current geothermal energy from steam. In the long term this could be a game-changer for New Zealand and potentially internationally, with other countries also chasing solutions to energy challenges.\u201d\n#### Supercritical geothermal potential in the TVZ\nInitially only $5 million of the funding will be drawn down for work on the detailed design and cost to drill the first of three exploratory deep wells in the Taupo Volcanic Zone. The Crown will also engage with stakeholders, particularly local iwi and hapu, on opportunities for involvement.\nThe initiative will be led by GNS Science and the Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE). The work will be informed by GNS Science\u2019s \u201cGeothermal: The Next Generation\u201d research which was funded by MBIE\u2019s Endeavour Research Fund and years of other studies at the Taupo Volcanic Zone.\n\u201cThe science has confirmed that supercritical geothermal resources are available and abundant in the Taupo Volcanic Zone,\u201d\n\u201cThis investment and support from the Government is critical to derisking and developing the technologies that will harness this huge potential.

The project has been led by local utility\nInitial tests of the first well have yielded very positive results. \u201cInstead of 200 cubic meters per hour, we could even extract 330 cubic meters,\u201d\n#### Choosing tried and tested technology\nThe next phase of the project will involve the acquisition and installation of six large heat pumps. The heat pumps have not been ordered as permission is still needed from the mining authority. However, SWN already has their eyes on the type of heat pump they prefer and a specific manufacturer.\n\u201cWe deliberately opted for tried and tested technology rather than the latest technology,\u201d\n#### Lower heating prices by 2027\nSWN had already been given a federal grant of EUR 10 million for the project, as announced back in early 2023. This funding will go towards acquiring the technology for the project. However, SWN also intends to apply for another EUR 20 million grant that will subsidize the operation of the plant, thus reducing the price that customers will have to pay.\nWith the subsidy, residents of Neuruppin can hope for heating rates that are about 2 cents per kWh cheaper. Rates are not likely to go below the rates before the conflict in Ukraine, but they can be significantly cheaper than the current rates.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

This is typical in the medium-low enthalpy sedimentary basin-type geothermal field of the Guanzhong region.\nDuring the heating season, geothermal is utilized for low-load power generation, which cascades down to heating by heat exchange. When heating is not needed, the project generates electricity at full load. The combined heat and power plant is described to have a heating capacity of 170,000 square meters and an annual power generation capacity of about 700,000 kWh.\nThe facility also serves as a demonstration project for helium extraction. Analysis of the thermal waters in this region indicated that the helium content of most geothermal wells was exceptionally high compared to both local and international averages.\nIn recent years, Sinopec has continued to carry out water-soluble helium separation and purification experiments and key technology research in Xianyang City, and has successfully applied it to this project. Through membrane separation and pressure swing adsorption coupling process, helium with a purity of more than 99% has been obtained, providing valuable technical experience for the further industrialization of geothermal water-soluble helium.\nSinopec continues to deepen its geothermal field and has become the largest geothermal energy development and utilization company in China. Although China is currently the world leader in geothermal heating capacity, its geothermal power generation sector is still at the development stage. As of the end of 2022, the geothermal power generation of China is at 53.45 MW.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya 28 Oct 2025 Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area 27 Oct 2025 Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines 22 Oct 2025 EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia 20 Oct 2025 Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia 17 Oct 2025 Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation 16 Oct 2025 China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated 16 Oct 2025 Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia 8 Oct 2025 Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia 3 Oct 2025 Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Though short of the target 7-kilometer depth, it was nevertheless an impressive effort to set a new record for the deepest geothermal borehole for heating. For now, that record is still held by the 6.4-kilometer well in Otaniemi, Finland.\nDrilling work for the Banska PGP-4 well started in April 2023. By the end of that year, it was reported that the well had already reached the 5000-meter mark. By then, it had also intersected a large reservoir with temperature of 120 \u00b0C.\nWork had to be stopped at a depth of around 5900 meters because the drill had reached a very hard rock formation, resulting in a very slow rate of penetration. The walls of the well had also started collapsing, which had to be repaired. More so, the top drive failed and the main cable broke at a depth of 6096 meters. Drilling was resumed in July 2024.\nWith these challenges in consideration, it was decided that drilling will be terminated before the target depth had been reached. According to the initial assessment, the 120 \u00b0C resource had the greatest potential to be used for geothermal heating for the Szaflary commune and nearby areas, including the city of Nowy Targ. The well had also fulfilled its purpose as a research tool, providing subsurface information at previously unknown depths.\nTests will still have to be done to determine the temperature, productivity, and the physicochemical properties of the waters from the well. This information will be the basis for creating a model for the use of thermal waters in the entire Podhale region.\nPreparatory work for the construction of a 5.5-kilometer heating main is already ongoing. The plan is for the geothermal heat to be distributed from the heating plant in Banska Nizna. The commune is also applying for funding for the implementation of the second stage of the project, which will involve building the connection of the geothermal network to the individual users.\nGeothermal research and drilling in Szaflary will contribute greatly to the building momentum for geothermal heating in Poland. The country will soon have 11 geothermal heating plants operational, the latest ones being in Turek and Konin.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![\u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 28 Oct 2025 \u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

A report published by JOGMEC in 2023 shows that most geothermal power plants in Japan are considered small, with capacities ranging from 20 to 250 kW, largely brought about by favorable FiT rates.\n#### Community effort\nPrimarily, the plant provides the community with a reliable clean energy source available 24\/7, regardless of weather. Fortunately, even those without access to geothermal can still take steps to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions with existing conventional energy systems. For example, energy-efficient HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) systems can heat and cool homes with minimal energy loss.\nAmericans, in particular,\nLocal business owners in Tsuchiyu Onsen founded energy company, Genki Up Tsuchiyu, in order to fund and build the geothermal plant themselves. \u201cThe community bonded together to shift from nuclear energy to a source of energy that seemed safer,\nIt is estimated that Japan\u2019s ample geothermal resources can potentially generate 10% of the country\u2019s power, whereas nuclear power (which poses meltdown and radiation risks) currently accounts for 5.8% of energy production. Katsuichi Kato, President of Genki Up Tsuchiyu, said the key to the plant\u2019s success is that it was never considered merely a \u201cprofit-making\u201d tool, but rather a boon for the whole town. This sparked community spirit and everyone remained committed to the development of a sustainable town and energy plant that benefits all.\n![]( Fukushima City, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan (source:\nA boost to tourism and other industries\nOn top of clean energy efficiency, the plant is also a draw for tourists, who boost the local economy. This is particularly important for Tsuchiyu Onsen, which is only forty kilometers from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, as the nuclear disaster in 2011 had long driven tourists away from the area.\nThousands of people from across the country now visit to learn about how the geothermal power plant works. This generates further revenue for local businesses. The plant\u2019s warm waste water is even funneled off for local aquaculture projects, which farm giant river prawn. Local hotels and restaurants then serve these prawns, while tourists also fish them.\nNo intrusion upon natural environment\nThe plant at Tsuchiyu Onsen is built on top of an existing spring water well, so there was no need to drill any new wells. \u201cThis can help convince local communities throughout Japan that they can build similar projects without damaging their natural and beautiful environments,\u201d\nIndeed, as one of the world\u2019s most volcanically active countries, Japan is ripe for geothermal energy production. It\u2019s estimated the country can potentially generate around 23 gigawatts of geothermal power. As such, the Japanese government\nSmall plants like the one at Tsuchiyu Onsen \u201care unlikely to change the face of Japanese energy production on their own\u201d\u201cBut they can play an important role in getting people to understand and accept geothermal power \u2014 and pave the way for bigger plants in the future\u201d.\nSource: Written by Cristina Collin Sumner\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya 28 Oct 2025 Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area 27 Oct 2025 Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines 22 Oct 2025 EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia 20 Oct 2025 Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia 17 Oct 2025 Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation 16 Oct 2025 China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated 16 Oct 2025 Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia 8 Oct 2025 Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia 3 Oct 2025 Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Geothermal energy is a renewable, stable, and carbon-neutral energy source, with estimates suggesting it could meet up to a quarter of Europe\u2019s heating and cooling needs and up to 10% of its electricity demand. Recognized as a key driver in achieving climate neutrality by 2050 under the European Green Deal, geothermal energy is gaining increasing prominence.\nThe European Parliament\u2019s 2023 EU Policy Document on Geothermal Energy acknowledges its critical role in decarbonizing the heating and cooling sector. Additionally, in late 2023, a Report on Geothermal Energy was adopted to shape future legislative initiatives of the European Commission and provide member states with a policy framework for geothermal energy development. The urgency of geothermal energy development was reaffirmed in December 2024 by the Council of Ministers, which called on the European Commission to draft a comprehensive strategy for heating and cooling decarbonization, supported by the EU geothermal action plan, to facilitate project implementation and accelerate geothermal energy deployment.\n#### The high geothermal potential of Croatia\nCroatia boasts the highest geothermal potential in Europe, exceeding the European average by 60%, presenting both a challenge and a responsibility to harness this resource for clean and stable energy for its citizens. According to Croatia\u2019s National Energy and Climate Plan, the anticipated electricity output from geothermal sources by 2030 is expected to reach 68 MW\u2014equivalent to one-fifth of the capacity of the Croatian share in the Kr\u0161ko Nuclear Power Plant\u2019s (348 MW), which currently meets 16% of Croatia\u2019s annual electricity demand.\nHowever, with further investments, projections for 2050 are estimated at 405 MW, surpassing Croatia\u2019s share of Kr\u0161ko, meaning that over 30% of the country\u2019s electricity could come solely from geothermal and nuclear sources\u2014not even accounting for additional contributions from solar, wind, and hydropower, which are also carbon-neutral.\n\u201cCroatia holds a unique position in Europe. Our high geothermal gradient, combined with strategic investments, can position us as a geothermal leader at the European level, while providing our citizens with clean and stable energy. Geothermal energy is becoming an increasingly vital part of the energy mix\u2014Europe has recognized this, while Croatia, as a country with one of the greatest potentials, must act swiftly\u201d,\nHe further emphasized that the development of geothermal projects requires significant financial investments, which is why the conference will host representatives from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the World Bank, and the European Investment Bank (EIB).\n![]( over Zagreb, Croatia (source: flickr\/ Rudy Balasko, creative commons)\n#### The time for Croatia to position itself strategically\nPanels and discussions at the conference will cover various topics, including geothermal energy in urban development in the context of enhancing energy efficiency, with concrete examples of cities that have implemented geothermal heating and cooling systems. The focus will also be on the investment models and risk mitigation, concentrating on successful investment case studies and the use of geothermal energy in agriculture. The panelists will include representatives from leading energy companies such as ENNA, SOYAK, and SLB, as well as Members of the European Parliament, led by Croatian MEP Davor Ivo Stier.\n\u201cWe are not reinventing the wheel\u2014we are literally sitting on it \u2013 Croatia one of Europe\u2019s leading geothermal potentials, yet awareness remains low, despite a clear need at both the European and national level. This forum is the first to actively promote Croatia\u2019s geothermal potential. Now is the time for Croatia to strategically position itself and attract investment for the green energy transition,\u201d\nThe GIFC 2025 expert program committee includes representatives from: Hrvoje Po\u017ear (Energy Institute), Croatian Chamber of Economy (CCE), European Geothermal Energy Council (EGEC), Croatian Geothermal Energy Association, Faculty of Mining, Geology, and Petroleum Engineering, led by Dragutin Domitrovic, energy expert and Director of IGeoPen.\n\u201cThis conference is a clear signal that Croatia is being recognized as a key hub for geothermal energy development in Europe. Geothermal energy is a driver of economic growth and a resource that can provide stable and predictable energy today. In order to reach its full potential, it must be consistently integrated into strategic plans and implementation policies. Clear and supportive conditions for all renewable energy sources are essential, and in the case of geothermal energy, this is particularly crucial due to the complexity of such projects,\u201d\nGIFC 2025 is the project developed by Alpheus Public Affairs, co-organized by the Croatian Chamber of Economy (HGK) and in partnership with the European Geothermal Energy Council (EGEC). The conference is held under the high patronage of the Ministry of Economy of the Republic of Croatia and the European Parliament (EP). Institutional support is provided by the Croatian Hydrocarbon Agency (CHA), which has developed a unique, interactive, and publicly accessible platform mapping all geothermal exploration and exploitation sites in Croatia.\nThe CHA has also secured \u20ac30 million in grants from the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) for geothermal exploration near six Croatian cities: Vinkovci, Vukovar, Osijek, Sisak, Zapre\u0161ic, and Velika Gorica. If these prove to be successful, they could provide geothermal heating sources for households, public institutions, and businesses in these cities.\nSource: Email correspondence\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

This data shows that there is 1000-fold (or more) energy available in the form of heat underground than Pennsylvanians consume each year . There are also plenty of opportunities to use it, in some form, all across the Commonwealth\u2019s 46,000-plus square miles.\nIf the Commonwealth were to drill geothermal wells at the same rate that it is now drilling for oil and gas wells, it could generate enough geothermal energy to meet all thermal demands for its commercial heating and low-temperature industrial processes. Geothermal could also help some of the region\u2019s largest energy users\u2014the industrial and agriculture sectors\u2014reduce emissions while maintaining large numbers of jobs in the drilling sector .\nWorking with new and emerging technologies, geothermal could generate enough energy to meet 100 percent of Pennsylvania\u2019s electricity, and heating, and low- to medium-temperature industrial process needs in as few as 10 years .\n\u201cPennsylvania has a long and proud history of energy innovation, and my administration is working to cement the Commonwealth\u2019s place as a national energy leader \u2013 working with the energy industry, including organizations like Project Innerspace, to build exciting new technology in Pennsylvania like geothermal, hydrogen, and more,\u201d\n\u201cMy \u2018Lightning Plan\u2019 will spark new innovation and build a more reliable, affordable energy grid by incentivizing new projects, streamlining permitting approvals, and encouraging communities to lower utility bills and improve reliability through shared energy resources. By coming together around commonsense technologies like geothermal, we can support groundbreaking projects, lower costs for consumers, create more jobs, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come.\u201d\n\u201cPennsylvania is an energy leader and an epicenter of oil and gas industry workforce, talent and know-how,\u201d\u201cPennsylvania led the charge historically with the first oil well and in the shale revolution, now it can be at the forefront of the next drilling revolution, but this time around for heat.\u201d\n#### Policies to further push geothermal adoption\nThe Report offers 23 targeted policy recommendations to accelerate the adoption of geothermal energy across Pennsylvania, which could create economic savings for residents, generate long-term job opportunities, reduce emissions, and bolster energy security in the commonwealth.\nThe policy recommendations focus on six areas:\n1. Provide industry with regulatory certainty and eliminate red tape;\n2. Encourage the adoption of ground source heat pumps for building heating and cooling;\n3. Create and expand targeted incentives for direct-use geothermal applications for the industrial and agricultural sectors;\n4. Catalyze the creation of thermal energy networks to serve residential, commercial, academic, and public building;\n5. Advance comprehensive state and regional power market policies that promote clean, firm, flexible power;\n6. Educate stakeholders and create geothermal development strategies.\n![]( recommendations from the Future of Geothermal in Pennsylvania report (source: Project InnerSpace)\n\u201cGeothermal energy is a potentially limitless, always-on power source that could provide clean, locally-sourced electricity to millions of Pennsylvania residents and businesses,\u201d \u201cA thriving, growing, job-creating economy isn\u2019t built on yesterday\u2019s technologies. It\u2019s built on innovation \u2013 on bold investments. Project InnerSpace\u2019s report shows that Pennsylvania can lead the way in this next energy revolution.\u201d\n\u201cPennsylvania can help the United States dominate on energy by ensuring we have a reliable, secure and diverse supply of energy,\u201d\u201cGiven geothermal\u2019s potential to help advance key industries in Pennsylvania like advanced manufacturing and agriculture, I am excited to see this resource be added to Pennsylvania\u2019s prolific energy portfolio.\u201d\n\u201cPennsylvania is a national leader in energy production, and geothermal systems can be the next step in the Commonwealth\u2019s transition to a cleaner, more resilient grid,\u201d\u201cAs electricity demands continue to grow, geothermal can play a crucial role in creating clean energy jobs and lowering utility bills.\u201d\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![SLB and Ormat partner to fast-track development of integrated geothermal assets 27 Oct 2025 SLB and Ormat partner to fast-track development of integrated geothermal assets ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development 27 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![BLM Nevada geothermal lease sale nets over USD 9 million in bids on 86 parcels 23 Oct 2025 BLM Nevada geothermal lease sale nets over USD 9 million in bids on 86 parcels ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program 22 Oct 2025 Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards 17 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program 15 Oct 2025 California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University 2 Oct 2025 PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Turboden to deliver ORC systems for Phase II of Cape Station geothermal project in Utah 2 Oct 2025 Turboden to deliver ORC systems for Phase II of Cape Station geothermal project in Utah ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![XGS Energy completes 3000-hour operations of geothermal technology in Coso, California 30 Sep 2025 XGS Energy completes 3000-hour operations of geothermal technology in Coso, California ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells 25 Sep 2025 Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Quaise holds public demonstration of millimeter wave technology for geothermal drilling 22 Sep 2025 Quaise holds public demonstration of millimeter wave technology for geothermal drilling ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

In addition, extensive geophysical measurements are carried out in the borehole. A pumping test is intended to provide information on water permeability. The drilling data is representative of the region, will be presented to the public and will then be freely accessible. The drilling in Krefeld is a pure research drilling to explore the limestone in the subsurface.\nThe drilling is intended to penetrate the limestone of the so-called carbonate limestone completely. The experts suspect that the geological formation at the drilling point is between 400 and 700 meters deep.\n\u201cEven if the carbonate limestone is deeper than expected, with a drilling depth of 1,000 meters we have enough leeway to drill through its entire thickness,\u201d\n\u201cAs soon as we have drilled through the limestone layer and come across the sandstone underneath, we will stop drilling.\u201d\n#### Minimizing community impact\nThe preparation of the drilling site, the drilling work, the subsequent investigations in the borehole, its professional backfilling and the dismantling of the drilling rig will take a total of around five months. During this period, the rear parking lot of the town hall on Konrad-Adenauer-Platz\/Girmesgath will be partially closed. Once the work is completed, the parking lot will be returned to its original state and will therefore be fully usable again.\n\u201cWe planned the drilling so that residents are affected as little as possible and there are still enough parking spaces available,\u201d\nGroundwater protection is also guaranteed, as the drilling site is being designed in such a way that substances that are hazardous to water, such as machine oil, cannot get into the subsoil and surrounding waters. For this reason, the borehole is also lined with cement on the inside. The use of environmentally friendly drilling fluids and the professional disposal of the deep water extracted were also prerequisites for the granting of the drilling permit.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![\u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 28 Oct 2025 \u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Utilizing the geothermal resource at 1300 meters depth, the plant will supply heat to the district heating system to provide 15% of the heating needs of Schwerin, or equivalent to 2000 households.\nAn inauguration ceremony for the Schwerin geothermal plant was held in April 2023. However, problems were encountered due to the presence of suspended particles in the fluids, likely from the sandstone formation. Thus, filters had to be designed and installed to ensure that the fluid entering the heat exchangers meets the requirement for the equipment.\nAnother problem then came up with the formation of bacteria that clogged the pipes, which again had to be flushed at the end of August. This caused the second target operations date of June 2024 to be missed again.\nWith commissioning currently ongoing, more and more warm brine is now being extracted from the borehole and pumped back. The heat pumps will then be put into operation in the next few weeks to start supplying geothermal heat to the local district heating network.

Technology\n# New study presents updated geothermal drilling cost curves\n!New study presents updated geothermal drilling cost curves Sandia National Laboratories mechanical engineer Melanie Schneider holds a polycrystalline diamond compact bit. Despite decades of research at Sandia and elsewhere, only recently have such bits become viable for geothermal well drilling. (source: Craig Fritz \/ Sandia National Laboratories)\n![ ](\n![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 27 Mar 2025\nA study published by Akindipe and Witter presents a new geothermal drilling cost curve based on drilling performance by Fervo Energy, Utah FORGE, and GPC.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nA study presented by Dayo Akindipe and Erik Witter from the\n#### Recent projects set new industry-leading drilling rates\nThe study updates the Well Cost Simplified (WCS) model initially produced in Sandia (Lowry et al, 2017) and updated in 2022 by NREL.\nThe paper cites four specific projects in setting a new baseline for geothermal drilling performance. These include the Project Red and Cape Station projects of Fervo Energy, the drilling of the 16(B)78-32 production well by Utah FORGE, and the drilling of the GD-36 well by the Geysers Power Company (GPC).\nThese projects were considered to have recorded remarkable improvements in rates of penetration in hard rock, which have translated into industry-leading drilling rates. Drilling performance improvements have been driven by the increased use of polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits, inter-\/intraproject learning (El-Sadi et al. 2024), and technology transfer from the oil and gas industry, including the implementation of the physics-based rate limiter redesign technique (Dupriest and Noynaert 2022, 2024) and multiwell pad drilling (Norbeck et al. 2024).\n#### Updated drilling performance assumptions\nBased on the successes of the cited projects, the study proposes updated parameters that can be used as assumptions for the baseline drilling cost curve. For instance, an average ROP of 75 ft\/hr was proposed, which is a significant improvement from the 25 ft\/hr average of the original 2017 model.\nNew technologies have also allowed for higher casing running speeds, resulting in an average of 800 feet\/hour or 20 joints\/hour. There is some expected variation based on casing size and the familiarity of the drilling personnel. However, the assumed average improves on the 300 feet\/hour average of the original model.\nWith PDC bits now being the typical bit of choice for hard rock drilling, the bit cost multiplier has been increased from 1 to 2 for the updated drilling cost curve. The original 2017 model assumed that all rotary drilling will be done using roller cone bits. There is some expected variation based on bit size and whether the bit can be repaired after the bit run.\nAn average bit life of 50 hours was assumed for the new cost curve, which is the same assumption made by the old models. The previous figure was retained as all case study projects reported that the bits were pulled out before significant wear had occurred. This means that bit life is more of an optimization variable, rather than a hard technical limit.\nFinally, a lower contingency factor was applied to the new drilling cost curve. The authors argue that improvements in drilling efficiency and advances in MWD\/LWD tools means there will be less trouble time and\/or nonproductive time. Thus, a reduction of the contingency factor from 15% to 10% was implemented.\n#### Cost reduction for both vertical and horizontal wells\nBased on the drilling data and corresponding assumptions, the authors generated new geothermal drilling cost curves. Several curves were presented, representing both horizontal and vertical drilling of both small-diameter and large-diameter wells.\nIn summary, the revised drilling curves indicate that drilling costs have decreased from the 2017 baseline by 12% to 24% for vertical wells and 18% to 26% for horizontal wells.\nThe results of the study justifies the need to update the baseline drilling cost curves used by models that estimate the costs of geothermal power such as the Geothermal Electricity Technology Evaluation Model (GETEM) and the System Advisor Model (SAM). Incorporating the revised curves will improve the accuracy of geothermal cost estimation in these models and corresponding derivative analyses, such as resource supply curves evaluation, capacity expansion modeling, and workforce development assessment.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards 23 Oct 2025 Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Arup 13 Oct 2025 Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Aru ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress 10 Oct 2025 Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya 6 Oct 2025 Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa 2 Oct 2025 The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels 24 Sep 2025 Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France 18 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! 17 Sep 2025 One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest 15 Sep 2025 Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees 12 Sep 2025 Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

This unique approach offers pathways for traditional college students as well as adult and working learners interested in careers in the geothermal energy industry.\n\u201cThousands of Americans work in upstream oil and gas, and with the right tools, they can easily apply their skill sets to geothermal production,\u201d\n\u201cWe can harness the full potential of this existing talent pool and attract new talent beyond current fossil fuel workers by providing on-the-ground and in-classroom training opportunities. We believe that our apprenticeship program with SUU can ignite that process, supporting local job growth across Southwest Utah.\u201d\nJust recently, Fervo Energy received the approval from the Bureau of Land Management for the Fervo Cape Geothermal Power Project, an Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) project that is aiming for a total installed capacity of 2 GW.\nAlready, 22 individuals working with ten different oilfield service providers operating in the area have registered for the geothermal apprenticeship program. By the end of 2024, the program aims to enroll at least 40 apprentices, providing them with an opportunity to fill an immediate workforce need upon completion of the apprenticeship.\n\u201cSouthwest Utah has the resource potential to become a national clean energy hub, and we have the human potential to make that vision a reality,\u201dOur new apprenticeship program will prepare Utahns to drive much-needed energy innovation in the communities they call home.\u201d\nFunding from Elemental Impact, a nonprofit investor in climate technology and community focused initiatives, enabled Fervo to offer this workforce training program.\n\u201cDemand for electricity is surging and expected to double in the US by 2030; geothermal sources, like those being deployed by Fervo, have the potential to meet that demand while boosting local jobs,\u201d\n\u201cWe are thrilled to support this geothermal apprenticeship program and help power the transfer of valuable skills from oil and gas professionals to the geothermal industry.

This process will take place simultaneously with the construction of Vulcan\u2019s Phase One commercial plant.\nPhase One of the project, designated Lionheart, will supply approximately 24,000 tonnes per annum of lithium hydroxide, enough for approximately 500,000 electric vehicles (EVs) per annum\nThe CLEOP facility complements Vulcan\u2019s upstream Lithium Extraction Optimization Plant (LEOP) in Landau, which was officially opened in late 2023. The LEOP is where lithium chloride is produced from geothermal brine using the company\u2019s Adsorption-type Direct Lithium Extraction (A-DLE) technology.\nThe Company\u2019s Phase One upstream and downstream plants will exclude fossil fuels in both the extraction and processing of lithium. This makes Vulcan\u2019s supply chain one of the lowest cost and lowest carbon footprint for lithium production globally. The Phase One process will also involve the co-production of heat and power from geothermal resource, the excess of which can be supplied to local communities.\nRecently, Vulcan\u2019s operations were assigned Dark Green by S&P Global Ratings, the highest ever received by a Metals and Mining company globally. S&P Global Ratings\u2019 methodology includes six shades, with a Dark Green rating awarded to activities that correspond to the long-term vision of the low-carbon climate resilient future\nSource: Email correspondence\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The company had announced plans to start drilling earlier this year, but these were halted pending the decision on the license extension request.\nCindrigo cites several reasons for their decision to exit the Croatian geothermal market, among these the \u201clicensing delays and the lack of transparency from the Croatian Hydrocarbon Agency\u201d and a higher expected output from their German prospects.\nThe company\u2019s withdrawal from Slatina 3 also terminated its loan agreements with Petroline LLC and Tri Ri Asset Management.\n#### Expiration of license terms and potential new co-owner\nAccording to Croatia\u2019s Ministry of Economy, the decision to not extend the exploration license was due to Cindrigo already receiving the maximum number of license extensions. The developer was also cited as not meeting the deadlines for drilling, and that the concession had rightfully expired as of April 2024.\nDocumentation submitted to the Zagreb Commercial Court indicates that Cindrigo had initiated bankruptcy proceedings at Dravacel. However, the documents also show that Swedish corporation Danir AB holds a 49.1% stake in Cindrigo Geothermal Ltd. as part of a loan agreement for \u00a34.5 million. The new ownership framework for Dravacel will likely be clarified once the bankruptcy proceedings are completed. Prior to Cindrigo\u2019s acquisition, 100% ownership of Dravacel was with entrepreneur Marinko Mikuli?.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The aim is to provide a transparent, transferable, and reusable guideline for assessing and quantifying the geological probability of success and natural geological variability. The guideline has been written primarily for the German market and similar low-enthalpy regions.\nSuch a geological assessment is essential for the responsible and economical use of investments and subsidies. Quantifying the geological probability of success is the necessary basis for or against investment decisions. In addition, the proposed assessment approach enables a traceable forecast of the range of possible geological scenarios and their probability of occurrence. This creates the necessary basis for a proper subsurface and surface planning and realistic cost estimates.\nThis guideline primarily focuses on hydrothermal systems with several boreholes that are to be drilled deeper than 400 metres. The feasibility and economic viability of geothermal systems are analysed, where thermal water flows not only through the boreholes and surface facility but also through the subsurface geological formations.\nThe final version has been extensively revised compared to the gray print of April 2024. The BVEG would like to thank all the geothermal operators, authorities, engineering service providers, private individuals and ministries, that provided constructive suggestions that were intensively discussed and incorporated into the guide.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Today\u2019s announcement reinforces the Department of Energy\u2019s commitment to strengthening the nation\u2019s manufacturing competitiveness and ensuring the country\u2019s energy future is built by Americans, for Americans.\nThe company had previously signed a binding lithium supply contract with Ford Motor Company for sustainably produced lithium hydroxide.\n#### About Project ATLiS\nThe facility is expected to produce up to 20,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide annually, enough for approximately 52 GWh of lithium-ion batteries per year.\nThe ATLiS facility will use a technology called direct lithium extraction (DLE) to recover lithium from Salton Sea geothermal brine. DLE technologies are applicable in many lithium brine and clay resources across the United States, allowing economically competitive extraction where impurities or lower lithium concentrations would otherwise limit commercial opportunities. DLE also requires less water and land versus conventional extraction methods from brines, such as evaporation ponds.\nProject ATLiS will be the first facility to utilize the process at commercial scale in the United States. ATLiS will deploy a proprietary DLE technology called ILiAD\u2122 (developed by ESM ILiAD LLC, another EnergySource Minerals subsidiary) for lithium recovery, which has been piloted with various brine resources across the United States and internationally, including in Utah, Texas, and Nevada, in addition to onsite in California.\n![]( diagram of the lithium extraction process of EnergySource Minerals (source: EnergySource Minerals)\nThe facility will be sited next to an existing geothermal plant, which will supply the lithium-rich brine from the subsurface geothermal field located over one mile underground. After impurities are removed from the brine, the lithium will be separated out using the ILiAD\u2122 DLE technology.\nThe lithium-depleted brine will be returned to the geothermal plant for reinjection into the geothermal reservoir, and the lithium will be further purified, crystallized, and packaged into battery-grade material. The brine features additional recoverable critical minerals supporting America\u2019s industrial base, including zinc and manganese, which ATLiS expects to extract and commercialize.\nPrior DOE analysis has estimated that potential lithium production from the Salton Sea known geothermal resource area may exceed 4 million metric tons, which can produce over 10,000 GWh of battery capacity. This project supports the Administration\u2019s efforts to strengthen supply chains that are key to national energy security, reduce reliance on economic competitors like China, and unlock America\u2019s tremendous domestic lithium resource\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program 22 Oct 2025 Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya 6 Oct 2025 Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![T\u00fcrkiye hosts German delegation to showcase geothermal expertise, technology, and development 2 Oct 2025 T\u00fcrkiye hosts German delegation to showcase geothermal expertise, technology, and development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Cornish Lithium raises \u00a335m equity funding to advance UK lithium and geothermal projects 29 Sep 2025 Cornish Lithium raises \u00a335m equity funding to advance UK lithium and geothermal projects ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Project InnerSpace launches geothermal cold storage project in India under funding program 25 Sep 2025 Project InnerSpace launches geothermal cold storage project in India under funding program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First Gen \\(EDC\\) ventures into Indonesia with geothermal investment strategy 24 Sep 2025 First Gen (EDC) ventures into Indonesia with geothermal investment strategy ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Startup developing CO2-based geothermal system completes seed funding round 23 Sep 2025 Startup developing CO2-based geothermal system completes seed funding round ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lithium de France secures \u20ac40 million funding for pre-industrial phase of geothermal lithium project 23 Sep 2025 Lithium de France secures \u20ac40 million funding for pre-industrial phase of geothermal lithium proje ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Altamin secures grant for research on critical minerals from geothermal brine in Italy 22 Sep 2025 Altamin secures grant for research on critical minerals from geothermal brine in Italy ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

This can include the drilling of wells to confirm the existence of a geothermal resources (including core drilling and temperature gradient wells), to improve injection support, or to demonstrate the connections between wells.\nUnder current regulations, geothermal developers must conduct two separate environmental reviews: one for initial exploration drilling and another to fully test the geothermal resource, even if both have similar environmental impacts. The proposal would apply only to geothermal resource confirmation operations on public lands and split estates. Further geothermal development would still require additional environmental analysis. Based on previous DOE analysis, these permitting actions could significantly reduce permitting timelines and capital costs of geothermal deployment.\nUnder the National Environmental Policy Act,?categorical exclusions (CXs)?are categories of actions that typically do not have significant impacts on the human environment. When used appropriately, CXs eliminate the need for an environmental assessment (EA) as part of the permitting process. CXs cannot be applied in cases with special circumstances, such as potential impacts to endangered species, in which case an EA must still be conducted.\nThe proposal will be published in the Federal Register in the coming days to begin a 30-day public comment period.\n#### Responsible geothermal development on public lands\nThese announcement follow the recent BLM Nevada State Office\u2019s geothermal lease sale which saw healthy interest from private investors making it the most successful sale since 2008 and the second-most ever. The BLM sold 64 parcels covering nearly 218,000 acres, bringing in over $7.8 million in high bids. This marks a sharp increase from the previous year\u2019s sale of 96,600 acres for just over $1 million, demonstrating the growing interest in geothermal development on public lands.\n\u201cGeothermal energy is one of our greatest untapped clean energy resources on public lands,\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s actions are part of the Department\u2019s work to deliver on new opportunities, new technologies, and new solutions in geothermal energy that support the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s commitment to create jobs, economic growth, and clean carbon-free electricity for communities throughout the West.\u201d\n\u201cThe BLM is committed to supporting the responsible growth of geothermal energy on public lands,\u201d\u201cWe need all the tools in the toolbox to reach a clean energy future, and this proposed categorical exclusion will be helpful in accelerating the process of locating new geothermal resources.\u201d\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards 23 Oct 2025 Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Arup 13 Oct 2025 Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Aru ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress 10 Oct 2025 Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya 6 Oct 2025 Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa 2 Oct 2025 The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels 24 Sep 2025 Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France 18 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! 17 Sep 2025 One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest 15 Sep 2025 Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees 12 Sep 2025 Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

We had previously reported on in early 2024 an update on the drilling progress of Eavor, simultaneous with the power plant construction. By the end of 2024, the total measured depth of drilling had reached 8000 meters.\nLand provides some details on how Eavor changed their drilling approach for the project. The initial plan was to drill two wells vertically to depths of 4500 meters before drilling horizontally for 3000 to 3500 meters to form a loop. This process will then be repeated to create twelve loops.\nHowever, Eavor is now planning to create only six loops on Loop 1, as this is the number necessary to operate the power plant. Three loops have already been finished and drilling of the fourth loop is ongoing. The company also decided to pressure test each loop immediately upon completion of drilling.\nAlthough the new approach presented some challenges, it also provided valuable learning experience for Eavor. Land describes the delays as \u201cpart of the learning curve\u201d\nDrilling work at the Geretsried site started in mid-2023. The goal for the site is to generate approximately 64 MW of thermal output or 8.2 MW of electrical output, thus saving approximately 44,000 tons of CO2 equivalent per year. The project has received a great deal of financial and political support, becoming the first recipient of the Canada Growth Fund and securing financing of over EUR 130 million in early 2024.\nEavor managing director Daniel M\u00f6lk emphasizes that what the company is doing in Geretsried has never been done before. \u201cWe were extremely happy when we successfully joined the first two laterals into a loop with a drilled length of around 8,000 meters.\u201d\nEavor has since secured agreements for similar geothermal projects in the German cities of Hanover and Neu-Ulm.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

But due to over development, the steam pressure from those reservoirs began to decline in the 1980s. The future of the power generation was threatened, so an innovative solution was needed.\nWastewater from Lake County was identified as a solution and construction of the Southeast Geysers Effluent Pipeline began in 1995, with delivery of recycled water to The Geysers commencing in 1997. The 40-mile pipeline delivers approximately 8 million gallons of recycled water daily to The Geysers for reinjection into the reservoir, helping maintain steam pressure. Partnership on the Santa Rosa Geysers Recharge Project followed and today, these two projects provide up to 20 million gallons of reclaimed water daily, replenishing the reservoir.\n#### Modeling decades\u2019 worth of subsurface data\nSeequent\u2019s software allows Calpine to consolidate all aboveground and subsurface data collected through the decades into a model that informs reservoir management and the planning of future wells. \u201cWe have hundreds of active geothermal wells and dozens of active water reinjection wells. It allows us to render the surface data, the subsurface data, and the position of all the different geothermal wells,\u201d\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re planning new water injection wells, we really have to understand where that water is going to go in the subsurface, and the software really allows us to visualize in great detail and at high accuracy.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the software tools of Bentley, Seequent\u2019s parent company, allows for modeling of the above-ground component of pumping recycled water for reinjection into the Geysers field.\n#### Engineering solutions for sustainability goals\nSeequent has been selected as an official partner of the UNESCO World Engineering Day for Sustainable Development (WED) 2025, which celebrates the contributions of the engineering profession in pursuit of the United Nations\u2019 sustainable development goals. The video on the Geysers geothermal field is part of a year-long campaign of events, films, and related articles highlighting engineering achievements in the field of sustainable development.\nThe campaign aims to act as a springboard for governments, UN-associated organisations, policymakers, educators and leaders in the public and private sectors to raise awareness of the importance of engineering.\n_\u201cSeequent is honoured to be a partner for World Engineering Day 2025._ Engineers play a crucial role in enhancing our lives and our interaction with the planet.

The agreement was signed by Gu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson, Minister of the Environment, Energy and Climate, and Stefano Nicoletti , Italy\u2019s ambassador to Iceland, on behalf of Italy\u2019s Minister of Energy.\nGu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r said at the signing that it was appropriate and timely that the two countries with the longest history and most knowledge in the field of using geothermal energy in Europe signed an agreement on cooperation in that field.\nNicoletti said there are many similarities in the use of geothermal energy in the two states. The Italians had built their first geothermal plant in 1905 and had a lot of experience and knowledge. They also shared their knowledge with other countries like Iceland. The agreement that has now been signed is a new beginning of closer cooperation, where it is important to bring experts and the private sector to the table.\nGeothermal energy is an underutilized renewable resource in Europe and globally, and there are sometimes unnecessary regulatory barriers to its use, often due to ignorance. In the fight against climate change, the use of geothermal energy should be welcomed, but no thresholds should be set. The relationship between Iceland and Italy would be good, and cooperation in geothermal matters would improve it even more.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

PLN NTT is a division of Indonesia\u2019s state-owned electric utility company, PT PLN (Persero). This unit is responsible for managing electricity generation, distribution, and infrastructure development in the East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) region. East Nusa Tenggara is the southernmost province of Indonesia. It comprises the eastern portion of the Lesser Sunda Islands, facing the Indian Ocean in the south and the Flores Sea in the north\nAt an event yesterday, PLN Electricity System Planning Manager I Wayan Adi Hari emphasized that achieving this target will require collaboration with international partners and advancements in supporting technologies.\nGeothermal as the Primary Renewable Energy Source\nNTT\u2019s renewable energy mix was projected to reach 17.8% in 2023 and 23% in 2024, but current figures indicate that only 10% of the region\u2019s total 470 MW power capacity comes from renewables.\nExisting Renewable Energy in NTT (as of 2023): 50 solar power plants (PLTS) \u2013 19.2 MW, 9 micro-hydro plants (PLTMH) \u2013 6.77 MW, 3 geothermal power plants (PLTP) \u2013 20.5 MW.\nGiven geothermal\u2019s higher capacity output, PLN NTT plans to prioritize PLTP development to increase the renewable energy ratio. Flores, which once achieved a 26% renewable energy mix, serves as a key geothermal hub for the region.\nPlanned Geothermal Power Plants\nTo meet the 23% renewable energy target, PLN NTT is developing several new geothermal power plants, including:\n* Ulumbu PLTP \u2013 20 MW\n* Sokoria PLTP \u2013 25 MW\n* Mataloko PLTP \u2013 20 MW\n* Atadei PLTP \u2013 10 MW\nHowever, permitting, community engagement, and infrastructure challenges remain obstacles to large-scale geothermal development.\nAddressing Electrification Challenges in NTT\nNTT\u2019s electrification ratio has reached 96.37% as of January 2025, but four regions remain in the \u201cred zone\u201d with limited access to electricity: Sabu Raijua, South Central Timor, East Manggarai, Southwest Sumba. Additionally, 35 villages in East Sumba still lack electricity due to their remote locations and limited grid expansion.\nA Collaborative Effort for Sustainable Energy\nWith strong government and international support, PLN NTT aims to expand geothermal energy production, enhance rural electrification, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.\nGeothermal development in Flores and surrounding areas could play a crucial role in achieving Indonesia\u2019s renewable energy goals while providing sustainable power solutions for future generations.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Geothermal research drilling in Strandeiland, Netherlands reaches target 1963m depth 15 Oct 2025 Geothermal research drilling in Strandeiland, Netherlands reaches target 1963m depth ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Chemicals is closer to the geothermal sector with new office in Izmir, T\u00fcrkiye 5 Sep 2025 Green Chemicals is closer to the geothermal sector with new office in Izmir, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Government backs geothermal project in Chinameca, El Salvador 5 Jun 2025 Government backs geothermal project in Chinameca, El Salvador ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Bill Gates highlights Fervo Energy\u2019s geothermal innovation 3 Jun 2025 Bill Gates highlights Fervo Energy\u2019s geothermal innovation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Bog\u00e1cs, Hungary implements networked geothermal heating system from spa water 23 Apr 2025 Bog\u00e1cs, Hungary implements networked geothermal heating system from spa water ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![World Bank announces $150 million investment for geothermal in El Salvador 31 Mar 2025 World Bank announces $150 million investment for geothermal in El Salvador ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![PLN NTT targets 198 MW development with geothermal focus 13 Mar 2025 PLN NTT targets 198 MW development with geothermal focus ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![MOU to push geothermal development in Sintiki, Greece 23 Jan 2025 MOU to push geothermal development in Sintiki, Greece ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Seismic survey for geothermal exploration to commence in Lucerne, Switzerland 8 Jan 2025 Seismic survey for geothermal exploration to commence in Lucerne, Switzerland ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Funding agreement signed for geothermal drilling in Jelenia Gora, Poland 3 Dec 2024 Funding agreement signed for geothermal drilling in Jelenia Gora, Poland ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Novel borehole heat exchanger design developed by ITACA researchers 29 Oct 2024 Novel borehole heat exchanger design developed by ITACA researchers ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling to start for geothermal greenhouse project in Simav, K\u00fctahya, T\u00fcrkiye 10 Oct 2024 Drilling to start for geothermal greenhouse project in Simav, K\u00fctahya, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The partnership with Quaise explores the possibility of utilizing deep geothermal energy, further reducing the power plant\u2019s fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\nThe partnership underscores the unique capabilities of deep geothermal to decarbonize heavy industrial sectors like mining, and marks the first commercial pilot for retrofitting a fossil fuel power plant to accommodate geothermal heat. This is well aligned with NGM\u2019s 2030 GHG reduction roadmap targets. NGM had also just recently completed the construction of a 200-MW solar power plant.\n\u201cNevada Gold Mines is targeting an overall 30% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030,\u201d\u201cWe continue to pursue initiatives that economically reduce our reliance on carbon-based electricity sources. Quaise offers a unique prospective solution to hybridize our on-site power generation with clean geothermal heat.\u201d\n#### Decarbonizing the mining sector with deep geothermal\nThe partnership highlights two key reasons why going deeper is a necessity for geothermal to achieve a significant share of the global energy mix by 2050. The first is location. Deep geothermal wells can be drilled in more places around the world, even next to existing power plants. The second is economics. Deep geothermal can compete with fossil fuels on cost while eliminating carbon emissions by producing as much as 10x more power per well than traditional geothermal.\n\u201cDeep geothermal can decarbonize critical industrial processes like mining because of its superior power density,\u201d\u201cOur millimeter wave drilling technology is the key to unlocking high-grade geothermal heat, repositioning fossil-fired assets for a clean energy future.\u201d\nAn excellent example of deep geothermal helping to reduce the carbon footprint of mining operations is in the Lihir Island of Papua New Guinea where a geothermal power plant has been operating since 2001. Several similar projects are being evaluated elsewhere, including in Toka Tindung in Sulawesi, Indonesia, and in the Colluli mining project in Eritrea.\nThe retrofit of NGM\u2019s TS Power Plant positions Quaise to go from drilling field trials to full commercial deployment.

This initiative, announced by Minister of the Environment, Energy, and Climate, J\u00f3hann P\u00e1ll J\u00f3hannsson in a meeting today, is a key step toward enhancing energy security, reducing costs, and maximizing Iceland\u2019s geothermal potential.\nAddressing energy gaps in cold regions\nDespite Iceland\u2019s reputation as a global leader in geothermal energy, around 10% of households remain disconnected from geothermal district heating. The new exploration program aims to bridge this gap by identifying and developing new geothermal resources in regions where geothermal has been underutilized. We reported on more recent efforts in the Westfjords of Iceland, but also in the East in H\u00f6fn.\nEconomic benefits of geothermal expansion\nA recent report commissioned by the Icelandic Ministry of the Environment, Energy, and Climate suggests that enhancing geothermal utilization could generate up to ISK 8 billion (USD 58 million) in annual economic benefits. This would come from:\n* Lower heating costs for homes and businesses.\n* Reduced reliance on fossil fuels and electricity subsidies.\n* Increased energy independence through expanded geothermal district heating.\n\u201cBy optimizing geothermal utilization, we can strengthen energy security, reduce costs, and enhance environmental sustainability,\u201d said Minister J\u00f3hannsson.\nGovernment and industry collaboration\nThe initiative has gained strong political and industry support, with remarks at the launch event from \u00cdris R\u00f3bertsd\u00f3ttir, Mayor of Vestmannaeyjar and Vilhj\u00e1lmur Hilmarsson, Chairman of the Icelandic Climate and Energy Fund\nThe event w liveasstreamed on the Icelandic government\u2019s website, allowing the public to follow the discussion on expanding Iceland\u2019s geothermal footprint.\nA strategic move for Iceland\u2019s energy future\nThe government\u2019s geothermal push aligns with Iceland\u2019s broader renewable energy goals, which include:\n* Expanding district heating in remote areas.\n* Investing in new geothermal research and drilling projects.\n* Ensuring long-term sustainability and cost efficiency in Iceland\u2019s heating system.\nWith continued investment in geothermal energy, Iceland is taking concrete steps toward a more resilient, sustainable energy future\u2014one that benefits both local communities and the national economy.\nThe event was be streamed live and a recording (Icelandic) is available on the\nSource:\nNote: This article was adapted to now include the details shared in the meeting.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The geothermal district heating system of Beius currently supplies 70% of its population, but the local governments seeks to expand this to 100% coverage.\nThe project \u201cTechnical Development of the District Heating System\u201d in Beius was conducted by the National Energy Authority of Iceland together with UAT Beius, with funding from Innovation Norway from the European Economic Area (EEA) and Norwegian grants.\nThe results of the study was presented recently at meeting attended by the Mayor of Beius, representatives from the\nBaldur Petursson from the Icelandic Environment and Energy Agency stated that there was potential for further development of geothermal in Beius to benefit from EEA subsidies. Further, Horia Ban of the Romanian Geoexchange Society presented complementary projects on heat recovery from spent geothermal brine, which can still be extracted and upgraded using heat pumps. This can be used for industrial and agricultural applications, such as greenhouses, wood drying, and fish farming.\nAnother important conclusion of the study is that heat losses in the district heating system can be minimized by using specialized material, such as pre-insulated PE-Xa pipes.\nA geothermal well drilled to a depth of 2600 meters in 1996 tapped a high-flow reservoir with a temperature of 85 \u00b0C. This jumpstarted the use of geothermal for heating in Beius, supplying affordable and sustainable heat to apartment blocks, hospitals, nurseries, kindergartens, and other public institutions. A second well was drilled in 2004, and a third in 2010. Today, Beius is the city with the cheapest heating costs in Romania.\nWhile Western Romania already has extensive history in geothermal utilization, the capital of Bucharest has also undertaken studies to evaluate the feasibility of geothermal heating. In 2024, an agreement was signed between the local utility company ELCEN and the US Department of Energy to jointly study the potential for geothermal heating in Bucharest. Another similar agreement was signed later in 2024 for a similar study with Sage Geosystems, in partnership with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![\u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 28 Oct 2025 \u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The construction was supported by funding from the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management (NFOSiGW). Of the PLN 67 million total investment for the project, PLN 26 million in funding and another loan of PLN 18 million came from the NFOSiGW. The local government then contributed PLN 4 million. The rest of the money from MPEC Konin.\nTo start with the operations of the heating plant, the heating company is still waiting on two documents \u2013 the environmental decision for exploitation of the geothermal resource from the Regional Directorate for Environmental Protection in Poznan, as well as the concession for heat generation from the Energy Regulatory Office.\nMPEC Konin had also submitted documents for the procedures for new heat tariffs, although the above-mentioned decisions will still be needed to supplement the application. In any case, the share of the new geothermal heating plant is not expected to have a new impact on the tariffs. Geothermal will account for only 5-10% of the heat supply in Konin, with the rest coming from biomass and waste incineration.\nThe company president states that some of the documents can only be completed once construction has finished. \u201cThis is an administrative procedure lasting several months, conditioned by certain deadlines. We are trying to work on certain documents in parallel, but we will not change the procedure.

The GEOBUILD programme is funded by the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) with finance from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the European Union Caribbean Investment Facility (EU-CIF) through CDB\u2019s GeoSmart Initiative. The programme seeks to harness the region\u2019s geothermal potential to provide sustainable energy solutions, reduce dependence on fossil fuels, and promote economic resilience.\n\u201cThe partnership with IRENA represents a pivotal step forward in our efforts to develop geothermal energy in the OECS. By fostering a robust stakeholder engagement, we can ensure that the voices of our communities are heard and that their needs are integrated into our energy strategies,\u201d\n#### Improving geothermal stakeholder engagement\nBy working closely with IRENA, the OECS Commission aims to engage local communities, government officials, and private stakeholders about the benefits and opportunities associated with geothermal energy development which could transform economies and heighten energy independence and security in the OECS.\nIn late 2023, the GEOBUILD programme held a workshop in Grenada to provide training in communicating about geothermal energy, with emphasis on how geothermal can be used for direct applications that can create economic and social opportunities for member states.\nThe programme also held a study tour for representatives from Eastern Caribbean countries to the ongoing geothermal project in Dominica. Building on the success of Guadeloupe, which has been generating geothermal power since 1986 and is expanding its capacity, Dominica is set to make history as the first geothermal power station in the English-speaking OECS and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) by late 2025.\n![]( testing of RV-P2 production well at Roseau Valley, Dominica geothermal project (source: YouTube screenshot, DGDC)\n#### Promoting inclusive community involvement\nIRENA\u2019s involvement will provide technical expertise and best practices to support the OECS in fostering effective stakeholder engagement, ensuring diverse perspectives are integrated into decision-making processes. This partnership reflects IRENA\u2019s commitment to supporting Small Island Developing States in their transition to renewable energy sources and facilitating inclusive dialogues that drive sustainable development.\n\u201cBy harnessing the power of collaboration, we aim to ensure local priorities are at the heart of these efforts, building capacity, strengthening resilience, and delivering sustainable energy solutions that secure a more sustainable and prosperous future for OECS Member States,\u201d\nThe project fosters inclusive community involvement, empowering local villages near geothermal sites to actively engage in decision-making processes and voice their concerns. Additionally, it focuses on capacity building by equipping stakeholders with essential knowledge and skills. This approach not only builds local expertise but also ensures that communities are prepared to lead and sustain their energy transitions.\nHarnessing geothermal resources can provide benefits both economically and environmentally. Not only does it provide a clean and renewable energy source with vastly reduced greenhouse gas emissions, but it provides jobs and stimulates economics by supplying energy at lower costs for consumers. These benefits position the OECS member states to advance sustainable energy development while enhancing economic stability and environmental sustainability.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![LATAM Geothermal Congress declares a path forward for the region\u2019s geothermal future 21 Oct 2025 LATAM Geothermal Congress declares a path forward for the region\u2019s geothermal future ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![El Salvador legislation approves Geothermal Energy Law 11 Sep 2025 El Salvador legislation approves Geothermal Energy Law ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![New bill proposes private investment in El Salvador geothermal sector 4 Sep 2025 New bill proposes private investment in El Salvador geothermal sector ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![CDB announces financial close for Dominica geothermal power project 2 Sep 2025 CDB announces financial close for Dominica geothermal power project ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 LATAM Geothermal Congress, El Salvador, 22-25 September 2025 29 Aug 2025 Registration open \u2013 LATAM Geothermal Congress, El Salvador, 22-25 September 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![St Kitts and Nevis receives five bids in geothermal production drilling tender 20 Aug 2025 St Kitts and Nevis receives five bids in geothermal production drilling tender ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Nicaragua revokes Momotombo geothermal concession over money laundering charges 15 Aug 2025 Nicaragua revokes Momotombo geothermal concession over money laundering charges ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![LaGeo celebrates 50 years of Ahuachapan geothermal power station in El Salvador 31 Jul 2025 LaGeo celebrates 50 years of Ahuachapan geothermal power station in El Salvador ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![OECS deliberates acquiring geothermal drill rig to be shared across Caribbean countries 22 Jul 2025 OECS deliberates acquiring geothermal drill rig to be shared across Caribbean countries ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Global Sustainable Islands Summit highlights the geothermal ambitions of Nevis 30 May 2025 Global Sustainable Islands Summit highlights the geothermal ambitions of Nevis ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Grenada plans geothermal exploration drilling by 2026 28 Apr 2025 Grenada plans geothermal exploration drilling by 2026 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dominica reports progress on construction of 10-MW geothermal power plant 23 Apr 2025 Dominica reports progress on construction of 10-MW geothermal power plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

A small-scale prototype involving geothermal loops will also be installed within a number of these foundation piles which will be connected to a prototype geothermal heating system. The goal of this prototype is not to test implementation of district heating at scale but to test and demonstrate a working prototype in real world conditions to investigate feasibility for construction and operation of such a systems. It will also serve as a flagship demonstration of how district heating linked to geostructures can be incorporated into design in new developments in Dublin going forward.\nThe collected data will be used to assess temporal variations in performance against changing climatic and energy demand profiles and to develop numerical models of each system in terms of heat transfer and groundwater flow. These calibrated models will be then used to evaluate potential optimised system configurations to gain more heat from the same footprint. Overall, the results of this study should help to stimulate the somewhat nascent concept of district heating as a realistic future approach to more sustainable energy management in urban areas of Ireland.\nTrinity is Ireland\u2019s leading university and is ranked 87th in the world (QS World University Rankings 2025).

It also aims to simplify regulation, particularly as pertaining to the registry of projects and the issuance of exploration permits. The law also recognized the divers uses of geothermal resources in urban heating, drying of agricultural and industrial products, aquaculture, and food preservation.\nAmong the provisions of the Geothermal Law are the definition of geothermal resources, the process for application for a geothermal exploration permit, the terms of said permit, the process of granting concession rights, and reporting requirements for permit holders. The law introduces a \u201cVarious Uses\u201d permit that pertain to the use of geothermal for applications other than electricity generation.\nRestructuring of agencies\nPart of the energy reform proposal is an integrated structure for the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) and Petroloes Mexicanos (PEMEX). It also eliminates the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) and the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH), transferring their functions instead to the Ministry of Energy. These changes aim to improve regulatory efficiency and strengthening energy planning.\nThe CFE has played the leading role in geothermal development in Mexico, developing and operating the geothermal power facilities of Cerro Prieto, Los Azufres, and Los Humeros.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area 27 Oct 2025 Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program 15 Oct 2025 California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Arup 13 Oct 2025 Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Aru ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brazil approves creation of a National Geothermal Energy Program 1 Oct 2025 Brazil approves creation of a National Geothermal Energy Program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Growing geothermal momentum in focus at the 3rd Budapest Geothermal Energy Summit 30 Sep 2025 Growing geothermal momentum in focus at the 3rd Budapest Geothermal Energy Summit ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells 25 Sep 2025 Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GEOENERG\u00cdA presents proposals for draft Royal Decree on heating and cooling networks in Spain 19 Sep 2025 GEOENERG\u00cdA presents proposals for draft Royal Decree on heating and cooling networks in Spain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![India publishes National Policy setting a framework for geothermal development 17 Sep 2025 India publishes National Policy setting a framework for geothermal development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![El Salvador legislation approves Geothermal Energy Law 11 Sep 2025 El Salvador legislation approves Geothermal Energy Law ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Bringing geothermal in from the margins \u2013 Anne Murrell, Lead of the Geothermal UK Coalition 8 Sep 2025 Bringing geothermal in from the margins \u2013 Anne Murrell, Lead of the Geothermal UK Coalition ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

With this in mind, well testing and hydrodynamic measurements are set to begin for the existing Batina-1 well, located less than 3 kilometers from the potential users of geothermal heat.\nThe Kutina exploration area is located within the Pannonian Basin. The geothermal potential of the area has been well-documented by historical research, with key geological insights provided by oil and gas exploration wells in the region.\nPreliminary investigations have already indicated good potential at the Batina-1 well, but further testing is needed to quantify this potential. The well is particularly interesting as it taps into a potential aquifer within the Kutina Sandstones.\nTo prepare for the well testing program, technical documentation to apply for a permit was headed by the local government with Icelandic partners EFLA hf and the Development Agency MRAV.\nCroatia currently has one operational geothermal power in Velika Ciglena, which officially opened in 2018. Interest for further geothermal development in Croatia has been sustained since then, with multiple wells currently being drilled or in the process of planning and preparation.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Local stress changes illuminated by microseismic focal mechanisms can be used to create maps of high and low stresses which, in turn, can be used to guide a dynamic slurry propagation model and estimate fluid and proppant distribution from the injection.

In this context, our Turkish platform\n### Can you provide information on the current status of geothermal NCG re-injection efforts in T\u00fcrkiye?\nIn recent years, geothermal NCG re-injection efforts in T\u00fcrkiye have gained significant momentum. Particularly in geothermal fields where power plants are prevalent, such as in Aydin and Denizli, numerous projects are being conducted focusing on the re-injection of harmful gases like CO2 and H2S. These efforts aim to reduce the environmental impact of geothermal power plants and increase public acceptance. Leading companies are developing solutions tailored to the field\u2019s production conditions, ensuring the re-injection of NCG into reservoirs and optimizing this process.\nNCG mainly consists of greenhouse gases such as CO2, H2S, and hydrocarbons, which are released into the atmosphere during production. Emissions from geothermal power plants may pose a risk of facing carbon taxes in the future. In recent years, numerous proposals and studies have been conducted on re-injecting NCG into geothermal reservoirs.\n### How did you initiate your studies on NCG re-injection, and what are the most significant findings you have obtained?\nOur studies on re-injecting NCG into geothermal reservoirs began with a TUBITAK research project we launched in 2013. Through this study, we discovered that CO2 and H2S dissolve very easily in water. The solubility of gases in water increases as the temperature decreases. Thus, more NCG can dissolve in re-injected water at lower temperatures. Another factor affecting solubility is pressure. In short, as pressure increases and temperature decreases, more NCG can dissolve in water. Mege A? supported our research project, and the data from the Dora-II geothermal power plant were used in this project.\n![]( 2 GPP (source: Ormat)\nIf the NCG pressure under operating conditions is below the re-injection pressure, it can be increased using a compressor to reach the required solubility pressure. In some cases, the NCG pressure may naturally be higher than the re-injection pressure, making it possible to inject NCG without needing a compressor.\nIn conclusion, it is possible to re-inject all NCG back into the reservoir. However, using compressors can significantly increase internal energy consumption. Therefore, the incentive mechanisms in geothermal energy should be revised, and zero-emission geothermal power plants should be rewarded.\n### We also spoke with Kutlu Cakir, General Manager of Mege Geothermal A.S., about the NCG re-injection processes\u2019 field applications and outcomes.\n### Mr. Kutlu, could you tell us about your field applications and the results of the NCG re-injection processes at Mege Geothermal AS?\nVelika GPP, is the world\u2019s first geothermal power plant to generate electricity by converting old oil wells into production wells.\nMege AS was the first in T\u00fcrkiye to start NCG re-injection without compressors. We are pleased that this practice has recently become widespread in other fields. Mege A? has an installed capacity of 80 MW with five Binary geothermal power plants in the Aydin Salavatli geothermal field.\nThe first geothermal power plant on the site, Dora-I, was commissioned in 2006 with a capacity of 7.95 MW. Although the highest temperature in the field is 213\u00b0C, the production wells of the power plants have an average production temperature of 160-180\u00b0C. Initially, the NCG content of the produced fluid was 1.5% by mass, but it has gradually decreased to an average of 0.5%. The reduced amount of NCG has made re-injection easier.\n### What are your future goals?\nThe NCG re-injection efforts at Mege Geothermal AS have yielded positive results. All NCG is re-injected into the reservoir at Dora-I, Dora-II, and Dora-IIIA units. The NCG collected from emission points at 7-8 bar pressure is connected to the re-injection line using stainless steel pipes. Since the re-injection wells operate at low pressure, all NCG is re-injected into the reservoir with the water.\nThe application has been ongoing for over a year at Dora-II and Dora-IIIA units, and T\u00dcBITAK has certified the absence of NCG emissions based on on-site measurements. At Dora-I, NCG re-injection has been ongoing for a few months. We have also started a new project to re-inject approximately half of the NCG into Dora-IIIB. We aim to achieve 100% NCG re-injection across all our geothermal power plants.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Technology\n# Xiong\u2019An New Area, China records steady growth of geothermal heating\n!Xiong\u2019An New Area, China records steady growth of geothermal heating Government of Xiong'an New Area, Xiong'an, Hebei, China (source:\n![ ](\n![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 2 Apr 2025\nEight years after its establishment, the Xiong'an New Area in Hebei,China has developed geothermal heating covering 12 million square meters of floor area.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nThe geothermal heating capacity in the Xiong\u2019An New Area in Hebei, China has now grown to 12 million square meters on the 8th year anniversary of its establishment. This corresponds to about 27% of the floor area of the newly constructed zones in Xiong\u2019An, and this number is expected to increase to 30% by next year.\nAssuming an average household size of 42 square meters, this means that geothermal is providing heating to about 285,000 households in the Xiong\u2019An New Area.\nWe had reported on the early years of development of the Xiong\u2019An New Area back in 2019.\n#### Strict regulations for sustainability\nThe geothermal resources in Xiong\u2019An had already been documented in the 1970s during drilling for oil exploitation, as explained by Hu Wenjin, deputy general manager of China Xiongan Group Smart Energy Co. The resources were then quickly utilized for hot springs baths and heating. However, the lack of any regulation at the time meant that excessive exploitation resulted in the decline of the geothermal resources and ground subsidence.\nHu explained that, once the New Area was established eight years ago, a strict principle was implemented \u2013 the amount of geothermal water to be extracted is determined by the volume that is reinjected, thus ensuring a balance between production and reinjection. Xiong\u2019An New Area has managed to achieve sustainable extraction of geothermal energy and avoided the issues that happened in the past.\n#### A hybrid system\nSince the New Area\u2019s establishment eight years ago, 60 medium-depth wells and 2360 shallow have been drilled and put into operation. These supply a dozen energy stations have been established in Xiong\u2019An.\nHu further explained that these stations use both geothermal heat and natural gas in a hybrid system. In cases of extreme cold weather, natural gas can be used to supplement geothermal and ensure a stable heat supply. When there is surplus geothermal heat, then the energy stations operate emissions-free. Xiong\u2019An has also started operations of a waste-to-energy facility for added heat supply.\nHu also noted that shallow geothermal energy is a key focus area for development, as these can also provide cooling. \u201cIt can not only utilize heat under the ground for winter heating, but also harness the soil\u2019s cooling capacity for summer cooling. It\u2019s an excellent renewable and sustainable energy solution,\u201d\nSource: ChinaDaily (\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya 28 Oct 2025 Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area 27 Oct 2025 Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines 22 Oct 2025 EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia 20 Oct 2025 Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia 17 Oct 2025 Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation 16 Oct 2025 China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated 16 Oct 2025 Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia 8 Oct 2025 Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia 3 Oct 2025 Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Studies done in the Rijnland geothermal permit area indicates that there is sufficient geothermal energy for the heat demand of 52,000 households and companies in the region. The consortium expects the first geothermal project to be operational by 2028.\nIn response to questions, a spokesperson from Shell stated, \u201cAlthough we expect that geothermal energy can play an important role in the Dutch heat transition in the long term, Shell currently sees insufficient prospects to scale up its geothermal activities.\u201d\n\u201cWe will therefore be talking to our partners in the various projects in the coming period to ensure a smooth transition. We will look for suitable solutions for the individual projects and permits.\u201d\n\u201cShell is therefore pleased with the many years of good cooperation in the field of geothermal energy, with project partners, governments and other stakeholders. Shell remains committed to supplying the energy of today and tomorrow, with more value against less emissions. We are constantly adapting our portfolio to this,\u201d\nAside from the Rijnland project, Shell is also involved in geothermal heating projects in Delft, Leeuwarden, Rotterdam, and Westland. There is no news yet on how Shell\u2019s business decision will affect these ongoing projects.\nFor the part of Aardwarmte Rijnland, the consortium is determined to continue the feasibility study being carried out with the Bollenstreek municipalities and housing corporation Stek and Sint Antonius van Padua.

The project findings are expected to help unlock new investment for the Mount Karthala project, which has been in development since 2008.\n#### Geothermal development in island nations: A strategic advantage\nThe Mount Karthala project is a significant development in the context of geothermal energy for island nations. Islands like the Comoros face unique energy challenges due to their reliance on imported fuels, which makes energy both expensive and vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. Geothermal energy offers a sustainable, locally sourced alternative that enhances both energy security and economic stability.\nFor the Comoros, developing its local geothermal energy resources could be transformative. Located in the Mozambique Channel, the country relies heavily on diesel generators and biomass for electricity and heating. With its volcanic activity, particularly around Mount Karthala, the Comoros holds significant untapped geothermal potential. The successful identification of groundwater resources as a drilling aid brings the country one step closer to realizing this potential, aligning with broader global goals of the energy transition such as the UN SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and reducing carbon footprints.\n#### The history of geothermal in the Comoros\nThe Comoros islands began their geothermal journey in 2008, when experts from Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) carried out geoscientific studies that confirmed the area\u2019s geothermal potential. Six years later, the Bureau G\u00e9ologique des Comores (BGC) conducted studies with the support of several consultants and service providers. The results indicated that the area has the potential to generate more than 45 MW of geothermal power.\nFollowing the study, the Comoros secured commitments from Geothermal Risk Mitigation Facility (GRMF), the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and other donors and financiers to proceed with the exploratory drilling, paving the way for a financial close thanks to a business plan that outlined a clear path to profitability.\n![]( sampling in Comoros (source: Bureau G\u00e9ologique des Comore)\nOne of the greatest hurdles to making a convincing argument that the Mount Karthala project is viable rests in the ability to support exploratory drilling using ground water, with expected expected water supply needs of 3,000 liters per minute for 60 days. Although the Grande Comore Island is characterized by abundant rainfall of between 1,500 and 2,000mm\/year, up to 4,000 mm\/year in the Mount Karthala area, the infiltration rate is estimated around 95%, meaning much of the precipitation flows into the underground and not into the sea.\nHowever, most of the country\u2019s wells are near the shore, making it unfeasible to pipe water up to the drilling area. Consequently, it was necessary to investigate the hydrogeological setting of the inner zones of the volcanic units of Mount Karthala to provide the necessary water supply.\n#### De-risking the reservoir model and the hydrological model\nSTEAM\u2019s involvement in the Comoros project, together with its partner GEL Energy, was divided into two strategic phases. In the first phase, working in collaboration with UNDP Comoros and local stakeholders, STEAM\u2019s team reviewed the existing resource assessments and project plan, and then developed a detailed roadmap for moving the project forward to the exploratory phase. In this phase, STEAM collaborated with United Downs geothermal project implemented in Cornwall (UK).\nIn the second phase, STEAM geologist Lorenzo Favaro worked with Viridien Group and Phoenix Geophysics to execute a two-week capacity building agenda and hydrogeological study. This phase confirmed the validity and integrity of the field testing instruments through a class and field training exercises for the BGC team.\nOnce adept in the use of the instruments, the project team executed an integrated magneto-telluric (MT) survey, which comprised an expanded field of 24 MT additional sites, extending the 3D resistivity model towards the northern area of the island. The expanded testing area aimed to expand the original model built by BGC in 2015, shifting the focus to the shallower layers on the northern side of the volcano in order to confirm the feasibility of shallow water wells, between 250 and 300m, foreseen in earlier studies.\nThe results of Phase 2 confirmed that it is reasonable to expect a water table depth of approximately 230-300 m g.l. in accordance with the original projections, though it also indicated that some wells would need to go deeper.\n![]( Karthala crater in Grande Comore island, Comoros (source:\n#### Expert insight from STEAM\u2019s Senior Geologist\nLorenzo Favaro, STEAM\u2019s Senior Geologist and lead for the project, emphasized the importance of a comprehensive approach in geothermal project development: \u201cAcquiring new data in tropical forests and inaccessible areas was a unique and trying experience, with many hours of walking, even at night. But all data\u2014geological, logistical, and environmental\u2014contribute to de-risking a geothermal project.\u201d\n\u201cA multidisciplinary company like STEAM, with our long and diverse experience, has the capability to work with all project stakeholders to build the complete datasets required to move past the surface exploration phase. Without this step, the deep exploration and subsequent design and construction phases of a geothermal plant are futile.\u201d\nSource: Email correspondence\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya 28 Oct 2025 Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya 6 Oct 2025 Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Kenya and France sign cooperation agreement to boost geothermal in East Africa 9 Sep 2025 Kenya and France sign cooperation agreement to boost geothermal in East Africa ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![New transmission line to widen geothermal power distribution in Kenya 12 Aug 2025 New transmission line to widen geothermal power distribution in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![KenGen receives Cabinet approval for Olkaria VII geothermal power plant, Kenya 6 Aug 2025 KenGen receives Cabinet approval for Olkaria VII geothermal power plant, Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![KenGen expects Olkaria 1 geothermal power plant rehabilitation to finish by June 2026 18 Jun 2025 KenGen expects Olkaria 1 geothermal power plant rehabilitation to finish by June 2026 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Canada and Tanzania partner on development of Meru geothermal prospect 22 May 2025 Canada and Tanzania partner on development of Meru geothermal prospect ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![How Kenya\u2019s energy policy is driving geothermal development 22 Apr 2025 How Kenya\u2019s energy policy is driving geothermal development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![KenGen secures geothermal exploration rights in Zambia and Tanzania 26 Mar 2025 KenGen secures geothermal exploration rights in Zambia and Tanzania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open for GRMF Heat Training Workshop; 2-3 April 2025, Tanzania 24 Mar 2025 Registration open for GRMF Heat Training Workshop; 2-3 April 2025, Tanzania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Kenya leverages geothermal supply in newly declared Olkaria Special Economic Zone 28 Feb 2025 Kenya leverages geothermal supply in newly declared Olkaria Special Economic Zone ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Steam Srl\u2019s studies lay foundation for Comoros geothermal roadmap 10 Feb 2025 Steam Srl\u2019s studies lay foundation for Comoros geothermal roadmap ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The company is unique in that it was founded by Shoji Numata, a supermarket mogul who envisions bringing a \u201cfranchise\u201d model to the geothermal business. Aside from focusing on small-scale development, Machiokoshi packages the geothermal projects as vehicles for multipurpose community economic revitalization. This means that the projects can provide opportunities beyond power production.\n#### Small projects shorten the development time\nCommenting on the trend of small-scale geothermal power development, Numata explained that the strategy significantly shortens the development time of geothermal power projects. \u201cMost existing geothermal power plants take more than 15 years to start operation. For private companies, dedicating personnel for such a long period of time before operation is a huge burden,\u201d\nThe fact that many sites are located within national parks and potentially coincide with operations of the hot spring industry also adds another layer of complexity to developing geothermal projects.\nFor the Oguni geothermal power project, the decision to limit the size to 5-MW significantly simplified the process. Instead of custom-made designs for the power plant, the company relied on a basic design that can be manufactured and deployed quickly.\nNumata further explains that environmental assessment of projects with a planned output of 7.5 MWe or more can take between 2 to 4 years. It can then take an additional 2 years for the design and manufacture of power plant equipment. This adds on to the approximately 10 years it takes to explore and evaluate the surface and subsurface characteristics of a potential project site.\nHowever, Numata remains steadfast in support of geothermal in Japan. \u201cJapan is not blessed with fossil fuel resources, but it is said to have the third highest potential in the world when it comes to geothermal energy. It is a stable source of power that we can be proud of.\u201d\n\u201cAs a Japanese company involved in renewable energy, we wonder what we are doing if we don\u2019t get serious about geothermal power.\u201d\n#### \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t exist, make it yourself\u201d\nNumata draws on his experience in the manufacturing and retail industry to carry the \u201cmaking what does not exist\u201d philosophy to geothermal. An example of this is the small, crawler-type drilling rig and mobile steam separator that the company designed in-house. This allows for drilling of geothermal boreholes up to 1 kilometer deep, even when there are no roads leading to the project sites.\nThis type of innovation not only shortened project development time, but also reduced costs significantly. \u201cWith the conventional tower method, the excavation cost for one hole would run into the hundreds of millions of yen, but with this method it only cost a few tens of millions of yen,\u201d\nNumata also established Geopower Academy, a vocation school for drilling in Hokkaido. The institution aims to bridge the competency gap left by the lack of institutional support for geothermal in Japan in the 1990s.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya 28 Oct 2025 Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area 27 Oct 2025 Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines 22 Oct 2025 EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia 20 Oct 2025 Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia 17 Oct 2025 Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation 16 Oct 2025 China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated 16 Oct 2025 Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia 8 Oct 2025 Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia 3 Oct 2025 Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

For geothermal projects, only two types are identified:\n* **\u201cTraditional geothermal with innovations\u201d** , referring to the optimization and\/or refurbishment of existing plants, or new plants; and\n* **\u201cGeothermal with zero emissions\u201d** , referring to plants that fully reinject all naturally occurring fluids and gases back into the same geothermal reservoir.\nIn both cases, FER 2 provides caps for the total combined capacity among all authorized projects:\n* 100 MWe for \u201cTraditional geothermal with innovations\u201d, which are eligible for incentive tariffs of 100 \u20ac\/MWh over a 25-year lifespan, and\n* 60 MWe for \u201cGeothermal with zero emissions\u201d, which are eligible for incentive tariffs of 200 \u20ac\/MWh over a 25-year lifespan\nBy comparison, the cap for Offshore wind is 3,800 MW and includes an incentive tariff of 185 \u20ac\/MWh while the cap for Offshore floating photovoltaics is 200 MW and includes an incentive tariff of 100 \u20ac\/MWh over a 20-year lifespan.\nPayment will be managed through Contracts of Difference (CfD), where GSE will pay plant owners the difference between the tariff due and the market price of the energy. Where this difference is positive, the GSE pays the incentives by applying a premium tariff to the net production injected into the grid. Where the difference is negative, the GSE requests the corresponding amount from the producer.\nIn order to apply for the tariff, however, developers must have already obtained an authorization for the construction and operation of the plant, or an authorized EIA for the geothermal project, as well as an approved grid connection estimate.\nDevelopers must also abide by the stated timeframes for project implementation in order to obtain the tariff incentive: for \u201cTraditional geothermal with innovations\u201d, new plants must be operational within 51 months and refurbished plants within 36 months and \u201cZero-emissions geothermal plants\u201d must be operational within 5 years.\n![]( towers of the Larderello geothermal plant, Tuscany\/ Italy (source: flickr\/ Giacomo Carena, creative commons)\n#### FER 2: Limitations and Potential Roadblocks\nWhile Italy\u2019s PNIEC\n\u201cDespite glowing conclusions from public-private consultations like that of Ambrosetti\u2019s spring 2024 report on geothermal\u2019s potential in accelerating the energy transition in Italy, the FER 2 legislation\u2014which was written by the Italian government\u2014is widely seen as having failed to achieve the necessary frameworks needed to return Italy to the world stage as a geothermal development hub,\u201d\u201cThe lack of long-term planning and clear targets for geothermal usage, especially in district heating and cooling, reflects a missed opportunity.\u201d\nPaolo Basile, Steam\u2019s Head of Geosciences and Environment and board member at Unione Geotermica Italiana, expressed concern about the permitting procedures. While the FER2 incentives were finally rolling out for Italy\u2019s geothermal market, the implementation timeline restrictions for the projects could hamper the overall efforts.\n\u201cEven when projects meet FER2 requirements, they could face significant delays due to Italy\u2019s slow permitting processes, including potential calls to TAR (Regional Administrative Courts) appeals, where specific interest groups can tie projects up in legal quagmires. Administrative hurdles, lengthy approval periods, and regional complexities make it challenging for developers to get projects off the ground in a timely manner.\u201d\n\u201cA more inclusive approach,\u201d \u201cwith broader eligibility criteria and streamlined permitting processes, is crucial for Italy to capitalize on this sustainable resource. For Italy to meet its ambitious climate-energy targets, such as in PNIEC, geothermal must move from the sidelines to center stage.\u201d\n![]( plant at Castelnuovo di Val di Cecina, Tuscany\/Italy (Gabriele Delhey, commons\/ wikimedia)\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Konris Maynard of St. Kitts and Nevis with James Ellsmoor, CEO of Island Innovation (source: Island Innovation)\n![ ](\n![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 15 Apr 2025\nDeveloping a geothermal power project has been a transformative process for St. Kitts and Nevis, setting it on a path to being a fully sustainable island state.\n![](\n![](\n![](\nAs part of the buildup to this year\u2019s Global Sustainable Islands Summit 2025, James Ellsmoor, CEO of Island Innovation, did an interview with Hon. Konris Maynard of the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis. The insights from that conversation have been published below.\nThe Caribbean twin-island Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis is embarking on an ambitious journey that could transform it into the Western Hemisphere\u2019s first fully sustainable independent nation. During a recent conversation with Hon. Konris Maynard, Minister of Public Infrastructure, Energy, Utilities, and ICT, I gained valuable insights into how this small nation is tackling large energy challenges through innovative approaches to geothermal development.\n#### Energy: the central tool for sustainable economic development\nFor Small Island Developing States (SIDS), energy isn\u2019t just about keeping the lights on\u2014it\u2019s the foundation upon which all economic development rests. Minister Konris Maynard emphasised how the current high energy costs are significantly impacting the Federation\u2019s economy, with the government currently subsidising residential electricity costs through the Fuel Variation Charge to shield consumers from the full burden of escalating global fuel prices.\nThis subsidy, while necessary in the short term, represents a substantial fiscal challenge apparent across many SIDS that diverts resources from other critical development areas. The economic implications extend beyond household budgets, as high energy costs also deter energy-intensive industries from establishing operations in the Federation, limiting economic diversification and employment opportunities.\nThe government\u2019s push toward renewable energy, particularly geothermal, represents a strategic shift away from this previous model toward one that promises both economic and environmental benefits.\n![]( Friars Bay in St Kitts (source: Island Innovation)\n#### Geothermal: a game-changing resource\nSaint Kitts & Nevis possesses distinct advantages for geothermal development that make it particularly promising. As Minister Maynard explained, \u201cThe heat amount is much closer to the surface than in other areas of the world, so you don\u2019t have to drill as deep to get to it.\u201d This geological advantage significantly reduces exploration and development costs.\nThe journey toward harnessing this resource has been complex, involving multiple administrations and financial institutions. The current breakthrough came through providing $17 million USD\u2014$16 million for drilling and $1 million for technical support. The innovative risk-sharing mechanism converts to a concessionary loan if drilling succeeds or a grant if it fails, thereby reducing the financial risk for the Federation.\nHowever, this funding alone wasn\u2019t sufficient to attract top-tier drilling companies to the project. Minister Maynard noted that the $16 million would only fund approximately three wells, making it challenging to entice global drilling experts to mobilise for such a limited scope. The solution came through , bringing the total available funding to $36 million\u2014enough to drill five wells (three production wells and two reinjection wells).\nPerhaps equally important was resolving the long-standing political challenge between the federal government and the Nevis Island Administration (NIA). The current administration took a decisive step by passing a resolution in the National Assembly declaring geothermal resources on Nevis a federal asset that will receive federal support. This political alignment between the two administrations sends a clear signal to international partners about the Federation\u2019s united commitment to the SKNICE \u2013 St. Kitts and Nevis Islands Climate Enhancement Project, for the benefit of all citizens of St. Kitts and Nevis.\n![]( Nevis Peak volcano (source: Island Innovation)\n#### Connecting the islands: one electrical grid\nOne of the most transformative aspects of the geothermal development plan is the potential to create a unified electrical grid connecting St. Kitts and Nevis. Minister Maynard highlighted how this interconnection would allow industries on either island to benefit from renewable energy resources developed on either island, creating a more resilient and flexible energy ecosystem.\n\u201cWith geothermal, it justifies interconnecting the two islands. St. Kitts and Nevis then becomes one electrical grid, so any industry developed on St. Kitts or Nevis will be able to share any renewable energy resource on either island,\u201d\nThis approach maximises the utility of renewable resources across the Federation and creates a more attractive environment for industries that require reliable, affordable electricity. The unified grid represents a physical manifestation of the political collaboration now taking place between the federal government and the Nevis Island Administration.\n#### Beyond self-sufficiency: becoming a net energy exporter\nPerhaps the most ambitious aspect of St. Kitts and Nevis\u2019 energy vision is the potential to move beyond self-sufficiency to become a net energy exporter to neighboring islands. With initial estimates suggesting the geothermal wells could produce between 5-10 megawatts each\u2014potentially yielding 15-30 megawatts\u2014the Federation could generate more electricity than it currently needs.\nMinister Maynard envisions two potential avenues for this surplus energy. First, direct electricity export through undersea cables to nearby islands. Having personally visited Mallorca and witnessed its 250km undersea interconnection with Spain, the Minister noted that Antigua is just 60km away and St. Martin approximately 50km\u2014making such connections technically feasible.\nSecond, using surplus energy for what energy experts call \u201cPower-to-X\u201d applications\u2014converting electricity into other valuable products like hydrogen or ammonia. This approach could create new industries and export opportunities beyond simply selling electricity.\n\u201cWith this vast resource of geothermal, it opens up industries but also justifies interconnecting with other islands,\u201cRight here in the Caribbean, we can be a beacon of energy that interconnects with these islands.\u201d\n![]( Global Sustainable Islands Summit \u2013 May 25-30, 2025; St Kitts and Nevis\n#### Becoming part of History\nAs St. Kitts and Nevis prepares to host the and the , Minister Maynard extended an invitation to renewable energy stakeholders worldwide to participate in these events.\n\u201cThis is an opportunity to be part of history,\u201d he emphasised. \u201cWe are on a path to make St. Kitts and Nevis the first fully sustainable island state in the Western hemisphere and perhaps even the world.\u201d\nThe Minister\u2019s closing observation captures the essence of what makes this small nation\u2019s approach to energy so compelling:**\n**_\u201cSt. Kitts and Nevis is small enough to make big changes.\u201d_\nThe Federation is demonstrating how opposing political parties can align behind a shared vision of sustainability, and how a nation with limited resources can leverage strategic partnerships to undertake transformative energy projects.\nFor those interested in renewable energy development, particularly in island contexts, the upcoming presents a unique opportunity to witness this ambitious vision taking shape and to explore partnership opportunities in what promises to be a showcase for sustainable island development.\nFor more insights from the interview with Hon.

As part of the project, a 1,900-meter production well and a 1,000-meter reinjection well are planned to be drilled.\nPreviously, a \u201cNo EIA Required\u201d decision was issued for drilling at two different locations within the same license area. However, a public meeting led to the the selection of a new drill site for the well originally planned at Parcel 183, Block 1 in the village of Yesilyurt. Following geophysical studies, Parcel 57 and Block 174 were designated as the new exploration area.\nOnce the EIA process is completed, field operations will begin. Additionally, permits from the State Hydraulic Works (DS?) and the Provincial Directorate of Agriculture and Forestry will be required for drilling on agricultural land. Since the EIA area is classified as \u201cAgricultural Land\u201d in the Balikesir-Canakkale Regional Planning Map (1\/100,000 Scale Environmental Plan), the impact of activities on agricultural areas will also be carefully assessed.\nGeothermal exploration activities have picked up pace in recent years in the Ayvacik region of Canakkale.

Geothermal energy is a fully domestic and national resource that lies beneath us everywhere, does not rely on imports, and serves the common welfare of the Turkish people. There is no other energy source that is as local and independent.\u201d\nHighlighting the uninterrupted and reliable nature of geothermal energy compared to other renewable energy sources, Kindap noted that it is a significant advantage for T\u00fcrkiye to meet these critical energy needs with a clean and abundant domestic resource.\nKindap also stressed that geothermal drilling, technically similar to oil drilling, places the entire financial burden and risk on the investor. He argued that including these investments in the strategic investment\n#### T\u00fcrkiye Could Become an Energy Exporter\nReferring to the current installed capacity of geothermal energy-based electricity generation in T\u00fcrkiye, which stands at 1,700 MW5,000 MW\nKindap underscored that the **63 geothermal power plants operating in T\u00fcrkiye** utilize internationally recognized, environmentally friendly production technologies and provided the following evaluation:\n\u201cGeothermal energy investments are unique localization projects, offering T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s resources for the prosperity of its people. As the Turkish geothermal energy sector, we bring these projects into operation with astounding speed and success, using our own capital, workforce, and technology. We are working to ensure our country benefits more from this endless resource and creates additional value. T\u00fcrkiye is an energy-rich nation.\nBy giving more importance to clean energy resources, supporting and incentivizing them, and bringing them online, our country can easily rise to the level of an \u2018energy-exporting nation,\u2019 which may seem like a dream today. By utilizing geothermal energy, an infinite resource, to serve our nation\u2019s common welfare, we can elevate our fourth-place global ranking to a clear leadership position.

Supported by Dalkia, the two cities are launching the expansion of their heating network and the drilling of a new geothermal well in 2026, supplemented by a heat pump system.\nThe network is planned to be fuelled by nearly 80% renewable and inexhaustible energy. The city of Melun is thus continuing its commitment, having already set an example in 1969 by choosing geothermal energy for the first time to feed its heating network.\nThe network will expand this year in both cities and will pass under the Seine to extend south of Melun. It will extend for an additional 17 km, or more than 43 km of pipeline, and will include 115 new substations. It will provide 68 GWh of additional heat and cover the heating and domestic hot water needs of 18,500 equivalent homes.\n\u201cThe city of Melun\u2019s investment in geothermal energy is historic and is about to reach a new milestone. In a context of rising energy costs and global warming, this choice appears more relevant than ever for the future. This choice allows Melun residents to benefit from real energy savings, since for a \u201ctypical\u201d home, geothermal energy represents a heating cost of approximately 30% compared to a collective gas heating solution.\u201d\nThese new connections and installations will save 12,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. This figure is in addition to the 16,000 tonnes of CO2 already saved annually thanks to the existing district heating network, for a total of 28,000 tonnes of CO2 saved annually.\n\u201cIn the context of the upgrading of the heating networks in the city of Vauxle-P\u00e9nil, supported by ADEME, we are pleased that this partnership can provide a new opportunity for our energy transition policy. The expansion of our shared network is a future challenge for renewable energies. This will require a dynamic policy that will need to be integrated into our housing obligations. We welcome the significant administrative, legal, and technical work that has enabled us to implement this joint public service delegation project.\u201d\nThis new contract signed with\nThe drilling, development and modernization work on the new network represents a total investment of nearly EUR 75 million.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![\u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 28 Oct 2025 \u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

With geothermal fluids easily capable of eroding conventional materials at an alarming rate \u2013 including very damaging short-term spikes in pH \u2013 even small variations in hardness and chemistry can have a significant impact on your turbines.\nWith some clever and prudent thinking, geothermal operators can ensure that their turbines run efficiently. Proactive steps include:\n* Appropriate material selection \u2013 choosing the right materials to withstand harsh conditions\n* Robust shutdown and moisture removal processes \u2013 proper procedures during outages\n* Periodic steam path monitoring \u2013 regular checks and repairs\n* Steam chemistry control \u2013 strict regulation to prevent erosion and corrosion\n* Retrofit of steam paths\n![]( welding in shaft area of steam turbine rotor (source: EthosEnergy)\n### Combatting challenges with state-of-the-art solutions\nStaying one step ahead and being prepared for anything is crucial in avoiding major problems related to turbines in geothermal power generation. Let\u2019s look at some of the factors that operators need to consider:\n* #### Moisture\nMoisture problems are incredibly common in geothermal plants, often causing wear-and-tear damage to the tenons (the protruding parts used to attach shrouds to the blades on the turbine rotor). This happens mostly due to harsh conditions like corrosive steam. Combined with the risk of chemical deposition, moisture problems can cause a disaster if left untreated.\nTo tackle moisture and tenon erosion in geothermal turbines and to reduce tenon erosion change to integral covers, EthosEnergy provides a Stellite\u2122 shield or solid coupon.\nIntegral covers are specially designed to eliminate tenons, as the shroud is machined integral with the blade using accurate geometry to ensure proper blade damping. Existing turbines or new turbine designs can be equipped with blades having integral covers for life extension.\nAnother of the design improvements introduced by EthosEnergy includes control stages with integral covers made from titanium. The material density lowers the stress on the wheel and blades, while the titanium\u2019s material properties minimize fouling, which can decrease the turbine\u2019s flow capacity and, in turn, diminish output.\nBy implementing these solutions, operators can ensure that turbines operate more efficiently and have longer service intervals. These ultimately result in reduced downtime and lower maintenance costs.\n* #### Tall blades\nIn geothermal turbines, tall blades are particularly susceptible to harsh operating conditions, including high moisture content and corrosive steam. To enhance the durability and performance of these blades, advanced material options well-known for their strength and corrosion resistance can be considered, including:\n* 403 SS\/X15 \u2013 403 Stainless Steel (SS), well known for its solid mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. The X15 variant is often used for its superior strength and durability in corrosive environments.\n* M152 (Jet Heat) \u2013 this advanced alloy is known for its high-erosion resistance and resistance to oxidation and corrosion.\n* 17-4 PH \u2013 this precipitation-hardening stainless steel also provides high strength and hardness, as well as excellent corrosion resistance.\n* Titanium \u2013 renowned for its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and excellent corrosion and erosion resistance.\nEthosEnergy also provides treatments to enhance the durability of tall blades, such as laser hardening, flame hardening, and various coatings like metallic layers to provide additional protection.\nBy using this combination of advanced materials and treatments, geothermal operators can ensure that tall blades in geothermal turbines can withstand extreme conditions. This results in improved efficiency, reduced maintenance costs over time, fewer parts replacements, and less downtime.\n* #### Analysis\nEven with the proper selection of materials, operators still need to monitor and analyze the performance of their turbines. Analysis is key to understanding the natural frequencies of blade dynamics:\n* Vibratory stresses at resonance\n* Blade and rotor centrifugal stress\n* Blade fixation issues\nEthosEnergy can provide the experience and technical expertise to analyze these blade dynamics at each geothermal plant, helping customers to stay within allowable limits.\n* #### Repair, reblade, redesign\nTo keep a geothermal plant running as it should, repair, reblade, and redesign solutions ensure the best outcomes for turbines, whether it\u2019s wheel welds or reconfiguring blades based on failure analysis, erosion issues, or control systems.\n* #### Inspections\nRegular inspections \u2013 including visual, magnetic particle, and other forms of non-destructive testing (NDT) \u2013 are also vital for geothermal turbines. Inspections can highlight any issues like surface cracks, blade and shroud damage, erosion, and corrosion. Operators need to address all of these as soon as possible to avoid further issues.\nInspections may require ongoing solutions to be implemented. Making these repairs or replacements right away will help to avoid costly downtime. These solutions can include:\n* Improved materials, coatings, and steam quality for blade issues\n* Stainless steels upgrades\n* Inconel weld repairs to inner and outer diaphragm rings\n* Improved moisture separation features\n* Wheel replacements with improved materials and lower stress designs\n![]( turbine diaphragm inspection after weld repair (source: EthosEnergy)\n### Full steam ahead for geothermal plants\nIn the exciting race towards renewable power, geothermal power plant operators need the expertise and solutions required to maximize equipment efficiency and production. This is critical regardless of location, OEM, or lifecycle stage. With their proven capabilities and innovative, independent approaches, EthosEnergy is ready to support the growing geothermal sector in addressing challenges such as moisture and corrosion.\nAs geothermal energy becomes an increasingly vital element in the global energy mix, geothermal power operators can benefit greatly from improved turbine efficiency and lower operations and maintenance costs.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards 23 Oct 2025 Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Arup 13 Oct 2025 Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Aru ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress 10 Oct 2025 Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya 6 Oct 2025 Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa 2 Oct 2025 The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels 24 Sep 2025 Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France 18 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! 17 Sep 2025 One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest 15 Sep 2025 Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees 12 Sep 2025 Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

(Taiwan),Taiwan International Geothermal Conference 2025April 24\u201325, 2025,CPC Building, Taipei\nThe conference will cover Taiwan\u2019s geothermal energy progress, global trends, and cutting-edge technologies, including Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS)Advanced Geothermal Systems (AGS)\nThe Energy Agency lowered the 2025 geothermal target from 200 MW to 20 MW in 2023, and then raised the 2030 geothermal target to 1.2-1.5 GW in 2025. Taiwan\u2019s geothermal targets are finally catching up to international development trajectories and successful models.\nRecently, the international community has significantly increased geothermal targets for the net zero strategy, hoping to inject advanced technology and investment from the oil industry into the geothermal industry, which has huge potential. The successful commercialization of new-generation geothermal technology in Germany and the United States is a key factor, which is also a blind spot ignored by mainstream media and traditional energy experts.\nTaiwan\u2019s geothermal industry is still in its early stages of development. The current situation is similar to the situation six years ago when offshore wind power was first demonstrated in Taiwan. The cost is high and the construction speed is slow. It is still overcoming the learning curve, which is why many traditional energy experts are pessimistic. To date, Taiwan has introduced advanced industrial chains through international cooperation. Offshore wind farms are no longer afraid of strong typhoons and have gradually evolved into the next stage of floating wind turbine farms, becoming a successful model among Asian democratic countries, far surpassing Japan and South Korea.\nMany energy experts are unaware that Taiwan will have four geothermal power plants connected to the grid this year, and that their individual well power generation capacity has not yet completed the learning curve, with a production capacity of only about 1 MW. Currently, geothermal power generation has been commercialized in 32 countries. Driven by mature industrial chains, the single-well production capacity in emerging countries can reach 4-7 MW, such as Chile and Croatia, which is more than 10 times the current average in Taiwan. This learning curve depends on the degree of cooperation in the international industrial chain, which is exactly the same as offshore wind power.\nThe United States is the world\u2019s largest geothermal power producer. Its Department of Energy has long invested in and subsidized geothermal-related technology research and development. The oil industry and RE100 technology industry have both invested heavily in geothermal technology. The development trend of geothermal energy has been further stimulated by President Trump\u2019s coming to power.\nIt is expected that the average cost of next-generation geothermal power generation will be about US$0.06-0.07 per kWh in five years, and will drop to US$0.045 per kWh in 2035, which is much lower than the cost estimated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (US$0.2 per kWh) and lower than the cost of advanced nuclear energy at US$0.099 per kWh.\nDetails and registration for the event:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya 28 Oct 2025 Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area 27 Oct 2025 Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines 22 Oct 2025 EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia 20 Oct 2025 Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia 17 Oct 2025 Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation 16 Oct 2025 China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated 16 Oct 2025 Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia 8 Oct 2025 Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia 3 Oct 2025 Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Technology\n# TerraThermo and Eden GeoPower to collaborate on geothermal project in Germany\n!TerraThermo and Eden GeoPower to collaborate on geothermal project in Germany Eden GeoPower and TerraThermo announce collaboration for Projekt THERMO (source: TerraThermo)\n![ ](\n![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 3 Dec 2024\nTerraThermo and Eden GeoPower will collaborate on a 12-MW geothermal power project in Lower Saxony, Germany using Eden's electrical stimulation technology.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n\u201cProjekt THERMO,\u201d\nPart of the collaboration will be the assessment of the feasibility of deploying Eden\u2019s \u201cElectrical Reservoir Stimulation\u201d technology in Projekt THERMO, which is being developed by TerraThermo. The Parties are expecting that Eden\u2019s technology would be implemented in the Projekt THERMO in 2026\/2027, when the relevant wells are drilled.\n\u201cWe are delighted to be working with Eden GeoPower, to bring their technology to Europe. The next generation of natural resource recovery technologies are critical in the energy transition. Europe has a long history of geothermal heat and power generation, but facilities have often been unable to achieve required production rates due to restrictions on traditional hydraulic fracturing, so we expect that Eden\u2019s technology will be extremely important for project developers and will be supported by legislators and the public,\u201d\n\u201cWe are delighted to partner with TerraThermo to bring our technology to Europe. We believe that our technology is ideally suited to Projekt THERMO and the operating environment in Europe. With our alternative, water-minimal electric based rock stimulation technology, we can increase permeability and avoid the injection of large volumes of water into the reservoir,\u201d\n\u201cWe believe that our technology can be a game changer for the European renewable energy market, particularly for deep geothermal. Our new engagement with TerraThermo highlights our goals to bring the value of our technology to the European market and assist many countries in achieving their renewable energy goals.\u201d\n#### Support for a project pipeline\nBeyond Projekt THERMO, the Parties have agreed to collaborate more widely in Europe. TerraThermo expects that the 12MW geothermal power plant would be the first of many, with the potential for multiple projects in Germany and other European countries.\nTerraThermo\u2019s project development pipeline (including Projekt THERMO) is aligned with Eden\u2019s objectives of enhancing subsurface permeability in the geothermal industry. TerraThermo will seek to use Eden\u2019s technology in its projects, where possible. The company had just recently secured investment from alfa8 to support Projekt THERMO.\n#### Eden\u2019s \u201cElectrical Reservoir Stimulation\u201d Technology\nEden has developed a first-of-its-kind Electrical Reservoir Stimulation (ERS) technology to increase the recovery of natural resources and improve the economics of resource recovery with minimal environmental impact.\nIts patented ERS Technology uses electricity to enhance permeability, increasing the recovery of new and existing assets. Eden\u2019s technology reduces water consumption, curbs carbon emissions, and mitigates the seismicity risks that come with traditional hydraulic fracturing, making the process fundamentally more sustainable.\nEden\u2019s unique approach is equally well suited to enhancing subsurface permeability across industries, including geothermal.\nBy using high-voltage electricity and advanced reservoir monitoring techniques, Eden increases rock permeability while controlling the direction of the generated fracture network, targeting specific subsurface areas more precisely. This allows for a step change improvement in reservoir productivity and, as a result, the economic viability of energy transition initiatives that lever geological reservoirs.\nERS is an evolution from traditional hydraulic-fracturing methods which are water-intensive and create uncontrollable fractures, or \u201cshort-circuits,\u201d that can hinder fluid flow and obstruct re-stimulation, functionally ending a reservoir\u2019s economic viability. Additional benefits of ERS include a substantial reduction in the number of trucks necessary for fluid and proppant transportation, emissions from wastewater treatment, pumping horsepower requirements, and seismic events. The result is a reduction in CO2 emissions, water consumption, and associated environmental hazards compared to traditional hydraulic-fracturing operations.\nSource: Email correspondence\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Technology\n# Storing energy underground : Reservoir thermal energy storage shows promise\n!Storing energy underground : Reservoir thermal energy storage shows promise Storing renewable energy underground: Thermal energy storage shows promise - a guest article by Teverra\n![ ](\n![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 12 Feb 2025\nReservoir thermal energy storage has huge potential for increasing the application of geothermal, particularly as a complement to solar and wind power.\n![](\n![](\n![](\nStudies on the potential of storing renewable energy underground have been ongoing for some time. In the last few years, this field of study has gained momentum associated with the continued deployment of low-cost variable renewable energy (VRE) (Green et al., 2021). Research institutions and technology companies are examining ways to safely and economically harness the subsurface as a storage medium, which has the potential to significantly accelerate the growth of energy storage and capacity in the coming years (Sharan et al., 2020).\nThis guest article written by\nCurrently, thermal energy production (not storage) for electricity is still not competitive with natural gas and other renewables. Geothermal power is a low-carbon source of energy with no intermittent problems. However, the costs associated with drilling wells in deep and hard-rock formations, where temperatures are hot enough for electricity production, makes it difficult to compete with other technologies aimed at power generation.\nThe areas where a suitable temperature gradient is at a reasonable depth are not found everywhere which limits the technology to parts of the US and the world (NREL, 2023). Figure below shows resource availability and colocation limitation not available everywhere.\n![]( Resources of the United States available and colocation limitation \u2013 Not available everywhere (NREL, 2023)\n#### What is reservoir thermal energy storage?\nThe general concept of reservoir thermal energy storage (RTES) is simple. The Earth acts as a giant thermal battery to store excess renewable energy like solar and wind. When paired with these VRE sources, RTES produces a complete, reliable and resilient renewable energy solution.\nFor example, solar energy production typically peaks in the summer when daylight is the longest, which often leads to surplus electricity generation. This surplus, if paired with sufficient storage, could provide energy beyond diurnal electricity cycles, up to 1000+ hours of energy storage. Similarly, wind patterns can vary by location and season, with some regions experiencing consistent seasonal wind patterns. Seasonal high wind energy generation is valuable by itself but can be fully utilized and monetized when paired with equivalent seasonal energy storage, that being, RTES.\nA reliable, resilient 24\/7 electricity grid is closer to commerciality thanks to research and development in RTES and unique systems being developed, such as Teverra\u2019s\nRTES systems like ResStor are a potential solution to the VRE conundrum because these systems ensure a steady and dependable supply of clean electricity. Still, this system is not without challenges. To date, RTES is still at the research and development phase, requiring key field demonstrations and technology advancements to become an integrated part of the current and future energy system.\nTo understand the size of the industrial heat market, the Figure below shows the data for heat and cooling demand for the US.? For heat use in the moderate temperature range (125 \u2013 250 \u00b0F \/ 52 \u2013 121 \u00b0C), there is a market demand of 350+ trillion BTUs per year.\n![]( (a) heating and (b) cooling demand by U.S. in Terajoule (TJ) (Oh & Beckers, 2023)\nThis article highlights the significant role that these systems can play, providing a sense of reassurance about the reliability of renewable energy. By knowing how to design and operate these systems effectively, we can pave the way for a future where geothermal energy is critical in storing and delivering clean power from renewable sources.\nHere, we explain how RTES works and how it provides energy resiliency for long-term VRE sources, using the Teverra ResStor system as an example. We discuss how it can still be improved as well as point out the additional benefits to implementation of RTES systems.\n#### How ResStor works\nThe ResStor system operates as a thermal energy battery. Excess energy is used to heat water. This hot water is injected underground through strategically placed wells into permeable rock formations. The Earth, with low thermal conductivity and diffusivity, acts as a natural insulator, trapping the heat within the rock. When energy is needed, the hot water is extracted from the reservoir and used. This can be used as direct heat or used to generate power through a conventional geothermal power plant. Because of the natural thermal energy storage properties of the subsurface, this system provides a long-term solution to energy storage.(Porlles et al., 2023)\n![]( Renewable Energy Underground: ResStor (Soroush et al., 2022)\n#### Optimizing the system: Well design makes a difference\nThe roundtrip thermal efficiency of RTES systems is one of the key value drivers of these systems. Still, there are challenges associated with accessing the significant subsurface space required for 1000+ hours of energy storage.\nRecent studies have yielded significant insights into optimizing RTES system designs for maximum efficiency. Studies have compared various well configurations, mainly focusing on the placement and orientation of the wells within the reservoir.\nThese findings hold significant weight because they can significantly impact the economic feasibility of large-scale RTES projects. By identifying well designs that maximize heat capture and minimize energy loss, drilling advances and potentially lower drilling costs can be achieved; this translates to RTES becoming a more attractive option for large-scale renewable energy integration. Optimizing well design paves the way for cost-effective and efficient RTES systems, accelerating their potential to become a cornerstone technology for a clean energy future.\nBeyond efficiency: The broader benefits of RTES\nThe promise of RTES extends far beyond simply addressing the intermittent challenge of renewables. Additional benefits include location flexibility, grid stability, and environmental benefits.\nFor location flexibility, unlike conventional geothermal resources, which are limited to geologically active areas, systems like ResStor can be created almost anywhere with suitable underground rock formations. This adaptability opens possibilities for utilizing renewable energy sources in regions with limited geothermal resources but abundant solar or wind energy.\nRegarding grid stability, ResStor can act as a buffer for the electricity grid, providing a reliable power source during peak demand periods or unexpected outages, which helps to stabilize the grid and reduce reliance on fossil fuel backup generators.\nThrough these added benefits, ResStor and similar systems mitigate climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by storing excess renewable energy and displacing fossil fuel generation.\nThe road ahead: Challenges and opportunities\nWhile the potential of RTES systems is undisputable, various challenges must be overcome before widespread adoption occurs. These key challenges include cost reduction and environmental impact.\nDrilling and operating systems like ResStor still require a significant upfront investment and are cost reduction constrained by wellbore and renewable energy input cost. Research and development efforts are crucial to reducing drilling costs and optimizing system design for improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness. While the geothermal industry does not control the cost of the incoming energy source, overall system efficiency improvements make the input energy more valuable on a cost per energy unit basis.\nOne concern not completely addressed to date is the environmental impact of RTES systems. The potential for water contamination is one common concern, as well as the increase in wellbores and associated energy system footprint.\nBoth environmental concerns can be mitigated through optimized system design, specifically the well field development. Water contamination is mitigated through several design parameters. First, the overall well design is made to hydrologically separate freshwater aquifers from deeper, non-potable aquifers. Through this design, water contamination risks are mitigated. Additionally, ResStor targets non-potable aquifers, and is performed in a non-consumptive fashion, so freshwater is in no way a part of the ResStor system.\nSimilarly, the wells and the well field can be designed to optimize energy storage efficiency. Several wellbore designs and well placement designs were tested as part of the ResStor design development, with numerical simulations used to optimize the power density per well and round trip thermal efficiency. By producing an optimized energy efficiency per wellbore, the footprint for the energy system can also be optimized, that is, the greatest energy density per unit of land use.\n#### A brighter future with subsurface batteries\nRTES systems including ResStor offer a groundbreaking solution for storing renewable energy and unlocking the full potential of solar and wind power. By addressing the intermittent nature of these energy sources and by providing a reliable, clean, and location-flexible storage option, RTES systems can be pivotal in our transition to a clean energy future. Still, their full potential is not yet realized (Armstrong, 2022).\nA field demonstration is required to show this energy storage system as a technically and commercially viable energy storage system. It will also provide an opportunity to identify continued challenges. Further collaboration between private industry, public support, higher education, national laboratories, and policymakers can further enhance RTES capabilities and make this energy storage technology a cornerstone technology for a sustainable energy future.\n#### References\nArmstrong, R.

The goal for the well would be provide information to evaluate whether the deep water be used for a geothermal plant at the Federal Office of Sport\u2019s (FOSP) National Sports Center in Magglingen.\nIf exploration drilling is successful, the well can likely begin supplying heat to the Magglingen National Sports Center of the\nIn 2023, the Federal Office for Climate Protection (BBL) conducted an underground survey in the region around Magglingen. The aim of the extensive investigations was to obtain the most precise possible geological map of Magglingen\u2019s subsurface and to gain insights into potential warm deep water sources for geothermal heat generation. The analysis of the collected data suggests several potential deep water reservoirs.\nFrom this initial image of the subsurface, the course and location of geological layers and faults can be derived. Due to the complex subsurface beneath Magglingen, an area of uncertainty remains in the interpretation of this data and the resulting model. Further measures and investigations are intended to further reduce the uncertainty and the associated risk of failure in any drilling operation.\nExploratory drilling is necessary for many geothermal projects because the exact location of the deep water is uncertain and key parameters such as water temperature, water volume, and flow rate are unknown. These factors are crucial for the economic use of the deep water. The planned exploratory drilling at a depth of approximately 1,500 to 2,300 meters will reduce existing uncertainties and project risks. At the same time, it will provide important insights into the subsurface.\n![]( cross-section through a first geological model of the Magglingen study site (source: Hydro-G\u00e9o Environnement)\n#### Funding sought from the Federal Parliament\nThe implementation of the exploratory drilling and the drilling for deep water utilization requires funding approval from the Federal Parliament. The Federal Office for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FOBL) will compile the costs of the drilling by the end of 2025 and will likely present them to Parliament as part of the 2026 Real Estate Dispatch. In addition to funding approval from Parliament, drilling permits from the cantonal authorities are also required for the drilling for deep water utilization.\nThese investigations are part of many other measures being taken by the Federal Office of Public Safety (BBL) to reduce environmental impacts at the Federal Office of Public Safety (FOSP) site. For example, a district heating network for most of the FOSPO buildings in Magglingen was completed last year, powered by wood pellets from a temporary energy center. In addition, the appropriate infrastructure at the Magglingen National Sports Center is being continuously equipped with photovoltaic systems.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![\u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 28 Oct 2025 \u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

These parcels were nominated by the public. The nominated parcels are located within the Snake River Plain, in rural areas. Land uses include livestock grazing and agriculture, utility and road rights-of-way (ROW), and wildlife habitat.\nA geothermal lease typically grants the lessee access to geothermal resources in the lease area for a period of 10 years. The terms of the lease require the lessee to show a certain level of diligence toward developing the geothermal resources within the lease area or the lease may be terminated. Once an area is developed for productive use of geothermal energy, the lease allows the lessee use of the resource for 35 years with a right of renewal for another 55 years.\nThe BLM is required to hold a competitive lease sale at least once every two-years if there are nominations pending (43 CFR \u00a7 3202.13).

The next step would be to conduct a large-scale geophysical survey of the subsurface in the Aachen urban region and drill two exploration boreholes. Moreover, Fraunhofer IEG will build a research center in Weisweiler for georesources and decarbonization.\n#### A decisive step for geothermal in North Rhine-Westphalia\nFor the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, the project is an important step in the implementation of the Geothermal Energy Master Plan. The project will contribute to the ramp up of geothermal energy in the region by providing subsurface data which will then be the bases for subsequent geothermal projects. If the exploration results are positive, the people, municipalities and companies in the region will have the opportunity to tap into geothermal as a cost-effective and regional heat source.\n\u201cThe \u201cFraunhofer Real Laboratory\u201d can make a decisive contribution to this for the Rhineland region and the Aachen urban region. With this project, we are jointly and innovatively driving forward the heat transition in North Rhine-Westphalia. We are focusing on transparency. I have great confidence in the Fraunhofer IEG, which is actively involving citizens. Together we are making NRW more sustainable,\u201d\n\u201cThe southern Rhineland has a rich history of using its natural energy resources \u2013 from the use of thermal water in Roman times for local heating and later for the medieval cloth industry, to the modern spa industry, to industrial hard coal mines and modern open-cast lignite mining,\u201d\n\u201cDeep geothermal energy could therefore be the next chapter for the energy regions on both sides of the Rhine.\u201d\n#### Breakdown of the funding\nThe FRELA-GEO3 will be financed in three components.\nThe Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection is supporting the program with around EUR 8.15 million through the STARK program. The state of North Rhine-Westphalia is contributing a further EUR 0.815 million to support the transition of coal regions.\nThe state of North Rhine-Westphalia in accordance with the Coal Regions Investment Act (InvKG) will provide EUR 36.54 million for the geophysical measurements, exploration drilling, and associated infrastructure. The funding according to InvKG is divided into a federal share (EUR 29.6 million) and a state share (6.94 million).\nLastly, the construction of the technical center in Weisweiler will receive around EUR 6.5 million from thhe joint funding of the Fraunhofer Society by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the Ministry of Culture and Science of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia (50% \/ 50%).\nIn total, the project will receive funding of EUR 52.005 million over four years.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Pictured at the screening are Conor Lydon, Head of Groundwater & Geothermal (UK & Ireland) at Tetra Tech, Dr Marie Cowan, Director at the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland (GSNI), Paulo Ross, Broadcaster & Presenter, and Ryan White, Director of Heat, Buildings and Climate Change at the Department for the Economy\n![ ](\n![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 4 Mar 2025\nGeoEnergy NI has published an excellent short film on the geothermal work ongoing in Northern Ireland, including efforts in education and public engagement.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n\u2018Unearthing the heat beneath our feet\u2019 the Stormont Estate, Belfast and College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise (CAFRE), Greenmount Campus near Antrim. The short film covers a wide spectrum of geothermal activities including exploration, research, and education. It also highlights the perspective of homeowners who are already benefitting from geothermal heating.\nThe GeoEnergy NI project is being delivered by the Department for the Economy (DfE), as part of the Executive\u2019s Energy Strategy, with scientific support from the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland (GSNI).\nThe project recognises that despite having huge untapped potential, geothermal energy is currently underutilised and less well known in Northern Ireland compared with other renewable energy sources. Alongside the exploration activities, the project team therefore undertook a high-profile and multi-layered engagement programme to inform the public, stakeholders, and schools about the exciting potential of geothermal energy here.\nThe documentary follows local broadcaster and geology enthusiast Paulo Ross as he explores the potential and benefits of geothermal energy \u2013 engaging with businesses, academics, and students as well as some local households who are already utilising geothermal energy. He also explores the mobile GeoEnergy Discovery Centre, which is doing a stellar job of educating young students about geothermal energy and the subsurface.\nThe data and learnings from the GeoEnergy NI project will help refine our understanding of the subsurface in Northern Ireland, which will be essential to help us unearth the heat beneath our feet as part of wider efforts to achieve net-zero energy related emissions by 2050. It will also increase awareness of the geothermal potential here and support the development of a geothermal industry, which would produce many high value jobs and skills across the region, through direct employment and spin-off industries.\nSpeaking at the launch of the short film,Ryan White, Director of Heat, Buildings and Climate Change at the Department for the Economy, said; \u201cThe GeoEnergy NI project has been an incredibly successful demonstration of Northern Ireland\u2019s geothermal potential \u2013 literally helping us unearth the heat beneath our feet. Through capturing the story of the two-year long journey in this short film, we can now reach even more people and showcase the important role geothermal energy can play in how we decarbonise our energy sector in pursuit of net zero carbon targets by 2050.\u201d\nCoinciding with the launch of the short film, GeoEnergy NI has also released its latest educational resource pack, suitable for Key Stage 4 curriculums within our schools.\nDr Marie Cowan, Director at the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland (GSNI) added; \u201cThe documentary showcases how the GeoEnergy NI team has engaged with schools, businesses, organisations and policy makers to bring about a future powered by geothermal energy. To support these efforts, GSNI have developed a range of educational resources, including our most recent Key Stage 4 teaching packs. These and the GeoEnergy NI project website provide a wealth of information about Northern Ireland\u2019s geothermal potential, so you can also explore the heat beneath your feet from the comfort of your classroom or home.\u201d\nThe \u2018Unearthing the heat beneathour feet\nSource: Email correspondence\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University 2 Oct 2025 PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![New free online course on shallow geothermal energy available on edX 30 Sep 2025 New free online course on shallow geothermal energy available on edX ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France 18 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest 15 Sep 2025 Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![TEDx talk highlights the global geothermal energy opportunity 15 Sep 2025 TEDx talk highlights the global geothermal energy opportunity ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees 12 Sep 2025 Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Your input needed \u2013 Survey on Geothermal Education Opportunities 8 Sep 2025 Your input needed \u2013 Survey on Geothermal Education Opportunities ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Free workshop on Volsung by Seequent, 6 October 2025, Zurich 5 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Free workshop on Volsung by Seequent, 6 October 2025, Zurich ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Course on Risk & uncertainty for geothermal projects; Ankara, T\u00fcrkiye 3 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Course on Risk & uncertainty for geothermal projects; Ankara, T\u00fcrkiy ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling completed for geothermal heating in Garges-l\u00e8s-Gonesse, France 28 Aug 2025 Drilling completed for geothermal heating in Garges-l\u00e8s-Gonesse, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![UK universities strengthen seismic imaging research with STRYDE nodes 27 Aug 2025 UK universities strengthen seismic imaging research with STRYDE nodes ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

A historical preservation society reached out to NREL and GTO to learn more about the potential for a closed-loop GHP to be installed in an old movie theater. The historical society\u2019s email landed with the GeoBridge team, who had already organized relevant information as part of the content development for the site. The GeoBridge team was able to respond with detailed information on heat pump sizing and pricing, relevant incentive and assistance programs, organizations and communities, and other tools, databases, and services.\n\u201cBefore GeoBridge, questions like this would get sent to multiple people, each experts in their respective fields, but it could take days to compile relevant information. Now, the answers are in one place. More importantly, the information is now easily discoverable by both people and search engines, reducing the need to send an email in the first place,\u201d Weers said.\nThe current platform is just the start. The team plans to add technical guidance on advanced geothermal topics for a variety of stakeholders, resources on permitting and regulation, and links to open-access tools developed by the national laboratories, DOE, and others in the geothermal market. GeoBridge is also looking to the future of geothermal and plans to provide information on emerging trends, technology and resource needs, hurdles, funding opportunities, and more.\n\u201cWe want GeoBridge to be useful to people across industries and are always looking for feedback on the platform through our\n\u2026 ThinkGeoEnergy is grateful for the mentioning as a valube newsletter for the geothermal sector \u2026 yet not landing on page two of that list would have been nice.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development 27 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards 23 Oct 2025 Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal Energy Forum created to drive the growth of geothermal in the UK 17 Oct 2025 Geothermal Energy Forum created to drive the growth of geothermal in the UK ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation 16 Oct 2025 China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Germany\u2019s rising heat costs highlight geothermal\u2019s edge 14 Oct 2025 Germany\u2019s rising heat costs highlight geothermal\u2019s edge ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia 3 Oct 2025 Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![T\u00fcrkiye hosts German delegation to showcase geothermal expertise, technology, and development 2 Oct 2025 T\u00fcrkiye hosts German delegation to showcase geothermal expertise, technology, and development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa 2 Oct 2025 The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Updated geothermal resource assessment released in Iceland 26 Sep 2025 Updated geothermal resource assessment released in Iceland ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![India launches geothermal policy, pilots with Iceland and Norway firms 24 Sep 2025 India launches geothermal policy, pilots with Iceland and Norway firms ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Canadian energy leaders form coalition to accelerate the deployment of deep geothermal 11 Sep 2025 Canadian energy leaders form coalition to accelerate the deployment of deep geothermal ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Bringing geothermal in from the margins \u2013 Anne Murrell, Lead of the Geothermal UK Coalition 8 Sep 2025 Bringing geothermal in from the margins \u2013 Anne Murrell, Lead of the Geothermal UK Coalition ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Qymera\u2019s has focused on a system that is designed to reduce drilling depth and costs, avoid fluid reinjection challenges and seismic risks, and provide reliable, small-scale geothermal baseload power for mining, manufacturing, and data centers.\nCETY will contribute heat-to-power expertise, integrating its Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology into the project. One of the partner companies of CETY is Exergy ORC.\nTechnology & market potential\nWhile still in early-stage demonstration, this partnership aligns with the broader trend of expanding geothermal\u2019s role in heat-intensive industries. The agreement also includes a commercial expansion option, providing access to up to 20 MW of geothermal heat or electricity for future developments.\nHowever, the long-term viability of monobore geothermal technology remains to be proven at scale. Unlike conventional geothermal power plants, this approach focuses on localized heat extraction, which may limit its broader application.\nThe pilot project will serve as a real-world test for monobore geothermal\u2019s potential as a cost-effective, small-scale baseload energy solution. If successful, it could present a new pathway for geothermal integration in industrial power markets.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![SLB and Ormat partner to fast-track development of integrated geothermal assets 27 Oct 2025 SLB and Ormat partner to fast-track development of integrated geothermal assets ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development 27 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![BLM Nevada geothermal lease sale nets over USD 9 million in bids on 86 parcels 23 Oct 2025 BLM Nevada geothermal lease sale nets over USD 9 million in bids on 86 parcels ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program 22 Oct 2025 Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards 17 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program 15 Oct 2025 California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University 2 Oct 2025 PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Turboden to deliver ORC systems for Phase II of Cape Station geothermal project in Utah 2 Oct 2025 Turboden to deliver ORC systems for Phase II of Cape Station geothermal project in Utah ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![XGS Energy completes 3000-hour operations of geothermal technology in Coso, California 30 Sep 2025 XGS Energy completes 3000-hour operations of geothermal technology in Coso, California ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells 25 Sep 2025 Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Quaise holds public demonstration of millimeter wave technology for geothermal drilling 22 Sep 2025 Quaise holds public demonstration of millimeter wave technology for geothermal drilling ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

This involved the use of three high conductivity satellite pipes which surrounds a low conductivity internal return pipe. According to the researchers\u2019 assessment, this configuration was most promising compared to other BHE designs, including coaxial, single and double U-tubes, spiral, and helical designs.\nThe schematic of the trilobular design is shown below. he development, design and formulation of this new BHE configuration is currently subject to Intellectual Property Protection (IP) patent\n![]( schematic of the trilobular geometry. In red are the three inlet pipes with 32 mm outer diameter, 26 mm inner diameter and high conductivity plastic. In blue the single outlet pipe, with 75 mm outer diameter, 54.4 mm inner diameter and low conductivity plastic. Dimensions in millimeters. (source: Urchueguia et al, 2024)\nThe main advantage of the design is its superior thermal efficiency compared to more traditional systems. This helps reduce installation and operational costs, thereby creating new opportunities for the deployment of geothermal heat pump systems, both for heating and cooling. The proposal also stands out for the use of innovative materials.\n\u201cOur work offers a more sustainable and efficient alternative in the design of heating and cooling systems,\u201d\n#### Results of thermal tests\nThermal response tests (TRT) were executed at the Geothermal Laboratory of the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Valencia to validate the performance of the novel BHE design.\nTwo different trilobular BHEs were tested \u2013 one that had expanded graphite as conductive filler, and one that had graphene to improve its thermal conductivity. The performance of the trilobular BHEs were compared to two single-U heat exchanges, one of which was made with standard PE-100 material while the other was made up of advanced plastic and installed with improved grouting.\n![]( resistance of different tested configurations. (source: Urchuegu\u00eda et al, 2024)\nThe experimental findings demonstrated that the trilobular geometry has reduced borehole resistance from value of 0.149 to 0.07 mK\/W. This allows for higher injection rate without creating an unsustainable change in ground temperature.\n#### A promising improvement for heating and cooling systems\nThe study provides some excellent insight on how the performance of geothermal heat pump systems can be improved with heat exchanger design changes and the use of innovative materials. This is particularly crucial at a time when geothermal heat pump systems are considered crucial in decarbonization efforts in cities, and have been showcased to have highly diverse applications.\n\u201cThese results have important implications for the geothermal energy industry, and offer a promising energy alternative for the future of heating and cooling buildings, contributing to the fight against climate change and the promotion of renewable energies,\u201d\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Geothermal research drilling in Strandeiland, Netherlands reaches target 1963m depth 15 Oct 2025 Geothermal research drilling in Strandeiland, Netherlands reaches target 1963m depth ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Chemicals is closer to the geothermal sector with new office in Izmir, T\u00fcrkiye 5 Sep 2025 Green Chemicals is closer to the geothermal sector with new office in Izmir, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Government backs geothermal project in Chinameca, El Salvador 5 Jun 2025 Government backs geothermal project in Chinameca, El Salvador ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Bill Gates highlights Fervo Energy\u2019s geothermal innovation 3 Jun 2025 Bill Gates highlights Fervo Energy\u2019s geothermal innovation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Bog\u00e1cs, Hungary implements networked geothermal heating system from spa water 23 Apr 2025 Bog\u00e1cs, Hungary implements networked geothermal heating system from spa water ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![World Bank announces $150 million investment for geothermal in El Salvador 31 Mar 2025 World Bank announces $150 million investment for geothermal in El Salvador ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![PLN NTT targets 198 MW development with geothermal focus 13 Mar 2025 PLN NTT targets 198 MW development with geothermal focus ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![MOU to push geothermal development in Sintiki, Greece 23 Jan 2025 MOU to push geothermal development in Sintiki, Greece ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Seismic survey for geothermal exploration to commence in Lucerne, Switzerland 8 Jan 2025 Seismic survey for geothermal exploration to commence in Lucerne, Switzerland ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Funding agreement signed for geothermal drilling in Jelenia Gora, Poland 3 Dec 2024 Funding agreement signed for geothermal drilling in Jelenia Gora, Poland ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Novel borehole heat exchanger design developed by ITACA researchers 29 Oct 2024 Novel borehole heat exchanger design developed by ITACA researchers ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling to start for geothermal greenhouse project in Simav, K\u00fctahya, T\u00fcrkiye 10 Oct 2024 Drilling to start for geothermal greenhouse project in Simav, K\u00fctahya, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Finally, in order to optimally address specific scientific and technical issues, it is envisaged to jointly establish Working Groups consisting of expert scientists from other Research Institutes and\/or Higher Education Institutions (Universities).\n\u201cI would like to thank HSGME and its General Director, Mr. Dionysios Gkoutis, who responded immediately and with interest to our request and expedited the necessary procedures for the signing of the Memorandum of Cooperation \/ Understanding. The long-standing relationship of the former IGME with Visaltia is known to everyone, both in the field of geothermal research and in other areas of geological exploration,\u201dVana Pliakou.\n\u201cThis long-standing and close relationship is today formalized and HSGME, as the successor of IGME, becomes an assistant and advisor to our Municipality in order to utilize the geothermal energy found in our area and to solve a chronic water supply problem. Both of these axes constitute pillars for the development of the area. The Municipal Authority is committed to this direction.\u201d\nA similar MoU had been signed earlier this year for the development of geothermal resources in the Municipality of Sintiki.\n#### A strong geothermal interest in Visaltia\nDr. Apostolos Arvanitis, the Head of Geothermal Energy at HSGME, provided some details on the geothermal potential in Visaltia. \u201cThe signing of the Memorandum of Cooperation gives Visaltia a great opportunity to highlight and rationally utilize the significant geothermal potential that it seems to have.\u201d\nApostolos Arvanitis described the Therma Nigrita geothermal field as one of the first low-enthalpy geothermal fields investigated by the IGME. The first geothermal boreholes had been drilled in this field from 1980-1982 and geothermal greenhouses had operated here in the 1990s. However, the whole project is now in a state of decline and abandonment, and the thermal baths of Therma are no longer operating.\nWith the MoU, development of the prospect can be revitalized. Based on the personal research of Apostolos Arvanitis, the area extending from the local community of Choumniko to the villages of Tragilos and Efkarpia is of great geothermal interest. This has been indicated by 3 geothermal wells drilled during 2000-2002 in the in the Achinos-Ivira area, identifying waters with temperatures up to 51 \u00b0C.\n\u201cOur goal is the systematic investigation of the area and its characterization as a geothermal field of local interest, in order to pave the way for the exploitation of the geothermal potential. The hydrogeological research will help, on the one hand, in solving a chronic water supply problem, and on the other hand, it will provide useful data for geothermal exploration and the possibility of implementing Geothermal Heat Pump systems,\u201dArvanitis.\n\u201cWe want to contribute to the development of Visaltia.

This project will also make Safran the first industrial player in the Paris region to install a deep geothermal plant.\n\u201cThrough this partnership, Dalkia is demonstrating that solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in industry do exist, and that geothermal energy is one of them. I salute the commitment of Safran Aircraft Engines which, through this ambitious and innovative project, will significantly reduce the carbon footprint of its site while strengthening its energy independence. It\u2019s an example that I\u2019m convinced will be followed, especially since the potential is great in the Paris region,\u201d\nWells are planned to be drilled to a depth of 1650 meters, targeting the Dogger Formation where temperatures of around 75 \u00b0C are expected. Drilling is expected to be carried out in 2025, and commissioning of the geothermal facility is targeted by late 2026. Upon operations, the heating plant will reduce carbon emissions associated with the site by 75%, equivalent to 6,500 tonnes of CO2 per year.\nThis pioneering project between Safran and the Dalkia-Arverne Drilling Services consortium is proof that industry can be both efficient and environmentally friendly and opens the way to new prospects for the decarbonization of industrial activities. A similar project is being undertaken by German aircraft engine manufacturer MTU Aero Engines at its Munich site, where the drilling of a geothermal doublet was completed last year.\n\u201cThis project bringing together leading French industrial players demonstrates the expertise of our companies and their shared commitment to decarbonizing industry through geothermal energy,\u201d\n\u201cWe are proud that Safran Aircraft Engines has chosen our expertise to equip itself with a geothermal plant, which will provide renewable, local energy, enabling it to significantly reduce its carbon footprint.

It offers energy companies, real estate investors, owners, and construction companies the means to electrify heating with geothermal heat pumps and replace fossil fuel and combustion-based alternatives.\n?\n\u201cClean, efficient, and economically viable heating solutions are now accessible to all property and energy providers interested in future-proofing their built environment. With our licensing model we help our partners build efficient geothermal energy systems for their needs,\u201d\n\u201cAlthough heat wells require an initial investment, the operating costs for the coaxial well remain low, so the investment pays for itself in the long run \u2014 through improved energy efficiency, significant financial savings and future-proofing the built environment,\nThe company has already played key roles in geothermal projects in Finland, notably the first geothermal heating plant in Vantaa and a subsurface heat storage facility in Salo.\n#### The patented coaxial system\nSalmenvaara believes coaxial geothermal energy will supersede conventional heating methods, including combustion-based heating and ground source and air-to-water source heat pumps. In 2022, QHeat started applying for patents for their technology based on coaxial flow. The patent includes an insulated pipe, with which the direction of the coaxial flow can be changed depending on the purpose of use and the entire depth of the heat well can be utilized for efficient heating and cooling.\nThe company\u2019s competitive edge stems from its superior coefficient of performance (COP). Operating data shows QHeat wells achieve a COP of up to 7 for electricity usage, significantly outperforming traditional ground source and air-water source systems, which typically only reach 2.5\u20133.5. Not only is QHeat\u2019s solution aligned with the EU Taxonomy and a worthwhile long-term investment, but it also enables property owners to achieve their net-zero goals while potentially becoming energy producers themselves.\n\u201cOur wells improve energy self-sufficiency; they are capable of powering entire building blocks,\u201d\n#### First licencing project underway in Estonia\nQHeat projects 180 licensed heat wells across several European markets by 2027. Currently operating in Finland and Estonia, QHeat plans to expand into additional Nordic, Baltic, and Central European countries within the next five years.\nIn Estonia, QHeat has recently partnered with Engineering Bureau STEIGER to deliver its patented coaxial heat well for the Geological Survey of Estonia, drilling a 700-meter borehole for low-temperature district heating and cooling. This project aims to demonstrate the efficiency of low-temperature geothermal systems and marks a key step toward sustainable energy solutions in Estonia.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Technology\n# Dominica secures $34 million financing for 10-MW geothermal power project\n!Dominica secures $34 million financing for 10-MW geothermal power project Aerial view of the site of the Dominica geothermal power project and surrounding areas (source: Dominica Geothermal Development Company)\n![ ](\n![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 6 Jan 2025\nThe Caribbean Development Bank has approved a $34.8 million loan to support the construction of a 10-MW geothermal power plant in Dominica.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nThe\nThe Caribbean island nation of Dominica has made significant strides in the past years towards the development of its first geothermal power project. Drilling and testing of the production and reinjection wells have already been completed, and more recent updates indicate that site preparation has been ongoing for the power plant construction that is expected to start by early 2025.\nThe 10-MW geothermal power project is set to make a huge impact in the costs and reliability of electricity supply in Dominica. Currently, Dominica imports over 90% of its energy, mainly in the form of fossil fuels. Approximately 70% of the country\u2019s electricity is diesel-generated, driving up energy costs and hindering business growth and progress towards key Sustainable Development Goals. Early studies suggest that the island\u2019s geothermal potential could provide electrical power capacity up to 50-times the current peak demand of approximately 18 MW.\nThe Government of Dominica has also engaged with a company from Trinidad and Tobago to undertake a pre-feasibility study for the production of green ammonia using geothermal energy.\n\u201cThis plant will go a long way in helping Dominica achieve its sustainable energy goals and transition from fossil fuel-based electricity generation to entirely renewable sources,\u201d\n#### Supporting energy security in the Caribbean region\nThis project is funded under\nCDB\u2019s funding \u2013 with resources from the Inter-American Development Bank (through the Green Climate Fund), and Government of Canada through the Global Affairs Canada \u2013 covers 51% of the total project costs of approximately USD68 million, with the CARICOM Development Fund (CDF) contributing 22%, and the remainder as equity from the GPC.\nMr Joseph Williams, Coordinator of the CDB\u2019s Sustainable Energy Unit, noted that the approved funding for Dominica represents an important milestone and highlighted the importance of development financing in geothermal projects in small island developing states, given the high risk and national governments\u2019 fiscal and human capacity constraints.\nIn addition to Dominica, other OECS nations have received support under the GeoSmart Initiative. A USD9.4 million grant has been approved for test drilling in Grenada, while St Kitts and Nevis received USD 17 million in funding towards the drilling of production wells on the island of Nevis. CDB previously provided USD27 million to support completed geothermal exploration in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\nTapping the geothermal potential of the OECS countries helps strengthen the energy security of the region by reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels, while also reducing carbon emissions and contributing to global efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change. It also helps increase the competitiveness of these economies by supplying affordable and reliable electricity to consumers, households, and businesses.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![LATAM Geothermal Congress declares a path forward for the region\u2019s geothermal future 21 Oct 2025 LATAM Geothermal Congress declares a path forward for the region\u2019s geothermal future ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![El Salvador legislation approves Geothermal Energy Law 11 Sep 2025 El Salvador legislation approves Geothermal Energy Law ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![New bill proposes private investment in El Salvador geothermal sector 4 Sep 2025 New bill proposes private investment in El Salvador geothermal sector ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![CDB announces financial close for Dominica geothermal power project 2 Sep 2025 CDB announces financial close for Dominica geothermal power project ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 LATAM Geothermal Congress, El Salvador, 22-25 September 2025 29 Aug 2025 Registration open \u2013 LATAM Geothermal Congress, El Salvador, 22-25 September 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![St Kitts and Nevis receives five bids in geothermal production drilling tender 20 Aug 2025 St Kitts and Nevis receives five bids in geothermal production drilling tender ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Nicaragua revokes Momotombo geothermal concession over money laundering charges 15 Aug 2025 Nicaragua revokes Momotombo geothermal concession over money laundering charges ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![LaGeo celebrates 50 years of Ahuachapan geothermal power station in El Salvador 31 Jul 2025 LaGeo celebrates 50 years of Ahuachapan geothermal power station in El Salvador ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![OECS deliberates acquiring geothermal drill rig to be shared across Caribbean countries 22 Jul 2025 OECS deliberates acquiring geothermal drill rig to be shared across Caribbean countries ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Global Sustainable Islands Summit highlights the geothermal ambitions of Nevis 30 May 2025 Global Sustainable Islands Summit highlights the geothermal ambitions of Nevis ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Grenada plans geothermal exploration drilling by 2026 28 Apr 2025 Grenada plans geothermal exploration drilling by 2026 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dominica reports progress on construction of 10-MW geothermal power plant 23 Apr 2025 Dominica reports progress on construction of 10-MW geothermal power plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The solution prioritises environmental sustainability, using water as the working fluid in all sub-systems and anticipates improvements in cost-efficiency for geothermal application developments.\nThe expected outcome is a substantial increase in the deployment of geothermal resources for heat and cold generation, offering enhanced efficiency, less environmental hazards, portability and more societal acceptance. Additionally, the solution seeks to enable the use of geothermal energy sources in regions with or without significant hydrothermal reservoirs, seamlessly integrated with the industrial setting and showcasing adaptability for widespread use. Furthermore, the solution is planned to be integrated with additional renewable energy sources to improve grid stability and power supply dependability, making it suitable for a variety of geological structural conditions, including district heating networks.\nBy integrating with thermal energy storage systems, the GEOSYN technology will increase adaptability and operate with a variety of thermal sources, such as waste heat and geothermal sources at varying temperatures. A demonstration campaign will be held in a dairy facility in Italy to showcase and validate the results of the GEOSYN project, and virtual case studies (such as low carbon cement plant in Ukraine) will be assessed to demonstrate the solution\u2019s applicability.\nThe deployment of the GEOSYN innovation will be supported by awareness-raising and social acceptance campaigns to enhance engagement with civil society. The GEOSYN will engage with policy makers to incorporate the geothermal deployment in local, regional and national policies. Additionally, GEOSYN will inspire young women through the use of female role models to study and take up careers in entrepreneurship and geothermal H&C. Finally, environmental and financial benefit examples of the proposed technology in diverse contexts will demonstrate the affordability of geothermal H&C for production processes.\nSource: Email correspondence\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The two bills referred to here are the Harnessing Energy At Thermal Sources (HEATS) Act (H.R. 7409) and the Committing Leases for Energy Access Now (CLEAN) Act. (H.R 1449), both bipartisan in nature.\nBoth bills will soon be deliberated by the Senate. Several efforts to craft a pro-geothermal legislative framework are currently ongoing in parallel in the US, both in the federal and state levels.\n#### The HEATS Act\nThe HEATS Act is is sponsored by Rep. Young Kim (R-CA-40) and supported by Rep. John Duarte (R-CA-13). The bill aims to expedite geothermal development by clarifying that geothermal operators do not need a federal drilling permit for wells that are on state and private land given that the subsurface geothermal estate is less than 50% federal.\n\u201cOperators must still go through a rigorous permitting process at the state level, but they will no longer be burdened by the federal process, allowing us to harness this untapped energy source faster,\u201d\nThe bill also states that such geothermal exploration and production activity is not considered a major federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and should not trigger the NEPA\u2019s environmental review requirements.\nMoreover, the bill exempts geothermal activities from the consultation requirements under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and review requirements under the National Historic Preservation Act unless the state in which the activity occurs does not have a state law that addresses the preservation of historic properties.\n#### The CLEAN Act\nThe CLEAN Act by Rep. Russ Fulcher (R-ID-1) amends the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 to requite the Department of the Interior to hold geothermal lease sales every years, instead of the current two-year interval. Moreover, it requires the department to hold a replacement lease sale within the year should one be canceled.\nIn addition, this bill requires Interior to notify an applicant whether or not its application for a geothermal drilling permit is complete within 30 days of receiving the application. If Interior determines that the application is complete, then it must issue a final decision on the application within 30 days of the date Interior sent the notification.\n\u201cAs nearly 90% of our nation\u2019s geothermal resources are located on federally managed lands, I introduced the CLEAN Act to remove red tape and require the Department of Interior to increase lease opportunities to bolster the exploration and development of this critical resource,\u201d\n\u201cThis legislation is not only vital to reducing our reliance on foreign adversaries but meeting America\u2019s growing energy demands. I am very pleased to see it head to the Senate.\u201d\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area 27 Oct 2025 Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program 15 Oct 2025 California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Arup 13 Oct 2025 Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Aru ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brazil approves creation of a National Geothermal Energy Program 1 Oct 2025 Brazil approves creation of a National Geothermal Energy Program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Growing geothermal momentum in focus at the 3rd Budapest Geothermal Energy Summit 30 Sep 2025 Growing geothermal momentum in focus at the 3rd Budapest Geothermal Energy Summit ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells 25 Sep 2025 Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GEOENERG\u00cdA presents proposals for draft Royal Decree on heating and cooling networks in Spain 19 Sep 2025 GEOENERG\u00cdA presents proposals for draft Royal Decree on heating and cooling networks in Spain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![India publishes National Policy setting a framework for geothermal development 17 Sep 2025 India publishes National Policy setting a framework for geothermal development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![El Salvador legislation approves Geothermal Energy Law 11 Sep 2025 El Salvador legislation approves Geothermal Energy Law ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Bringing geothermal in from the margins \u2013 Anne Murrell, Lead of the Geothermal UK Coalition 8 Sep 2025 Bringing geothermal in from the margins \u2013 Anne Murrell, Lead of the Geothermal UK Coalition ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Most of these operations are taking place in the Paris Basin and in the Aquitaine Basin, with none in southeastern France, despite its potential geothermal resources and the demand for decarbonized heat for both residential heating networks and industry use.\nTherefore, to foster the development of deep geothermal project in southeastern France, an exploration campaign was started targeting approximately 1000 km2\nThe area is well known for its lignite resources and has also been explored, without success, for oil and gas (exploration wells and seismic data shot before 1980). Despite the geoscientific data available, significant uncertainties remain regarding the existence and characteristics of a deep geothermal resource. The main unknowns include the geometry and depth of the target reservoirs (carbonates from the lower cretaceous), properties of the reservoirs and characteristics of the water resource (presence, recharge dynamics and exit mechanism).\n#### A comprehensive exploration program\nTo help assess these elements and uncertainties a comprehensive exploration program was drafted and is currently being executed.\n![]( lines of the seismic survey done around the Etang de Berre in southeastern France (source: Geoscan Arc)\nIt started with the acquisition in autumn 2024 of over 320 km of modern broadband 2D reflection seismic data on land and on the Etang de Berre to complement the legacy and help with the construction of structural model of the zone of interest. This geophysical campaign \u2013 financed by public funds \u2013 is referenced in the article of \u201c\nTo complement the geophysics, geological field work to collect structural information and rock samples from analogues as well as a study of the karstification is being undertaken now. The collected data will help with understanding of the reservoir properties and possible fluid flow circulation at depth. The construction of a geological model integrating all the data will take place by the end of the year with an expected end of the project and result delivery to the public, authorities and industry by mid 2026.\nSource: Email correspondence\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

(source: GNS Science)\n![ ](\n![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 28 Aug 2024\nStudies done by GNS Science show that co-injecting CO2 with geothermal brine mitigates silica scaling while making geothermal power generation CO2-neutral.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nLab-scale tests done by New Zealand-based research institute\nUnder current practices in most parts of the world, geothermal power stations emit naturally occurring CO2 that is initially dissolved in the geothermal fluid as part of the power generation process. Although a minuscule amount, the CO2 emitted means that geothermal electricity generation is not completely free from carbon emissions and the cost of carbon tax.\nThere are already several efforts worldwide to re-inject this CO2 into the geothermal reservoir. This has the potential to turn geothermal generators from CO2 emitters to CO2 neutral. A notable example of this is the Ngawha Geothermal Power Station by Top Energy, also in New Zealand, which has achieved 100% reinjection of non-condensible gases as part of the Ngawha Carbon Zero Project. However, there is still a knowledge gap on how a geothermal reservoir would respond to long-term CO2 re-injection.\n#### Results of lab tests\nTests were done using the novel dual-stage autoclave method by GNS Science. Aside from the goal of re-injecting CO2, the theory is that CO2 forms carbonic acid upon dissolution in the fluid. This makes the brine more acidic and helps prevent silica scaling in the reservoir. Scaling in the formation is a particularly big problem in re-injection wells, as it may reduce injectivity and eventually necessitate the drilling of new wells.\nThe experiment was done using greywacke, a major reservoir rock type found in the Taupo Volcanic Zone. The control experiment showed that moderate silica scaling occurs with standard geothermal brine, and that this scaling is enhanced with the introduction of calcite. However, using brine charged with 2000 mg of CO2\/kg brine resulted in nearly zero scaling.\n#### CO2 as a natural cleaning agent\nThe test results showed that the accelerated removal of calcite from the rock is an important side-effect of co-injection CO2 with geothermal brine. As a \u201cwin-win-win\u201d solution, the co-injection of captured CO2 with the geothermal brine can:\n* lower the emissions, therefore the carbon tax, for geothermal operators\n* make the expended geothermal brine that flows into the subsurface retain its acidity, which slows silica scaling in the rock\n* at high concentrations, accelerate the removal of calcite from the rock, meaning that the CO2 is acting as a \u201ccleaning agent\u201d because it removes the cause of silica scaling.\nCo-injection can thus eliminate carbon emissions while improving the efficiency of production operations and the sustainability of the geothermal reservoir.\n#### Next steps\nSite-specific studies were funded by both domestic and international geothermal operators, and have led to the formulation of the novel concept of CO2 as a silica anti-scalant. The research done by GNS Science was supported by the Strategic Science Investment Fund (SSIF) Programmes Contract C05X1702 granted by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE).\nEncouraged by the promising results, two New Zealand geothermal power generators have requested further experimentation. The goal is to further explore the effects of CO2 co-injection, potentially leading to more efficient and sustainable geothermal power production.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya 28 Oct 2025 Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area 27 Oct 2025 Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines 22 Oct 2025 EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia 20 Oct 2025 Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia 17 Oct 2025 Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation 16 Oct 2025 China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated 16 Oct 2025 Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia 8 Oct 2025 Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia 3 Oct 2025 Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

This is a project that will be implemented by an agreement signed in late 2024.\nMayor Jutta Steinruck expressed relief for the favorable vote, but also emphasized that information on the project must be provided to the public. \u201cThe questions from citizens show that it is something new, something unknown. We have to react to it.\u201d\nThe two partners plan to jointly develop a geothermal heat project to supply BASF\u2019s Verbund site, as well as to evaluate the feasibility of constructing a lithium extraction plant within the BASF site to produce lithium from geothermal brine. As a preparatory step, a seismic survey will be done to identify the possible reservoir for the geothermal resource. Vulcan estimates that the comprehensive investigations will cost a total of EUR 10-15 million.\nSome members of the city council criticized the short-term scheduling of the exploration activities, stating that there had been no time beforehand for the group to discuss the topic of geothermal energy. However, the decision had to be made as seismic measurements would no longer be possible during the birds\u2019 breeding season in spring.\nAccording to the initial project timeline published by the project partners, the upcoming activities will involve a 2D seismic survey. This can then be followed up by 3D seismic surveys in the 2025\/2026 winter season to identify well site locations.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Technology\n# Fervo Energy\u2019s planned IPO: key takeaways & market context\n!Fervo Energy\u2019s planned IPO: key takeaways & market context Tim Latimer, CEO of Fervo Energy at one of the company\u2019s development sites (source: Fervo Energy)\n![ ](\n![ ]( Alexander Richter 14 Mar 2025\nFervo Energy\u2019s IPO ambitions highlight geothermal\u2019s growth potential, but past public market cycles and evolving business models provide key lessons.\n![](\n![](\n![](\nFervo Energy\u2019s potential IPO and multi-billion-dollar valuation discussions mark a pivotal moment for geothermal energy investment. In news shared by\nIf one looks at this news, I wanted to share my key observations and an analysis of the broader implications for the sector:\n1. Venture capital & technology-driven investment\nIn a unique financing mix, Fervo Energy\u2019s stands out with venture capital investors such as Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC and Congruent Ventures, institutional investments through e.g. CPP Investmenbts and CalSTRS, but \u2013 and importantly \u2013 strategic backing from oil & gas through Devon Energy and Liberty Energy (the latter investing under now U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, then CEO of Liberty Energy).\nWith having secured USD 556 milllion in equity financing and USD 220 million in debt financing, the company is clearly positioned itself as a leader in next-generation geothermal. What makes Fervo particularly interesting in this context is here the focus on utilizing Enhanced\/ Engineered Geothermal Systems (EGS) technology tapping learnings from the oil & gas sector, pairing it with traditional utility-drive geothermal development on scale and \u2013 building partnerships with power offtakers right from the beginning, ensuring revenue stability before development.\n2. Large-scale project development & demand growth\nFrom its initial pilot-scale project, a 3 MW project in Nevada to the now full-scale commercial development in Nevada and Utah.\nThe 115 MW geothermal project in Nevada is part of a partnership with utility NV Energy to supply power to Google\u2018s data centers in the state, specifically in Hendersen (near Las Vegas) and Storey County (east of Reno, Nevada).\nThe larger project in Utah, known as Cape Station in Beaver County, Utah northeast of Milford is set up as a 400 MW project being developed in stages with the 100 MW Phase 1 planned to deliver power as early as 2026, and the remaining 300 MW Phase 2 to then be operational by 2028.\nThe rapid growth of U.S. data centers has fueled demand for clean, firm power, and Fervo has been instrumental in positioning geothermal as a key solution. We recently published an article on the expected power demand and the potential role for geothermal referring to a report released by Rhodium Group.\n3. The U.S. Market & Policy Landscape\nMaybe surprisingly, geothermal has received unexpected support from the Trump administration, particularly through the energy \u201carticle on a recent geothermal event by ProjectInnerspace and CRES in Washington, there are risks.\nThe control by the Republican Party of the Congress in Washington poses risks to clean energy tax credits from the 2022 climate law (\n4. Business model uncertainty: portfolio development vs. hidden champions\nUnlike wind and solar, geothermal continues to lack a dominant project development model. Fervo Energy \u2013 to the best of my understanding \u2013 seems to balance scaling as a technology-driven power developer paired with large-scale development. How and if it will expand into a portfolio expansion model will have to be seen. The questions is also if EGS proves viable across different geologies, ensuring replicability at scale. For now it seems EGS can expand geothermal development beyond the geographically limited conventional hydrothermal resources.\nWhile scaling geothermal technology is essential, the business model for large-scale, multi-project development remains unclear. Will a \u201chidden champion\u201d model emerge \u2013 where companies focus on specific high-value markets, such as heating, industrial applications rather than widespread portfolio growth?\n5. Lessons from past geothermal public listings\nThe now planned IPO by Fervo Energy draws comparision to past geothermal listings on global stock markets, many of which struggled to scale \u2013 and mostly do not exist anymore.\nHistorical Public Market Trends:\n* Australia (ASX, 2005\u20132015) \u2013 Geodynamics, PetraTherm and others pursued EGS but faced high costs, technical hurdles and lack of support by the Australian government. Here an interesting article by\n* Canada (TSX, 2005\u20132015) \u2013 Magma Energy (later Alterra Power), Ram Power, Nevada Geothermal Power, Sierra Geothermal Power, Western GeoPower \u2013 all failed to establish scalable und sustainable models. An\nSo what is different now? There is capital backing from both venture and institutional investors, a surging demand from AI and data centers, and EGS technology has matured with the expertise gained by the oil & gas sector.\n6. Europe\u2019s geothermal heating boom: a different investment model\nWhile seemingly, most of the companies making the news on technology development for geothermal and investments are U.S. based, there are European players with long-term perspectives. Unlike the U.S. power-focused model, Europe is prioritizing district heating, both due to decarbonization efforts but also a strong push for energy security following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, with European countries trying to curb their dependency on imported Russian gas.\nThere are a large number of companies pushing geothermal development for heating in Europe, Eavor Technologies \u2013 a Canadian player \u2013 is developing heat (and power) projects parallel to commercially prove their closed-loop technology, oil company OMV with heat development in Austria and investor in Eavor. Interesting in the context of Fervo and its plans, are though\nWhy does this European focus on heating matter?\nDevelopment of heating projects can be seen as lower risk and potentially faster payback then technologically complex deep geothermap projects, as it targets shallower and lower temperatore resources broadening the geographic opportunities of geothermal deployment. There is large regulatory and municipal support (and demand) for clean heating projects with limited alternatives to geothermal energy. Furthermore the market structure with district heating networks, and ambitious large-scale plans to expand these networks, provide stable revenue streams with long-term utility contracts.\nAs geothermal investment expands beyond power, Fervo\u2019s U.S. focus may contrast with Europe\u2019s heating-driven strategy, opening opportunities for divergent business models.\nFinal thoughts: What this means for the future of geothermal\nThe indication of an IPO by Fervo Energy signals that venture capital (and institutional investment) sees real potential in scaling geothermal. There are though some challenges remaining, such as proving scalability across diverse geologies, navigating uncertain policy & tax incentives, long project development time frames, and \u2013 crucial \u2013 defining a sustainable business model \u2013 pure developer vs. integrated energy player.\nIf geothermal can achieve both technological breakthroughs and financial scale, Fervo\u2019s IPO could mark a turning point for geothermal energy as a firm, clean energy solution \u2013 particularly as U.S. data center energy demand skyrockets.\nRead the article on\nDisclaimer: The author is a former employee of Innargi.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program 22 Oct 2025 Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya 6 Oct 2025 Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![T\u00fcrkiye hosts German delegation to showcase geothermal expertise, technology, and development 2 Oct 2025 T\u00fcrkiye hosts German delegation to showcase geothermal expertise, technology, and development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Cornish Lithium raises \u00a335m equity funding to advance UK lithium and geothermal projects 29 Sep 2025 Cornish Lithium raises \u00a335m equity funding to advance UK lithium and geothermal projects ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Project InnerSpace launches geothermal cold storage project in India under funding program 25 Sep 2025 Project InnerSpace launches geothermal cold storage project in India under funding program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First Gen \\(EDC\\) ventures into Indonesia with geothermal investment strategy 24 Sep 2025 First Gen (EDC) ventures into Indonesia with geothermal investment strategy ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Startup developing CO2-based geothermal system completes seed funding round 23 Sep 2025 Startup developing CO2-based geothermal system completes seed funding round ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lithium de France secures \u20ac40 million funding for pre-industrial phase of geothermal lithium project 23 Sep 2025 Lithium de France secures \u20ac40 million funding for pre-industrial phase of geothermal lithium proje ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Altamin secures grant for research on critical minerals from geothermal brine in Italy 22 Sep 2025 Altamin secures grant for research on critical minerals from geothermal brine in Italy ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

This initiative aligns with Germany\u2019s broader efforts to transition to renewable heating and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.\nThe exploration phase, now underway, includes geological surveys and preliminary drilling to assess the underground conditions for geothermal heat extraction. Experts will evaluate the thermal and structural properties of the subsurface to determine the feasibility of deep geothermal utilization. Following the exploration phase, detailed analysis will guide the project\u2019s next steps, including drilling and infrastructure planning. If successful, the geothermal plant could significantly contribute to the region\u2019s heating supply, supporting both residential and industrial needs.\nThe project is backed by two experienced geothermal energy firms from France: TLS Geothermics and Kalyosphere. The kickoff event saw key figures from the industry participating in the ceremonial groundbreaking, including S\u00e9bastien Delannoy from TLS Geothermics and Gitta Wahl from Bestec, the company responsible for coordinating the geological surveys.\nAccording to Mathieu Auxietre, CEO of TLS Geothermics, investing in this technology is not only about reducing CO? emissions but also about strengthening energy security, fostering economic growth, and creating local jobs. Nicolas Dall\u2019asta, a geologist at TLS Geothermics, highlighted Saxony\u2019s promising geological conditions for geothermal energy, emphasizing that initial studies indicate strong potential in the Auerbach region.\nAlain Rabaute, geologist at Kalyosphere, explained that state-of-the-art geophysical and geological survey techniques are being used to evaluate underground conditions, all while adhering to the highest environmental and safety standards.\nThe exploration area spans nearly 850 square kilometers, covering parts of the Vogtlandkreis, Erzgebirgskreis, and the Zwickau district. Over 250 measurement points have been designated for geophysical studies. Special sensors, embedded 30 centimeters into the ground, will collect data over the next one to two months to analyze geological structures. These non-intrusive \u201csilent measurements\u201d assess natural ground vibrations as well as electrical and magnetic fields, ensuring no disruptions to local communities or the environment.\nJens Scharff, Mayor of Auerbach, expressed strong support for the project, emphasizing that leveraging local geothermal resources could provide long-term energy security for the region.\nThe data collected from this phase will be analyzed over the coming months, determining the next steps for deep geothermal development in the Ostvogtland region. With the involvement of experienced companies, strong local backing, and the use of cutting-edge technology, this project represents a significant step toward sustainable heating in Saxony.\nSource: Our German partner website\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![\u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 28 Oct 2025 \u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Upon completion, the park will move under the ownership of the city of Calipatria.\nBean further explained that the funding application for the geothermal part falls under Category K of the funding program which supports \u201cenhancement, restoration, or preservation of natural resources.\u201d The loan is designed to support communities that have geothermal by funding projects in the areas of socioeconomic impact, public service infrastructure, and lithium initiatives.\n#### A demand for geothermal training\nReception to the proposal for a geothermal-themed park has been mixed, with critics stating that the funding can be better spent on other things.\nWilliam Cooper, Executive Director of The Becoming Project in California, stated that community members are not asking for \u201ca monument to geothermal in Calipatria.\u201d Instead, people are asking for some actual training in the field of geothermal. \u201cThings like these are just going to give the community more information about geothermal. The community of Calipatria has information about geothermal. It\u2019s been there for 40 years\nHowever, the initiative has received a healthy amount of support from local legislators and industry partners including Imperial Irrigation District, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the North End Alliance, and Geothermal Rising.\nSupervisor Ryan Kelley responded to the criticism, stating that the funding\u2019s requirements meant that it can only be applied to specific types of geothermal-related projects. Other community needs, such as those for infrastructure, are outside of the scope of the funding program.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University 2 Oct 2025 PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![New free online course on shallow geothermal energy available on edX 30 Sep 2025 New free online course on shallow geothermal energy available on edX ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France 18 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest 15 Sep 2025 Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![TEDx talk highlights the global geothermal energy opportunity 15 Sep 2025 TEDx talk highlights the global geothermal energy opportunity ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees 12 Sep 2025 Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Your input needed \u2013 Survey on Geothermal Education Opportunities 8 Sep 2025 Your input needed \u2013 Survey on Geothermal Education Opportunities ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Free workshop on Volsung by Seequent, 6 October 2025, Zurich 5 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Free workshop on Volsung by Seequent, 6 October 2025, Zurich ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Course on Risk & uncertainty for geothermal projects; Ankara, T\u00fcrkiye 3 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Course on Risk & uncertainty for geothermal projects; Ankara, T\u00fcrkiy ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling completed for geothermal heating in Garges-l\u00e8s-Gonesse, France 28 Aug 2025 Drilling completed for geothermal heating in Garges-l\u00e8s-Gonesse, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![UK universities strengthen seismic imaging research with STRYDE nodes 27 Aug 2025 UK universities strengthen seismic imaging research with STRYDE nodes ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Geothermal energy also helped prevent $500 million worth of natural gas imports.\n#### $1.2 billion economic impact in 2023\nIn the first 10 months of 2024, geothermal energy production accounted for 3.2% of total energy generation, generating $1 billion in revenue. By the end of the year, this figure is expected to reach the 2023 level of $1.2 billion.\nSent\u00fcrk noted that a total of $5 billion has been invested in T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s geothermal energy sector to date. He emphasized the sector\u2019s use of up to 70% locally produced equipment, low land requirements, and contributions to local employment. Sent\u00fcrk highlighted geothermal energy\u2019s critical role in reducing energy dependency due to its ability to provide uninterrupted power generation.\nGeothermal energy is not limited to electricity production alone. According to JESDER data:\n* 165,500 homes are heated with geothermal resources,\n* 700 hectares of greenhouse areas are supported,\n* 18,000 hectares of agricultural specialty zones are under development,\n* An annual capacity of 5,000 tons of fruit and vegetable drying is provided.\nExpressing their desire to further capitalize on the sector\u2019s potential, Sent\u00fcrk said: \u201cGeothermal energy not only contributes to the local economy but also plays a strategic role in achieving our country\u2019s energy independence.

The discovery of two more low-temperature zones within the city limits is a very positive outcome, as the need for energy for domestic heating and economic activity in the area is constantly growing in line with the growing society.\n#### Results from drilling\nDrilling of research wells in Kjalarnes started in 2022, already indicating that there is a strong temperature anomaly at the far end of Brimnes. It was then decided to drill two research wells to depths of about 800 meters. This autumn, the first well, SV-08, was drilled and confirmed hot water at 100 \u00b0C. A preliminary test also indicated flowrates of almost 40 L\/s.\nFurther tests will still be needed to confirm the capacity of the new system, but early estimates indicate that it can produce up to 200 L\/s of hot water in Brimnes. This corresponds to the needs of about 10,000 people.\nIn Geldinganes, well R-44 was drilled this November and tapped hot water at 90 \u00b0C and flowrates are estimated at about 20 L\/s.\n#### Future plans and other exploration work\nWhen the work in SV-08 in Brimnes is completed in the next few days, the rig will then move 300 meters south to the location of well SV-09. More wells are planned to be drilled in the coming years, but if all goes to plant, water from Brimnes can be introduced to the system within 3 to 5 years.\nA long-term production test will be done on well R-44 in Geldinganes once drilling has been completed. Information from this test will then be instrumental in planning the drilling of future wells.\nVeitur is also drilling research wells in other areas to better map where geothermal energy can be found. When the drilling of well R-44 in Kjalarnes is finished, the drill will move east to Laugalandi in Holtum, where a well will be drilled that will hopefully be used to increase production for Rang\u00e1rveita.\nVeitur also has geothermal prospecting projects underway in several areas where thin and shallow wells are drilled for geothermal prospecting.\nExtensive geothermal research has been carried out in Kjalarnes and Laugalandi in recent years, and the results of those studies were used to locate the wells we are drilling now this fall and winter in Brimnes and Laugalandi in Holtum. Geothermal research is currently underway at Borg \u00e1 M\u00fdrum and \u00c1lftanes, and in the near future research drilling will begin in \u00c1sahreppi. Exploration wells are also being drilled at the southern side of Grafarvog (at S\u00e6varh\u00f6f\u00f0a and St\u00f3rh\u00f6f\u00f0a).\nVeitur\u2019s plans include following up the exploratory drilling that has been done this year at \u00c1lftanes and Borg \u00e1 M\u00fdrum with deeper drilling that will determine whether usable geothermal energy can be found there.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

An array of geothermal heat pumps distribute the energy throughout the building, maintaining temperature and even providing heat to an outdoor pool.\n![]( of geothermal system at 1515 Surf, Coney Island, New York (source: 1515 Surf)\nThe design and installation of the geothermal system was done by\nAlthough 1515 Surf currently holds the title as the biggest geothermal installation in New York City, there is already a project being developed that aims to snatch this title \u2013 an 834-unit residential development in Greenpoint that is expected to open by 2026. The team of LCOR, Studio V, and EcoSave have also started work on a smaller building in Rochelle which will also have a geothermal system. This is expected to be completed by next year.\nEncouraged by financial incentives from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority and the Clean Heat, there is clearly a geothermal movement that is gaining momentum in New York. Work is currently ongoing for 1 Java Street in Brooklyn, a mixed-use development that will incorporate a geothermal heat pump system. With the passing of a law earlier this year that makes it easier to drill geothermal wells beyond 500 feet depth, deep geothermal systems are likely to have a more prominent presence in New York moving forward.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![SLB and Ormat partner to fast-track development of integrated geothermal assets 27 Oct 2025 SLB and Ormat partner to fast-track development of integrated geothermal assets ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development 27 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![BLM Nevada geothermal lease sale nets over USD 9 million in bids on 86 parcels 23 Oct 2025 BLM Nevada geothermal lease sale nets over USD 9 million in bids on 86 parcels ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program 22 Oct 2025 Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards 17 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program 15 Oct 2025 California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University 2 Oct 2025 PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Turboden to deliver ORC systems for Phase II of Cape Station geothermal project in Utah 2 Oct 2025 Turboden to deliver ORC systems for Phase II of Cape Station geothermal project in Utah ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![XGS Energy completes 3000-hour operations of geothermal technology in Coso, California 30 Sep 2025 XGS Energy completes 3000-hour operations of geothermal technology in Coso, California ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells 25 Sep 2025 Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Quaise holds public demonstration of millimeter wave technology for geothermal drilling 22 Sep 2025 Quaise holds public demonstration of millimeter wave technology for geothermal drilling ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Technology\n# Geothermal Rising expands into Canada with acquisition of CanGEA\n!Geothermal Rising expands into Canada with acquisition of CanGEA CanGEA & Geothermal Rising acquisition\n![ ](\n![ ]( Alexander Richter 20 Jan 2025\nWith its acquisition of the Canadian Geothermal Energy Association (CanGEA), Geothermal Rising establishes a foothold in Canada giving a stronger voice to geothermal in both countries.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nLast week, it was reported that U.S.-based geothermal association Geothermal Rising has acquired the Canadian Geothermal Energy Association (CanGEA).\nWith the acquisition, CanGEA will be renamed to Geothermal Rising Canada. The transaction was supported by the Boards of both organizations, as well as the member companies of CanGEA.\nGeothermal Rising Canada will carry on the pivotal work of CanGEA. \u201cI\u2019m most proud of how we provided opportunities to the next generation of energy workers, often in support of their goals to transition to green energy. We empowered dozens of youth and underrepresented groups via employment and mentorship at CanGEA,\u201d stated former CanGEA Managing Director and Chair Alison Thompson.\nCanGEA has successfully influenced and changed federal and provincial laws and regulations for nearly 2 decades. CanGEA has had a mission to empower the geothermal community and promote geothermal technology, same as Geothermal Rising. We are thrilled to announce that in 2025, CanGEA is becoming Geothermal Rising Canada!\n\u201cWe are grateful for the dedication and impact CanGEA has made with remarkable support from volunteers, not least of which are the organization\u2019s Board members: Alison Thompson, Brian Toohey, and Donovan Nielsen,\u201d said Dr. Bryant Jones, Executive Director of GR. \u201cWith GR assuming control of Geothermal Rising Canada (formerly CanGEA), we can leverage resources to better and more loudly amplify the research conducted by governments, pilot projects carried out by universities, and new developments and technologies advanced by industry.\u201d\nThe momentum is building for the geothermal industry in Canada. The federal and provincial governments are taking notice, the World Geothermal Congress will be held in Canada in 2026, and Canadian geothermal companies are making headlines in Canada and around the globe.\n\u201cGeothermal energy is gaining significant momentum worldwide, with over $47 billion invested in 2023 and supporting 140,000 jobs globally. Now, more than ever, it is crucial to unite efforts and foster collaboration across the entire geothermal value chain in both Canada and the United States to build on this momentum. I am thrilled about the tremendous opportunity to leverage the expertise, resources, and influence of Geothermal Rising to enhance and scale the impactful policy and regulatory work that CanGEA has championed for the past two decades in Canada,\u201d said Jeanine Vany, GR Board member and Executive Vice President and co-founder of Eavor Technologies.\n\u201cGeothermal Rising has effectively enhanced the visibility of geothermal heat and power technologies across the United States. The collaboration between Geothermal Rising and CanGEA will enable this important work to extend into Canada,\u201d stated Emily Smejkal, a Science Fellow at the Cascade Institute and Board member of Geothermal Canada. \u201cAlthough Canada\u2019s geothermal resources are well-documented scientifically, their utilization has been limited. Geothermal Rising\u2019s expertise in promoting geothermal energy in the United States will be invaluable in developing a robust industry in Canada. The establishment of Geothermal Rising Canada marks an exciting advancement for the geothermal sector.\u201d\nThrough this merger, Geothermal Rising will organize knowledge sharing opportunities in Canada, empower Indigenous voices through the Indigenous Geothermal Symposium, expand the Regional Interest Group (RIG) initiative, familiarize external audiences about geothermal energy (such as the media, investors, and policymakers), and support the work of the International Geothermal Association and Geothermal Canada to host a successful WGC 2026 in Calgary!\n\u201cGeothermal energy development is a North American opportunity. It makes a lot of sense to have one body, Geothermal Rising, as the voice to represent an industry looking to grow its footprint,\u201d said Lisa Mueller, GR Board member-elect, and CEO of FutEra Energy, the first geothermal developer in Canada to have electrons on the grid.\nSource:\nDisclaimer: The Author was Executive Director of CanGEA 2011-2012 and Board Member of CanGEA 2011 to 2024.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development 27 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards 23 Oct 2025 Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal Energy Forum created to drive the growth of geothermal in the UK 17 Oct 2025 Geothermal Energy Forum created to drive the growth of geothermal in the UK ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation 16 Oct 2025 China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Germany\u2019s rising heat costs highlight geothermal\u2019s edge 14 Oct 2025 Germany\u2019s rising heat costs highlight geothermal\u2019s edge ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia 3 Oct 2025 Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![T\u00fcrkiye hosts German delegation to showcase geothermal expertise, technology, and development 2 Oct 2025 T\u00fcrkiye hosts German delegation to showcase geothermal expertise, technology, and development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa 2 Oct 2025 The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Updated geothermal resource assessment released in Iceland 26 Sep 2025 Updated geothermal resource assessment released in Iceland ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![India launches geothermal policy, pilots with Iceland and Norway firms 24 Sep 2025 India launches geothermal policy, pilots with Iceland and Norway firms ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Canadian energy leaders form coalition to accelerate the deployment of deep geothermal 11 Sep 2025 Canadian energy leaders form coalition to accelerate the deployment of deep geothermal ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Bringing geothermal in from the margins \u2013 Anne Murrell, Lead of the Geothermal UK Coalition 8 Sep 2025 Bringing geothermal in from the margins \u2013 Anne Murrell, Lead of the Geothermal UK Coalition ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

As soon as the financing of the first project phase is completed, Vercana will begin installing the second electric drilling rig \u201cV10\u201d at the planned Trappelberg drilling site.\nThe construction of the V20 drilling rig follows the successful completion of key infrastructure work such as the construction of the Schleidberg drilling site, the establishment of the crew camp and the development of the access road. The electric drilling rig has an output of 2,500 hp, a hook load capacity of 550 tons and is equipped with a high-pressure pump system with up to 7,500 psi.\nDuring the construction work on the rig, there will be increased transport traffic around the drilling site. The transports are organized in close coordination with the responsible authorities to ensure smooth implementation and speedy execution and thus keep disruption to residents as low as possible.\nThe mining authority approved the special operating plan and transport permits for V20 in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, further permits were issued for special components of the drilling rig. After the rig has been constructed, routine commissioning and testing procedures will follow to ensure safe and efficient operation.\nVulcan is currently working on the implementation of the first project phase \u201cLionheart\u201d in the Landau region. The combined production of climate-neutral lithium and renewable energy will provide green district heating for households in the region. In addition, in phase one, Vulcan will produce around 24,000 tons of climate-neutral lithium hydroxide monohydrate annually for the automotive industry in Germany and Europe. This amount of lithium is sufficient to produce 500,000 electric vehicle batteries per year.\nManaging Director and CEO of Vulcan Energy, Cris Moreno, comments: \u201cThe construction of the V20 drilling rig is not only an important milestone for our Lionheart project, but also an important step on the way to establishing a sustainable and domestic supply chain for lithium. With two fully electric and modern drilling rigs and an experienced team, our in-house drilling company Vercana is excellently equipped to safely implement the deep geothermal drilling for the production of renewable energy and lithium here in the Upper Rhine Graben in the coming years. This will enable us to contribute to supplying the region with renewable base heat and support the transition to electromobility in Germany and Europe.\u201d\n\u201cWe are now entering a new phase of project development in which the safety and quality of the execution of our project is our top priority. In order to meet our high standards, we will work closely with all important partners and stakeholders in the region.\u201d\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Since being planted in July 2024, the fertilizer has yielded satisfactory results for the \u201cGustave\u201d variety of tomatoes in the Tonsewer village in Minahasa Regency, North Sulawesi. These results were announced during a joint harvest conducted on 31 October 2024 with partner farmers and researchers in attendance, as well as representatives from PGEO, the Minahasa Regency Government, and community leaders.\n\u201cKatrili\u201d has made tomato plants grow tall and resistant to pests. The fruits are abundant, large (diameter 5-8 cm), the flesh is thick and tastes sweet and fresh. Partner farmers from the Minahasa Protestant Church Farmers Group and the Minahasa Evangelical Christian Church Farmers Group stated that even tomatoes planted during the dry season can still grow perfectly.\nLaboratory test results have also proven that plants that receive the geothermal nanosilica liquid fertilizer and booster named Katrili are safe to consume because they do not contain heavy metals. Farmers send some of their abundant yields to Timika in Central Papua.

At present, the number of geothermal wells drilled globally is of the order of 600-800 per year. Predictions, however, suggest that this number will increase at least five-fold within the next couple of decades.\nThe vast majority of these wells will be drilled by IADC member companies.\nHosted in partnership with OMV, this inaugural IADC conference will focus on Geothermal Upstream, including a market outlook, subsurface, drilling, production, completions, regulatory environment, and associated topics. The participants will gain insights into relevant business and ownership models, contracting and procurement strategies, and supply chains.\nSeveral eminent industry leaders to give keynote and opening presentations at the conference, including:\n* Angelika Zartl-Klik,\n* Marit Brommer, \u2022\n* Bruce Gatherer,\nThe conference will showcase groundbreaking technologies with the potential to revolutionize the geothermal industry and the entire energy sector. IADC\u2019s expertise in providing definitions and guidelines for the Petroleum Upstream ideally positions it to establish a vocabulary, terms, and standards within the geothermal industry.\nGeothermal energy regulatory regimes are inconsistent, and immature compared to those of the oil and gas industry, which creates obstacles and extends the lead time for geothermal projects. The conference will analyze differences in regulatory regimes and provide valuable insights for businesses and regulators.\nLeading companies taking part include OMV, Boston Consulting Group, Eavor Technologies, ENI SpA, European Geothermal Energy Council, Geothermal Rising, Halliburton, H&P, Herrenknecht Vertical, Huisman, Iceland Drilling, International Energy Agency, International Geothermal Association, Nabors, NOV, Parker Wellbore, Rystad Energy, TNO, Weatherford, and more.\nThree panel sessions will be held throughout the two-day conference discussing \u201cA Rapid Growth in Geothermal Energy: What Will It Take to Happen?\u201d, \u201cTraditional Drilling & New Technologies,\u201d and \u201cPeople Versus Robots.\u201d\nThe conference further includes five technical sessions covering \u201cUrban Drilling,\u201d \u201cWell Design,\u201d \u201cHow Do We Address Supply Chain Capacity & Scale Issues?\u201d, \u201cWellbore Placement & Ranging,\u201d and \u201cWell Control.\u201d\nExamples of other important presentations to be made include \u201cGeothermal Market Outlook,\u201d \u201cIADC\u2019s Geothermal Well Drilling Guideline,\u201d and \u201cIEA Report: \u201cThe Future of Geothermal.\u201d\nJoin the IADC Geothermal Drilling Conference & Exhibition to discuss the exciting developments happening in the upstream aspects of geothermal energy production and the issues to be addressed. Be a part of the transformation that the geothermal industry has the potential to bring to the entire energy sector.\n#### About IADC\nThe\nmember companies collectively accounts for nearly 80% of all wells drilled globally. Its key focus areas include hosting industry conferences and enhancing workforce competence, with more than 125,000 students participating annually in IADC-accredited training programs.\n#### IADC\u2019s engagement in geothermal drilling\nOther trade organizations do an excellent job supporting the industry. However, when IADC\u2019s Geothermal Committee started its work in 2022, it soon became clear that there were areas where IADC\u2019s engagement would be welcomed. Not least has the association\u2019s experience and expertise in creating definitions and guidelines turned out to be particularly helpful in establishing a common language across the industry.\nIn that regard, intense work is going on in the IADC Geothermal Committee to write a Geothermal Well Drilling Guideline. The publication of the first part of this guideline is imminent.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

By implementing this strategy, Moldova could reduce its dependence on external energy sources, contribute to combating climate change, and stimulate sustainable economic development.\nThe document examines existing wells and their technical documentation from the archives of the Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources. It finds that shallow geothermal sources can be used for heating residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, as well as for cooling spaces during the warm season using the same infrastructure. Meanwhile, deep geothermal sources can be utilized for heat production for urban networks and industrial applications (processes that use steam, hot air, or hot water), agricultural applications (greenhouse heating, aquaculture, drying), and recreational applications (swimming pools, aquatic centers, steam baths).\n#### Pilot projects proposed\nThe document proposes a series of pilot projects that aim to utilize geothermal for heating in urban areas by 2027 to 2029. These projects include wells in the municipality of Chisinau (temperatures of up to 53\u00b0C at a depth of 1,140m), in Cahul (depths of 500-600m), and wells in the villages of Gura Cainarului and Marculesti, Floresti district.\nThe expansion of geothermal heating systems in municipalities and rural areas had also been proposed, as well as the building of small to medium-capacity geothermal power plants in regions with high geothermal potential. The estimated costs for developing the geothermal sector amount to approximately \u20ac300 million over 12 years, covering construction, installation, and\/or modernization of the necessary thermal heating infrastructure.\n#### Geothermal lacks a regulatory framework\nA significant part of the document outlines the existing regulatory framework in Moldova that can be considered applicable to geothermal. Geothermal has already been included in the country\u2019s legal framework for promoting the use of and establishing national objectives for energy from renewable sources. There are also laws on the protection of subsurface resources and for establishing management and protection rights for groundwater sources.\nHowever, the regulations in Moldova are far from enough to fully and effectively support geothermal development. The study proposes some regulations that can help achieve this goal:\n* Regulations on the definition and classification of geothermal resource\n* Regulations on licensing and concessions of geothermal sites\n* Environmental protection regulations, particularly during exploration and exploitation of geothermal resources\n* Regulations that promote energy efficiency and the use of cutting-edge technologies\n* Fiscal and financial incentives for geothermal investments\n* Regulations for cooperation between institutions and private-public partnerships\n* Regulations for training and professional education in the geothermal field\n* Regulations for monitoring and reporting of geothermal activities\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

This is especially true in Northern Ireland, where geothermal development has seen limited commercial success despite government and academic interest.\nA new study led by Joseph Fitzpatrick Ireland explores how a collective, multi-stakeholder vision-making process can catalyze market momentum and encourage institutional collaboration by cultivating a shared vision and mutual understanding among diverse stakeholders. This approach emphasizes that sustainable geothermal expansion requires a shared vision that considers local ecosystems and global sustainability goals.\nThe full paper, \u201cCollective vision-making practice: A long-run dynamic process model for geothermal market transitioning,\u201dRenewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews\nThe research introduces a dynamic process model that highlights the role of collective vision-making in fostering a shared understanding among multi-stakeholders. By aligning diverse interests, this model aims to unlock geothermal energy\u2019s potential, which remains underutilised in many regions. The findings highlight the importance of stakeholder engagement across institutional and technological boundaries to develop a sustainable market framework that advances geothermal projects.\nThis research holds particular relevance for policymakers, market actors, and industry leaders seeking to overcome the \u201cstuck\u201d nature of the geothermal market and accelerate its contribution to the global renewable energy mix.\n#### The \u2018stuck\u2019 nature of the geothermal market\nThe concept of being \u201cstuck\u201d comes from Michael Porter\u2019s theory on competitive strategy, applied here to an entire market. The geothermal market\u2019s slow growth is attributed to factors such as high costs, geological variability, and complex regulatory requirements.\nUnlike wind or solar, which have benefited from clear policy support, geothermal energy lacks consistent development frameworks across different regions. Northern Ireland\u2019s geothermal potential has been noted in several studies, yet local adoption remains limited, thus maintaining a high reliance on imported fossil fuels.\nThis study goes beyond viewing these issues as isolated barriers. It suggests they are symptoms of a broader institutional gap where stakeholders lack a shared vision. By developing a collective, dynamic model that aligns all the various actors, the research introduces a pathway to reshape the geothermal market\u2019s growth trajectory.\n#### The Collective Vision-Making Model\nThe heart of this study is a six-dimensional model for collective vision-making, which is designed to address the geothermal market\u2019s stagnation by promoting a collaborative, multi-stakeholder process. Each dimension involves specific practices that encourage stakeholders to co-create a future vision for geothermal energy.\n![]( vision-making practice model. (source: Ireland et al, 2024)\n1. Imagining\n2. Identifying\n3. Growing\n4. Multiplying\n5. Leading\n6. Grounding\nThese first-order visual dimensions are interconnected through twelve second-order behavioural practice: defining-developing, animating-storying, piloting-platforming, localising-globalising, transforming-serving, and traditionalising-modernising.\nEach dimension in this model represents a crucial step in transitioning from isolated actions to a unified geothermal market that benefits from a comprehensive institutional foundation.\n#### Ethnographic and longitudinal Insights\nThe research employs a longitudinal ethnographic methodology, allowing the researchers to capture the evolving dynamics within Northern Ireland\u2019s geothermal sector. The research spanned four years and included direct involvement in workshops, interviews with stakeholders, and ethnographic observations across public and private forums.\nUsing a \u201cLiving Codebook\u201d system, the researchers documented each stage of their analysis, from initial observations to refined insights. Notably, the ethnographic approach enabled a deep understanding of how community concerns and institutional barriers impact geothermal projects, with findings reflecting real-world complexities that go beyond theoretical models.\n#### Implications for thought leaders and policymakers\n* A greater emphasis on intangible relational spaces instead of focusing solely on technologies, policy, geology, and other material understandings of the energy sector. This means prioritizing the allocation of resources to support socio-cognitive institutional work including workshops and energy conferences, as well as the provision of spaces for discussion, consultation, disagreement, and dispute.\n* Thought leaders and policymakers must conscientiously practice collective vision-making beyond just being performative and use it as a tool for meaningful engagement. This requires shifting away from doing to be seen. This means maintaining socio-cognitive work over a sustained period, thus creating institutional stances that can be transitioned to policy missions.\n* Collective vision-making practice provides a relational orbiting tool around which the relationally \u2018stuck\u2019 can become unstuck. Leaders and policymakers should connect local and international influences to create broader change. Tools such as the \u201ctwo-table negotiation\u201d model allows for different viewpoints and interests to be considered, helping to ease strict stances and create a more cooperative market approach for geothermal energy.\n* Stakeholders in the geothermal industry should take advantage of network-building opportunities, particularly through online interaction. However, such type of engagement may miss out on some influential players such as government representatives. Leaders should adopt a collaborative platform mindset that invites more voices into discussions about geothermal energy, aiming to balance diverse perspectives thoughtfully. Key questions could include how to unlock new value by engaging various market perspectives and how to align all actors around a shared vision for long-term, sustainable market development.\n#### Broader applications and future work\nWhile focused on Northern Ireland\u2019s geothermal market, this model has potential applications across other renewable energy sectors facing similar challenges. The emphasis on collective vision-making and iterative development offers a blueprint for transitioning \u201cstuck\u201d markets toward sustainable growth. Future research could explore adapting this model to regions with different socio-political contexts or integrating it into global energy policy frameworks.\nThe study concludes by calling for interdisciplinary approaches that combine insights from institutional theory, market transition studies, and renewable energy policy.

The deal marks another significant step forward for geothermal energy in the U.S., reinforcing its role as a scalable, dispatchable clean energy source.\nThis is a milestone deal for geothermal in California. Under the agreement, Shell Energy will purchase 31 megawatts of firm geothermal power from Fervo\u2019s Cape Station project in Beaver County, Utah. The electricity will be delivered to California\u2019s grid, supporting Shell Energy\u2019s power delivery obligations to large energy customers and retail providers across the state.\nThe PPA supports California\u2019s clean energy goals by supplying round-the-clock, zero-emissions electricity that aligns with long-term reliability needs\u2014especially as the state phases out fossil fuels and scales intermittent renewables like solar and wind.\nPart of a growing trend in geothermal procurement\nThis deal adds to a growing list of corporate and utility geothermal PPAs signed in recent years. Fervo previously secured a 115 MW geothermal PPA with Google, with power also sourced from its Cape Station development.\n\u201cShell Energy is proud to collaborate with Fervo to bring more 24\/7 clean electricity to the grid,\u201d said Glenn Wright, President of Shell Energy North America. \u201cThis agreement supports our goal of helping customers decarbonize with firm renewable power.\u201d\nAdvanced technology unlocking new potential\nFervo\u2019s Cape Station project uses enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) and advanced drilling techniques adapted from the oil and gas industry. This approach enables geothermal development in areas previously inaccessible, dramatically expanding potential resources.\nAccording to Fervo, the Cape Station site is expected to come online in 2026 and, once completed, will be the largest next-generation geothermal project in the U.S.\nThis latest PPA with Shell Energy further cements geothermal\u2019s growing value as a firm, clean energy solution that complements intermittent sources. As more corporations and utilities seek 24\/7 carbon-free electricity, geothermal is becoming a cornerstone in clean energy portfolios.\nWith this agreement, Fervo continues to demonstrate how innovative geothermal development can support grid reliability, emissions reduction, and scalable decarbonization\u2014key priorities in both California and global energy markets.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![SLB and Ormat partner to fast-track development of integrated geothermal assets 27 Oct 2025 SLB and Ormat partner to fast-track development of integrated geothermal assets ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development 27 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![BLM Nevada geothermal lease sale nets over USD 9 million in bids on 86 parcels 23 Oct 2025 BLM Nevada geothermal lease sale nets over USD 9 million in bids on 86 parcels ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program 22 Oct 2025 Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards 17 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program 15 Oct 2025 California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University 2 Oct 2025 PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Turboden to deliver ORC systems for Phase II of Cape Station geothermal project in Utah 2 Oct 2025 Turboden to deliver ORC systems for Phase II of Cape Station geothermal project in Utah ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![XGS Energy completes 3000-hour operations of geothermal technology in Coso, California 30 Sep 2025 XGS Energy completes 3000-hour operations of geothermal technology in Coso, California ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells 25 Sep 2025 Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Quaise holds public demonstration of millimeter wave technology for geothermal drilling 22 Sep 2025 Quaise holds public demonstration of millimeter wave technology for geothermal drilling ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

How far the announced legislation approved by California\u2019s governor in January 2025 solves this and addresses below notes is a bit unclear. Under that law approval processes for geothermal exploratory drilling projects would not have to go through the understaffed California Geologic Energy Management Division (CalGEM), but county planning departments would now be able take the lead in conducting environmental reviews of proposed exploratory drilling projects for geothermal.\nSlow permitting vs. growing demand\nDespite a state mandate for 2 GW of new geothermal capacity, developers face a two-year permitting process for exploratory drilling \u2013 compared to just 10 days on federal land outside California. This creates additional cost and risk, potentially driving investments to other western states.\nKey challenges & legislative fixes:\n* AB 526 \u2013 Calls for a strategic plan for geothermal energy in California.\n* AB 527 \u2013 Aligns California\u2019s permitting process with federal standards to streamline approvals.\n* AB 531 \u2013 Expands California Energy Commission oversight to projects of all sizes, not just those above 50 MW.\n\u201cSince 1989, nearly all new geothermal development has occurred outside California,\u201d said Geof Syphers, CEO of Sonoma Clean Power, emphasizing the urgency of these legislative changes.\nGeoZone & industry partnerships\nSonoma Clean Power\u2019s GeoZone initiative, which we previously reported on at ThinkGeoEnergy, is working to remove barriers for developers. Chevron New Energies recently acquired land within the GeoZone, but permitting bottlenecks have delayed exploratory drilling. Other companies exploring the region include Eavor Technologies and Ormat Technologies.\nAdditionally, Sonoma, Lake, and Mendocino counties have applied for a $1.3 million California Energy Commission grant to proactively identify low-impact geothermal development sites, aiming to accelerate environmental reviews.\nWhat\u2019s next for California geothermal?\nWithout reform, California risks losing out on geothermal investment, increasing reliance on imported clean energy\u2014such as Fervo Energy\u2019s 400 MW project in Utah, which will supply power to Southern California Edison but require costly transmission upgrades.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area 27 Oct 2025 Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program 15 Oct 2025 California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Arup 13 Oct 2025 Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Aru ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brazil approves creation of a National Geothermal Energy Program 1 Oct 2025 Brazil approves creation of a National Geothermal Energy Program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Growing geothermal momentum in focus at the 3rd Budapest Geothermal Energy Summit 30 Sep 2025 Growing geothermal momentum in focus at the 3rd Budapest Geothermal Energy Summit ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells 25 Sep 2025 Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GEOENERG\u00cdA presents proposals for draft Royal Decree on heating and cooling networks in Spain 19 Sep 2025 GEOENERG\u00cdA presents proposals for draft Royal Decree on heating and cooling networks in Spain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![India publishes National Policy setting a framework for geothermal development 17 Sep 2025 India publishes National Policy setting a framework for geothermal development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![El Salvador legislation approves Geothermal Energy Law 11 Sep 2025 El Salvador legislation approves Geothermal Energy Law ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Bringing geothermal in from the margins \u2013 Anne Murrell, Lead of the Geothermal UK Coalition 8 Sep 2025 Bringing geothermal in from the margins \u2013 Anne Murrell, Lead of the Geothermal UK Coalition ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Almost all systems achieved very high annual availability, which shows the reliability of the technology.\nIn terms of efficiency, no other heat generation can keep up with geothermal energy. The Bavarian geothermal systems achieved COP values ??of up to 36 \u2013 this means that 36 kWh heat are generated from 1 kWh of electrical energy. These are impressive values ??compared to heat pumps, where the conversion of 1 kWh of electricity into 3 to 5 kWh of heat is already considered efficient.\nDuring the same event, KfW and Munich Re announced a joint development risk mitigation program that aims to support further geothermal growth in Germany.\n#### Award-winning geothermal plants\nSeveral geothermal heating and power plants in Bavaria were once again recognized during the event to highlight their excellence in efficiency and performance. The awards ceremony was led by Wolfgang Geisinger from Geothermie Unterhaching.\n\u201cGolden Heating Plant\u201d\u201cThe plant has shown the highest availability of all heating plants, it ran virtually around the clock throughout 2023,\u201cI accept the award on behalf of my colleagues. The project shows that geothermal energy can be scaled. We are making a significant contribution to reducing CO2 in Munich.\u201d\nThe \u201cGolden Power Plant\u201d\u201cThe operators have really worked their way up with this power plant. They use their resources optimally, and they absolutely deserve this award,\u201d\u201cThis is a great recognition, both for our power plant and for our team. Thank you.\u201d\nDue to special achievements, the organizers have decided to introduce two new prizes this year: The \u201cGolden Borehole\u201d \u201cThat is the heat of a small town; the people of Traunreut heat their town with a borehole 20 cm in diameter,\u201d \u201cOf course, this is always a team effort. We do a lot of good here and are happy to share it with the outside world.\u201d\nThe Waldkraiburg geothermal energy plant was awarded the \u201cEfficiency Master\u201d\u201cThe efficiency of geothermal energy is 10 times higher than that of a heat pump and 100 times higher than that of hydrogen. With geothermal energy, we have a big key in our hands and we now have to turn it. The Waldkraiburg geothermal energy plant produced a sensational 36 MWh of heat per MWh of electricity used,\u201cCongratulations for that.\u201d\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards 17 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Applications open for 2025 Christian Hecht award for geothermal research 6 May 2025 Applications open for 2025 Christian Hecht award for geothermal research ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![EnBW wins European Geothermal Innovation Award for lithium extraction technology 21 Feb 2025 EnBW wins European Geothermal Innovation Award for lithium extraction technology ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![EGEC announces nominations for 2025 Ruggero Bertani geothermal innovation award 29 Jan 2025 EGEC announces nominations for 2025 Ruggero Bertani geothermal innovation award ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Nominations open for 2025 Ruggero Bertani geothermal innovation award 27 Nov 2024 Nominations open for 2025 Ruggero Bertani geothermal innovation award ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal plants in Bavaria, Germany recognized for performance, efficiency 28 Oct 2024 Geothermal plants in Bavaria, Germany recognized for performance, efficiency ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s Prof. Dr. Alper Baba named among Top 100 Most Influential Scientists 9 Oct 2024 T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s Prof. Dr. Alper Baba named among Top 100 Most Influential Scientists ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Nominations open for 2024 GRC Honors and Awards 9 Jul 2024 Nominations open for 2024 GRC Honors and Awards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![OU team pitches geothermal greenhouse design for Osage Nation in Oklahoma 11 Jun 2024 OU team pitches geothermal greenhouse design for Osage Nation in Oklahoma ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![ISOR, Blue Spark Energy win Innovation Awards at Iceland Geothermal Conference 6 Jun 2024 ISOR, Blue Spark Energy win Innovation Awards at Iceland Geothermal Conference ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Nominations open for 2024 WING Core Value Awards 4 Jun 2024 Nominations open for 2024 WING Core Value Awards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

(source: IKPT)\n![ ](\n![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 25 Feb 2025\nPT Supreme Energy Muara Laboh has awarded the EPC contract for the Muara Laboh Unit 2 geothermal power plant to a consortium of local and foreign partners.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nThe EPC contract was officially signed on 24 December 2024, while a handover contract ceremony was held at the head office of SEML on 13 February 2025.\nMuara Laboh Unit 2 has a planned installed capacity of 80 MW and is scheduled to be operational by early 2027. Just recently, SEML secured financing of USD 92.6 million from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the project. Shortly before that, SEML also announced an amendment of their PPA with power distributor PT PLN for the 80-MW Muara Laboh Unit 2 and the 60-MW Muara Laboh Unit 3.\nSEML is a joint venture between PT Supreme Energy, Sumitomo Corporation, and INPEX Corporation.\n#### Engaging with local communities\nA few days after the handover ceremony, representatives of PT Supreme Energy and the EPC consortium held a public consultation event with the communities associated with the Muara Laboh Unit 2 project.\nYasin Yunirwansyah of IKPT explained that the workforce for the projects will be composed of more than 50% of local works. \u201cThe need for workers during the 30-month project will peak at around 1,500 workers at the end of 2026. The number of workers will continue to decrease towards the completion of the construction of this power plant,\n\u201cThe implementation of recruitment and placement of workers will be carried out in accordance with statutory provisions and other requirements,\u201d said Yasin. According to him, IKPT will target ready-for-hire workers in the South Solok Regency. The placement of workers will be based on their skills, particularly in certain competencies.\nIsmoyo Argo, Senior Manager of Business Relations & General Affairs of Supreme Energy, further emphasized that the project will prioritize the people of South Solok and West Sumatra. This has also been the case for Muara Laboh Unit 1, where almost 90% of the workforce are local residents. This number has continued to grow in the last three years.\n\u201cWithout collaboration and synergy from all stakeholders, we cannot build and operate this PLTP. Hopefully this project will run smoothly and the production target can be on schedule in 2027,\u201d\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya 28 Oct 2025 Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area 27 Oct 2025 Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines 22 Oct 2025 EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia 20 Oct 2025 Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia 17 Oct 2025 Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation 16 Oct 2025 China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated 16 Oct 2025 Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia 8 Oct 2025 Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia 3 Oct 2025 Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Seismic surveys to determine the most suitable locations for drilling are currently ongoing. Drilling is expected to start by 2026 with the target to start heat delivery by 2028.\n#### Transitioning from oil and gas to geothermal\nThe agreement is a part of Denmark\u2019s largest civil construction project within district heating, where 39,000 new heating customers change from oil and gas sourced heating to district heating. At the same time, the agreement brings geothermal energy to the Greater Copenhagen area for the first time, where the potential to use geothermal energy for district heating is particularly good.\nVestforbr\u00e6nding is well under way with an extensive plan for 39,000 district heating customers in Ballerup, Herlev, Gladsaxe, Lyngby-Taarb\u00e6k, Fures\u00f8, Frederikssund and Egedal \u2013 all municipalities in Greater Copenhagen \u2013 to change from oil and gas sourced heating to district heating. The plan will nearly double Vestforbr\u00e6nding\u2019s heating supply and will make the network one of the largest in Denmark.\nGeothermal energy is one of the new heat sources that Vestforbr\u00e6nding is incorporating into the future of district heating, and it will increase heating supply security. Other new heat sources are e.g. waste heat from companies and carbon capture.\n\u201cWe will need much more district heating in the future, and for district heating to come from several different sources. This will provide a robust supply and will secure stable and low prices for end users,\u201d\n\u201cGeothermal energy fits in perfectly. When customers change from their individual heat source to district heating, they will also avoid the price dependency on a single energy source, regardless of whether it is oil, gas or electricity.\u201d\n#### Unlocking future projects\nFor Innargi, the agreement means the start of geothermal energy production from the geological reservoir that lies beneath most of Greater Copenhagen.\n\u201cThe geological conditions to establish geothermal energy in the Greater Copenhagen area for district heating are really good. So the project is hopefully just the first of several with Vestforbr\u00e6nding, which will roll out much more district heating. At the same time, we make the possibilities for the other district heating companies in Greater Copenhagen tangible, which are also expanding their network and considering alternatives to biomass,\u201d\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

It lacks visible hot springs or geysers, and its remote location is not obviously conducive to supporting a large-scale logistical operation. However, geothermal startup\nFervo\u2019s private Cape Station enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) project sits just a stone\u2019s throw away from the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s\nIt is in this remote valley that Fervo plans to design, construct, and operate the world\u2019s largest enhanced geothermal power facility to demonstrate that geothermal energy is a scalable and cost-effective solution ready for widespread deployment today.\n#### Remote location, hard rock, and heat pose challenges\nEven with the benchmark data from FORGE and experience with horizontal well drilling from Project Red, Cape Station presented a series of new challenges that required an innovative approach to logistics, project management, technology, and well optimization. Fervo set a high bar for success from the start; by the end of phase one alone, they will have drilled more than 20 wells.\nFrom a technical standpoint, Fervo\u2019s primary challenge consisted of drilling EGS in a remote area. Equipment must not only penetrate a difficult granite formation but also withstand temperatures on the upper end of the spectrum conventional drilling equipment can handle. Hard rock and abrasiveness characterize the granite formation, and bottomhole temperatures could reach up to 450\u00b0F (232\u00b0C).\n![]( rig at Fervo Energy\u2019s Cape Station site (source: Fervo Energy)\n#### Deliberate, focused efforts break records\nPrior to FORGE and Cape Station, the large-scale commercial deployment of EGS had been a pipe dream. But not only did Fervo successfully drill wells, it hit its 30-day well time milestone \u2013 one that they didn\u2019t expect to achieve until deep into field drilling \u2013 on its third well. Now, with more than 15 wells drilled, Fervo has dropped its well time to sub-20 days. Compared to Project Red, Fervo achieved a 70 percent reduction in drilling time.\nFervo\u2019s Project Red in Nevada provided important lessons that have applied to Cape Station. The drilling team was able to capitalize on learnings from Project Red by optimizing the well design to ensure that all well construction objectives could be satisfied whilst realizing greater operational and cost efficiencies. As Fervo continues to de-risk operations, it will further optimize well designs to capitalize on learnings picked up along the way.\nThe prioritization of a deliberate, focused effort geared towards on-bottom drilling optimization and a scientific approach to changes also helped Fervo achieve its goals. The operator drew from approaches pioneered by Fred Dupriest, a former chief drilling engineer for ExxonMobil who provided instruction for the drilling team at FORGE [[1]]( Dupriest\u2019s approach emphasizes the use of physics to identify and reduce performance limiters. Fervo applies Dupriest\u2019s approach not only for drilling optimization, but also to the overall well construction process to understand where optimization opportunities exist. Through this method, Fervo identifies potential limitations and engineers those limiters out of the way.\nFervo also applied a structured, deliberate continuous-improvement approach to how it makes changes in its EGS wells. The operator acts deliberately and intentionally as it tests and evaluates operational variables to achieve desired outcomes. The desire to be intentional and more predictable drives Fervo\u2019s approach to how it makes well construction decisions, what tools they select, and what equipment they choose, such as liner hangers and cement slurries.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mindset,\u201d \u201cIf you take this deliberate, calculated approach, you\u2019re getting it right the first time, and you\u2019re achieving ROI faster.\u201d\nOil and gas service companies provide critical technologies, services\nTraditional oil and gas operators shy away from ultra-high strength rock, but for Fervo, the ability to target these formations would prove crucial. As the leading new operator in the geothermal energy space, Fervo has leveraged relationships with service companies to help improve upon its well design and approach.\nFervo and\nHalliburton also engineered a non-Portland cement blend to help ensure long-term well integrity. Fervo began with a very conservative cement design but realized they needed a new approach because of the high temperature of EGS projects. Conservative cementing formulas can be expensive. Fervo reduced costs by collaborating with Halliburton to optimize the slurry design for bottomhole circulation temperatures.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of progress on cementing, both in terms of achieving our primary cement objectives and demonstrating that the wells, post-cementing, have the integrity that we need to complete them the way we intend,\u201d\u201cWorking with Halliburton has provided a very quick turnaround time in terms of redesigning slurries and changing our plans as we learn more about the wells. There is not a lot of lag time between seeing an opportunity to improve and then actually closing the gap to yield the improvement.\u201d\nAfter the success of the liner hangers and cement, Fervo and Halliburton began to collaborate on other parts of the Cape Station wells to include Halliburton\u2019s Baroid drilling fluids.\n\u201cWe\u2019re using a scientific approach to optimize well construction. Halliburton\u2019s expertise in the chemistry of cement and drilling fluids and the physics of mechanical liner hangers has been a value additive to Fervo\u2019s goals,\u201d\u201cHalliburton\u2019s commitment to service quality is also a great fit for Fervo\u2019s goals.\u201d\n![]( Cape Station geothermal project in Utah (source: Fervo Energy)\n#### Optimize logistics to improve efficiency and reduce costs\nThe remote location of Cape Station did pose logistical challenges for Fervo. Regardless of the supplier, cement slurries, liner hangers, and other products had to be shipped from distant locations to Beaver County. Cement jobs required careful planning due to their quick turnaround times.\nThe Halliburton team helped optimize logistics to minimize the number of trips from Bakersfield, CA where it mixed cement slurries. In cases where Fervo batch-drilled wells, it could load out cement for multiple wells instead of sending trucks for each job. This allowed Fervo to lower emissions, safety exposure, and even rig time, as it could keep the required supplies on location to immediately begin the next phase of the project.\n#### Continuous refinement at Cape Station\nFervo\u2019s methodical approach to drilling geothermal wells includes planning for contingencies and learning from challenges. They have proven the value of upfront modeling to address edge cases and plan for uncertainty, which helps ensure success during execution.\nFervo also evaluates previous project performance to identify opportunities for optimization. The decision to use Halliburton\u2019s Bariod drilling fluids, for example, stems from a desire to further optimize drilling fluid design to effectively mitigate challenges observed in the granite interval. The ability to understand challenges, identify root causes, and address them in a way that is both sustainable and cost-effective, while ensuring long-term efficiency, requires continuous effort.\nHalliburton engineered custom fluid solutions to maximize wellbore value for Fervo. The company introduced technology and services that helped Fervo reduce surface consumption by more than 80 percent and decrease defoamer usage in the production section by more than 50 percent.\nHalliburton will soon collect samples from highly reactive clay zones when they are drilled for analysis and proper inhibition mechanisms. This process will allow Fervo to predict and prevent risks before they occur based on analytical and operational insights. For program continuous improvement, new lubricants are in development to mitigate future foaming risks.\n\u201cWe\u2019re building on that critical first well process and global expertise and support from Halliburton that we\u2019ve seen with liner hangers and cementing, hoping to see to the same on the drilling fluids front to help us optimize,\u201d\nThe future at Cape Station involves continuous innovation on well designs to enhance productivity and reduce well time and costs. Unlike oil and gas wells, where operators drill for oil and gas and deplete the reservoir, EGS systems do not access a commodity and shut down. The potential to improve productivity lies in drilling into deeper and hotter formations and the creation of larger bore sizes. Meanwhile, Fervo will also look for ways to optimize drilling, improve performance, and reduce cycle time.\nFervo\u2019s success at Cape Station shows there are no remaining technical barriers to large scale EGS deployment.\nBy 2026, Fervo expects to start grid supply from its Cape Station project. It already signed two PPAs totaling 320 MW with Southern California Edison, and Cape Station may prove itself as the most productive EGS in history. [[2]](\n\u201cCape Station is where EGS starts and it\u2019s also going to be where EGS evolves and improves. We think that the area will be as consequential for geothermal as the Permian Basin is for oil and gas,\u201d\n[[1]](\n[[2]]( Fervo announces technical and commercial breakthroughs at Cape Station geothermal site (thinkgeoenergy.com)\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards 23 Oct 2025 Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Arup 13 Oct 2025 Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Aru ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress 10 Oct 2025 Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya 6 Oct 2025 Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa 2 Oct 2025 The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels 24 Sep 2025 Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France 18 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! 17 Sep 2025 One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest 15 Sep 2025 Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees 12 Sep 2025 Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Space constraints, budget limitations, or both often add to the difficulty. By integrating a ground-source heat pump (GSHP) with other technologies\u2014creating a hybrid heating and cooling system\u2014we can develop a more resilient and cost-effective solution for the ever-growing complexity of modern buildings.\nHowever, designing these systems is far from straightforward. In this webinar, we will explore the concept of geothermal potential, discuss methods for optimizing both power and energy, and demonstrate how a tool like GHEtool can help you design smarter, more efficient hybrid geothermal systems in practice.\nWouter Peere graduated in 2020 as a mechanical engineer at the Catholic University of Leuven (Belgium) with a thesis on the topic of hybrid geothermal design. After a research period of 3 years at this university, in close collaboration with Sweco, he started his own engineering firm Enead.

The aim of the partnership is to develop advanced solutions that can enable greater use of geothermal energy, both in Italy and internationally. In particular, Saipem\u2019s three main areas of interest are next-generation geothermal systems, offshore geothermal energy, and the reconversion of oil & gas wells.\nThe Memorandum of Understanding provides that the three companies will conduct joint studies on unconventional geothermal energy, i.e. terrestrial heat sources that are difficult to access and therefore still poorly exploited, and on offshore energy, which for example is abundant in the Mediterranean basin.\nSaipem had previously entered a similar cooperation agreement with National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Italy.\nSaipem will study the feasibility of geothermal plants, evaluating the technical solutions currently available on the market and identifying any technological gaps. Geolog and Ignis will contribute their expertise to evaluate geological formations and drilling solutions, as well as to analyze for the availability of geothermal resources. Ignis Energy is very active in several geothermal exploration projects in T\u00fcrkiye and Alaska.\nGeothermal energy is a strategic resource in the energy transition process as it is a reliable and continuous source of renewable energy, but still little used compared to its real potential. Saipem, thanks to its specialist skills and innovation capacity, aspires to propose reliable and innovative solutions to support the development of this sector. The company offers its vast experience in the development of conventional geothermal projects and geothermal wells carried out in Italy and internationally since the 70s, as well as in the offshore, drilling and floating plant construction sectors.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Zarrouk, co-director of the\nWorking in collaboration with water well drilling company\n\u201cThe long-term vision is to make the technology low-cost and simple to implement in both new builds and existing buildings. The goal is to see it adopted widely as a clean, cost-effective energy solution,\u201d\nThe technology works by drilling a shallow well near the property and running a water pipe through it. As the water flows through the pipe, it absorbs natural heat from the ground. This raises the water temperature by a few degrees, meaning less electricity is needed to heat it to the desired level \u2013 ultimately reducing overall energy use and power bills.\nA special phase-change material that is used to efficiently store and distribute thermal energy will help to balance energy demand during peak usage times, according to Zarrouk.\nThe research team installed 15 sensors in the well to monitor temperature changes down to 20 metres below ground level. The data is being analysed using machine learning tools to help optimise the design of a second well, which is due to be drilled in the coming months.\nBoth wells will be monitored over the next year to better understand seasonal temperature behaviour. If results are promising, heat extraction systems will be installed to test the technology further.\n\u201cAs the first study of its kind in Aotearoa New Zealand, this research has the potential to change the country\u2019s energy use, paving the way for more sustainable and affordable heating options. If successful, the findings could provide long-term scientific and practical benefits, reducing reliance on traditional power sources,\u201d\n**RELATED: New Zealand tissue and toilet paper company shifts to 100% geothermal**\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya 28 Oct 2025 Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area 27 Oct 2025 Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines 22 Oct 2025 EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia 20 Oct 2025 Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia 17 Oct 2025 Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation 16 Oct 2025 China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated 16 Oct 2025 Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia 8 Oct 2025 Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia 3 Oct 2025 Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

That is why every alternative form of energy generation is one to be taken seriously,\u201d\n\u201cIt really feels like looking for gold to me, because how great would it be if we could help to realize a production location with this exploratory drilling, in De Bilt or nearby?\u201d\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

These pioneering projects exemplify the innovation, ingenuity, and commitment needed to drive geothermal energy forward as a cornerstone of sustainable energy systems in Europe and beyond. Each finalist has contributed groundbreaking solutions that highlight the potential of geothermal technology to address pressing global energy challenges,\u201d\n![]( 2024 in Offenburg, Germany (source: GeoTHERM)\nThe finalists and their entries are the following:\n#### Energie Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (EnBW) \u2013 CASCADE\nCASCADE is a new process scheme that addresses the high amount of energy and water needed by current Al-based processes for lithium extraction from geothermal brine. By using a second reactor with a Ti-\/Mn-based adsorbents, the process of water can be recycled, and the energy and transportation effort is significantly reduced. Meanwhile, the purity of the second pre-product is sufficiently high to produce solid lithium salt on-site using established processes. CASCADE is a patented technology (patent number 102023118 084.3).\n#### Halliburton \u2013 Truesync PMM: Geothermal Electric Submersible Pump (GeoESP) Motor\nThe TrueSync 738 series hybrid PMM revolutionises electric submersible pump (ESP) technology for geothermal applications, offering a blend of high performance and robust durability. TrueSync\u2019s originality lies in its hybrid design, which ingeniously combines elements from traditional induction motor technology to overcome the limitations faced by standard permanent magnet motors. This innovation extends the operational life of ESP systems and stabilizes their performance in extreme conditions.\n#### Iceland GeoSurvey (ISOR) \u2013 Flexible Coupling\nThe novel patented technology of Flexible Couplings has been in development within \u00cdSOR \u2013 Iceland GeoSurvey. Flexible Couplings are designed to mitigate casing failures in production casings of high-temperature geothermal wells, that are caused by constrained thermal expansion. By implementing Flexible Couplings in the production casing, each casing joint (around 12 m) is allowed to expand. Thermal straining of the casing is prevented, and the risk of casing failures is minimized, thereby increasing the reliability of wells. A batch of Flexible Couplings was delivered to ON Power, a subsidiary of Reykjavik Energy, in the fall of 2024 to be used in their next well drilled in Nesjavellir, Iceland, in January-March 2025.\n#### Mines Paris (PSL Univeristy) \u2013 ORCHYD\nORCHYD was an H2020 project funded by the European Commission with the goal of building a prototype drilling tool that showcases an improvement of at least 4X in penetration rate compared to conventional rotary techniques while drilling deep geothermal wells. It was mainly aimed at drilling hard crystalline rocks like granites, usually found in depths beyond 4km.\nThe originality of the project comes from creating a fully fluid driven down the hole (DTH) system combining two mature rock breaking technologies \u2013 percussion drilling and high-pressure water jetting (HPWJ).\n#### QHeat \u2013 Integration of Heating and Storage Wells to Waste Burning Facility\nThis project focuses on the use of Coaxial Reversible Medium-Deep Geothermal Heat Wells (MDGHWs) for a waste-to-energy facility in Finland. This innovative geothermal solution provides both heating and cooling for the facility while storing excess thermal energy for later use. While the primary focus is on waste-to-energy, the technology\u2019s potential for cooling applications in data centres remains a concept for the future.\nThis project is original because it combines two innovative approaches: the use of Coaxial Reversible Medium-Deep Geothermal Heat Wells (MDGHWs) for geothermal heat extraction and storage, alongside the integration of waste heat from a biomass plant. The MDGHWs are designed to operate at deeper geothermal depths (1,000-2,000 meters), enhancing thermal extraction efficiency compared to traditional geothermal systems.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards 17 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Applications open for 2025 Christian Hecht award for geothermal research 6 May 2025 Applications open for 2025 Christian Hecht award for geothermal research ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![EnBW wins European Geothermal Innovation Award for lithium extraction technology 21 Feb 2025 EnBW wins European Geothermal Innovation Award for lithium extraction technology ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![EGEC announces nominations for 2025 Ruggero Bertani geothermal innovation award 29 Jan 2025 EGEC announces nominations for 2025 Ruggero Bertani geothermal innovation award ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Nominations open for 2025 Ruggero Bertani geothermal innovation award 27 Nov 2024 Nominations open for 2025 Ruggero Bertani geothermal innovation award ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal plants in Bavaria, Germany recognized for performance, efficiency 28 Oct 2024 Geothermal plants in Bavaria, Germany recognized for performance, efficiency ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s Prof. Dr. Alper Baba named among Top 100 Most Influential Scientists 9 Oct 2024 T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s Prof. Dr. Alper Baba named among Top 100 Most Influential Scientists ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Nominations open for 2024 GRC Honors and Awards 9 Jul 2024 Nominations open for 2024 GRC Honors and Awards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![OU team pitches geothermal greenhouse design for Osage Nation in Oklahoma 11 Jun 2024 OU team pitches geothermal greenhouse design for Osage Nation in Oklahoma ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![ISOR, Blue Spark Energy win Innovation Awards at Iceland Geothermal Conference 6 Jun 2024 ISOR, Blue Spark Energy win Innovation Awards at Iceland Geothermal Conference ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Nominations open for 2024 WING Core Value Awards 4 Jun 2024 Nominations open for 2024 WING Core Value Awards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Technology\n# Project InnerSpace highlights India\u2019s geothermal potential with GeoMap\n!Project InnerSpace highlights India\u2019s geothermal potential with GeoMap GeoMap showing industrial heat demand in India (source: screenshot, GeoMap)\n![ ](\n![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 12 Nov 2024\nThe GeoMap geothermal exploration tool by Project InnerSpace has been expanded yet again to highlight areas with geothermal development potential in India.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nThe latest addition expands upon the scope of GeoMap, which initially included Nigeria as a first case study and was then updated to encompass North America.\nGeoMap\u2122 India includes more than 175 subsurface and surface layers, including a prospecting tool to identify the most promising regions for development of geothermal powered data centers. GeoMap\u2122 India also identifies coal power plants with the potential for conversion to geothermal power, and industrial zones that could benefit from geothermal heat networks.\nGeoMap\u2122 India highlights several regions in India that are particularly promising for geothermal development requiring higher temperatures, like for power and industrial heat production. These regions include:\n* Gujarat State on India\u2019s west coast, including the area of the Southern Cambay Basin and the major industrial zone of Jhagadia;\n* Large areas of east and northeast India, particularly in the Bihar and Meghalaya States, and into the southern eastern portion of Assam;\n* The Himalayan region of northwestern India;\n* Through the central Son Narmada Fault Zone, one of India\u2019s most significant tectonic areas, and the location of the Tatapani Geothermal Field;\n* Along the eastern coast in the Andhra Pradesh State, along the Godavari rift, including the outskirts of Vijayawada, Andhra\u2019s commercial hub.\nTo illustrate the real world impact of geothermal development in one of these promising areas, Project InnerSpace partnered with Aarti Industries, a chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturer with facilities in Jhagadia, Gujarat, on a feasibility study to examine how a geothermal conversion pilot might provide power and industrial heat to one of its facilities.\n\u201cIndustrial heat is challenging to decarbonize using intermittent renewable electricity. Hence, the chemical industry, which uses a lot of industrial heat, is a hard-to-abate sector,\u201d\u201cGeothermal is an excellent source of clean baseload power and heat, with the potential to enable our plants to operate without disruption while also minimizing our carbon footprint. We are thrilled that GeoMap India identified the industrial zone in Jhagadia as a place where geothermal development is possible, and we look forward to exploring ways to integrate this enormous resource into our operations.\u201d\nAside from the regions identified as top candidates for high temperature industrial heat and power development, importantly also, the entirety of India is ripe for residential and small-scale commercial geothermal heating and cooling development. This near term prospect for massively scalable and energy efficient cooling solutions could prove to be one of the most impactful geothermal opportunities to emerge in a rapidly warming world.\n\u201cThe elephant in the room in a warming and changing climate is our current inability to keep people cool during heat waves, which are growing in intensity and becoming increasingly unsurvivable in some regions of the world,\u201d\n\u201cIndia is soon to become the world\u2019s most populous nation, is at increased risk of deadly heat events, and faces soaring energy demand in the coming decades. The convergence of these factors makes rapid development of geothermal for cooling in particular, a very high impact opportunity,\u201d\nOver the coming months, Project InnerSpace, along with its partners, will work to unlock the geothermal potential illustrated by GeoMap\u2122 India. In partnership with the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), a leading think tank in Delhi, and in collaboration with academics from IIT-Guwahati, Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU), and Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy, Project InnerSpace will publish the \u2018Future of Geothermal In India,\u2019 a deep dive analysis of opportunities, incentives, and supportive policies that would aid the growth and development of geothermal in India.\n\u201cAs India builds a resilient energy ecosystem, geothermal technologies, which can offer firm and flexible power, are worth exploring to provide much needed diversity to the energy mix. Newer ways of tapping into geothermal can make it an important source of clean firm energy in India and help reduce the challenges of intermittency that solar and wind pose. We are actively collaborating with scientific agencies to understand the potential resources in India, and inform policy making that will help realize this potential\u201d\nProject InnerSpace will host a free webinar on Nov. 19 to explore the features of the GeoMap\u2122 India tool. The webinar is open to all.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya 28 Oct 2025 Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area 27 Oct 2025 Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines 22 Oct 2025 EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia 20 Oct 2025 Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia 17 Oct 2025 Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation 16 Oct 2025 China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated 16 Oct 2025 Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia 8 Oct 2025 Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia 3 Oct 2025 Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Unlike traditional drill rigs that require drill rods to be connected and disconnected multiple times during the drilling, CoilRig uses a continuous \u2018coiled tubing\u2019 drill pipe, which is wound onto a reel and unrolls as it drills into the ground, increasing installation efficiency and safety.\nThe design also reduces bending and stretching of the tubing, thus helping it last three times longer and resulting in more cost savings for rig operators.\nResearch into developing the new technology has been undertaken by Coilrig in partnership with researchers from the University of South Australia, Minex CRC, and other industry partners.\n#### Prototype testing in 2025\nThe funding will go towards further product development and commercialization of the technology, including lab testing, purchasing specialised software and materials, and on-site trials and testing with their US-based customer. CoilRig is currently manufacturing its first prototype in Adelaide, which will be exported to New York State in 2025 after simulated field testing and trials.\nAccording to Director and Co-Founder of CoilRig, Soren Soe, the biggest barrier to adopting geothermal energy in buildings is the cost of drilling. \u201cThe cost of drilling can make up to 50% of the total installation costs. This is where CoilRig can provide customers with a distinct and competitive advantage, as our drilling rigs offer increased efficiency and effectiveness due to the innovative components designed by our team.\u201d\nShane Fox, Engineering Manager at CoilRig, emphasizes that the technology is unique to the Australian industry. \u201cWe have developed coiled tubing drilling equipment for the minerals industry, but this has never been done in Australia for the geothermal industry. Once we have demonstrated these results \u2013 and validated them in a simulated field trial \u2013we can utilise this data to develop future rigs.\u201d\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya 28 Oct 2025 Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area 27 Oct 2025 Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines 22 Oct 2025 EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia 20 Oct 2025 Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia 17 Oct 2025 Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation 16 Oct 2025 China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated 16 Oct 2025 Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia 8 Oct 2025 Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia 3 Oct 2025 Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

We cannot rely indefinitely on external expertise,\u201d\n#### Building geothermal expertise in the Caribbean region\nFRENZ is delivered by Cowater International, in association with JRG Energy and Elemental Group. The FRENZ team will deliver the technical assistance, drawing on New Zealand\u2019s extensive experience in geothermal energy development. Their final action plan will provide a detailed framework for building sustainable capacity in the OECS geothermal energy sector.\nThe initiative builds on nearly a decade of New Zealand\u2019s engagement in Caribbean geothermal development and represents a significant step forward in the region\u2019s transition to renewable energy. The resulting action plan will inform future capacity-building initiatives under the OECS GEOBUILD Programme and help ensure the long-term sustainability of geothermal projects across the OECS.\nThe geothermal sector presents unique challenges for workforce development in small island states. Projects take years to develop, and opportunities for hands-on experience are limited. The collaboration with FRENZ is intended to help OECS GEOBUILD identify creative ways to build and maintain expertise even as projects progress at different speeds across different islands.\n\u201cIt is a pleasure to continue our working relationship with the OECS and build on our knowledge of geothermal energy development in the Caribbean.

Technology\n# Interview \u2013 How Gradient Geothermal taps into the geothermal potential of oilfields\n!Interview \u2013 How Gradient Geothermal taps into the geothermal potential of oilfields Interview - How Gradient Geothermal taps into the geothermal potential of oilfields\n![ ](\n![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 13 Jan 2025\nIn this interview, Benjamin Burke of Gradient Geothermal tells us about geothermal power production in oilfields using proprietary technologies.\n![](\n![](\n![](\nA lot has already been said about high drilling costs and resource discovery risk being two of the major barriers to widespread adoption of geothermal. Colorado-based\nThe company had recently announced the deployment of their HXC Geothermal System technology to generate geothermal power at the oil and gas assets of Chord Energy in North Dakota. Sufficiently intrigued, we caught up with Benjamin Burke\n#### Harnessing the geothermal energy of oil and gas fields\nThe business of Gradient Geothermal (Gradient) can be briefly summarized as the deployment of modular, mobile geothermal units into oil fields to generate power and provide cooling services. This fulfills two objectives \u2013 fluid cooling, which consumes a lot of power in oil and gas production, and geothermal power generation. With the technology of Gradient, operators can benefit from carbon emissions reduction, reduced utility costs, and the availability of a more resilient power source.\n\u201cIn either case, we generate power, but we can really flexibly meet the goals of our clients,\u201d\u201cGeothermal is a great vehicle for them to achieve all those goals.\u201d\n\u201cFor most of our clients, the geothermal power they generate on site means that they are consuming less from the grid, or will need to generate less power from diesel or natural gas. There is value in terms of both offsetting carbon emissions and having affordable and reliable power generated onsite.\nGradient is also exploring the possibility of supplying heat from their technology under a cascading use model, where residual heat from power generation can be utilized by the operator or a partner. A partner under this model can be in the industry of agribusiness, aquaculture, industrial drying, or any of a number of conventional direct heat users. There is a limitation in that these facilities have to be located close to the oilfield, but the company is looking forward to partner with different industries.\n#### Flexible and easy-to-deploy technology\nThe patented HXC sled is at the heart of the oilfield solutions that Gradient is offering. The sled comprises a heat exchanger, an ORC unit, and a dry cooler. The system was designed to be modular, ruggedized, and able to handle different types of fluid with no pre-treatment requirements. This allows the technology to be deployed in challenging fluid conditions, or even in temperatures that are not very high.\n\u201cWe do work with our clients on a pre-qualification process, but the hurdle is not terribly high,\u201d\n![]( of the HXC Geothermal System by Gradient Geothermal (source: Gradient Geothermal)\nThe preferred areas for power generation have temperatures of over 200 \u00b0F (93 \u00b0C), but the technology can work with temperatures of at least 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C). In terms of flowrate, Gradient needs at least about 2000 barrels per day, or equivalent to 3.2 liters per second for power generation. In case flowrate from one well is not sufficient, flow from several wells in an oilfield can be aggregated to satisfy this requirement. Gradient works at oil and gas wells as well as central facilities in cases where multiple wells are used. However, this may present new challenges.\n\u201cGathering fluids far from the wellbore can result in heat loss, so we work with clients to help them understand where heat loss is occurring. If fluid aggregation is a really important aspect of the project, then we work with them to help insulate the system.\u201d\nThe technology is also not selective in terms of the water cut of the fluids. \u201cWe can use 100% water. We could use 100% oil or gas. We could use any ratio in between,\u201d\nThe heat exchanger is the only direct point of contact between the HXC sled and the well fluids. It can handle whatever is in the fluid stream from the oilfield, whether gas or solids, and thus protects all other components of the HXC sled. In general, oilfield operators treat their fluids to mitigate scaling or precipitate out undesired minerals. Whatever chemical programs the operator may implement works well with Gradient\u2019s technology.\n\u201cIf it works for the operator, then it\u2019s good for us. The fluid does not need to go under any special pre-treatment for our equipment.\u201d\nIn terms of deployment time, initial assessment for new clients can take between one to three months depending on how fast the client would like to move. Once the unit has been customized and ready to be deployed, setting up on site takes only one day. The system can start running fairly quickly, both on the electrical side and the fluid plumbing side.\n#### Lessons from the Blackburn site and future plans\nThe initial project of Gradient at the Blackburn site in Nevada operated from May 2022 to April 2024. The unit from the Blackburn site has since been transferred to North Dakota, but the Blackburn site is still active as part of the US Department of Energy Blackburn Wells of Opportunity study. This is a three-phase project with the Department of Energy which has now just moved to the second phase, which involves procurement, installation, and commissioning.\nThe Blackburn site is a conventional mature oil field that was discovered in the 1980s and is now over 99% water flow. There are a lot of a lot of oil fields like it around the world and in the US. The Blackburn project was a valuable learning experience for Gradient in terms of anticipating the surface infrastructure needed to scale up an oil field for geothermal power generation.\n\u201cGeothermal needs more thermal mass flow, and so there are fluid gathering systems, tanks, and separation vessels to consider,\u201cWe also had to consider the existing infrastructure in the field. Some of it may only need to be augmented rather than be replaced. Going through all these factors with the operator and looking at what can be augmented or replaced was a really big learning for us, and we are excited to share this with the public.\u201d\n![]( Geothermal\u2019s two sled solution for power generation in oilfield is seen here at the central facility of Blackburn oil field, Nevada. Gradient received an award from the US Department of Energy to implement up to 1 MW of power generation at Blackburn. (source: Gradient Geothermal)\nThroughout the course of the feasibility study in Blackburn, several trials were done to optimize power generation of the 175-kW nameplate unit on site. At maximum power generation, the team was able to attain about 2\/3 of the capacity of the power generation unit. The next goal for Gradient is to scale up the flow and optimize the location of the unit to attain 250 kw of net power generation or just over 300 kW of gross power generation.\nThe mission for the Blackburn project is to demonstrate the pathway to 1 MW geothermal power generation in an existing oilfield. Gradient has done plenty of surface and subsurface work to document the various scenarios and challenges taking oilfields across the US and scaling them up for geothermal production, or for an end-of-life oilfield to continue on as a geothermal field. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned a ton and we are excited to share that with the DOE and the public as we go forward,\u201d\n#### Projects in North Dakota\nAs mentioned, Gradient has since deployed their technology at an oilfield in North Dakota operated by Chord Energy. However, the company has also started work with other operators in the Basin region.\nWith these new projects, Gradient continues to gain more experience that help improve their technologies and processes. For instance, working with new wells can be very different from working with wells that have been around for more than 40 years. \u201cIn some cases, you can get a lot of sand flow or other kinds of debris flowing up new wells. Learning how to handle solids has been a big part of our experience.\u201d\n\u201cOur units are very adaptable. We have no problem handling abrupt changes in flow rates and temperatures.\u201d\nWorking in extremely cold conditions with geothermal fluids at temperatures below 0 \u00b0C also meant that the team had to be ready for freezing conditions in case of discontinuous flow. \u201cThe same challenges that other operators find in North Dakota in the oil and gas realm are going to be geothermal challenges as well. Everything\u2019s great when the whole system is hot, but if the site has to shut in for a while, you have to be ready for freezing conditions. We had to work to make sure our unit was ready for those with glycol in the HXC.\u201d\n#### What else is in the future for Gradient Geothermal?\nGradient has some other projects currently in the pre-operations phase outside the United States. Within the US, the company is particularly excited about a thermal energy network project in Pierce, Colorado, for which Gradient received a grant from the state energy office.\nGradient will be doing a feasibility study in the town of Pierce, a small eastern plains town that has hosted an oil field since 1951. That oilfield has been played out, and now the operator is looking for another life for the field. Thus, there is an opportunity to utilize the oilfield to provide heat to local residents and businesses. This is an example where there is a very large direct thermal energy opportunity.\nAdditionally, the company is looking into other realms as part of their larger business plan. The company is considering going beyond the business of leasing their technology, and possibly growing into owning and operating oilfields, power facilities, and selling electricity to the grid or directly to end-users through PPAs.\n![]( Sedillos, Chief Engineering Officer of Gradient Geothermal, at the Nevada (left) and North Dakota (right) sites (source: Gradient Geothermal)\n#### Focusing on technology that already exists\nBurke states that in the US alone, there are just under 2.9 million wells that are both currently operating and wells that have operated that can be re-entered. Of that, about a half million are wells that have the wellbore integrity and the heat and flowrate, possibly through aggregation, for geothermal power generation. This amounts to electricity generation potential of about 13 GW.\n\u201cWe look not only at individual wells, but individual field opportunities,\u201d\u201cThat really covers the whole US, from the Appalachian Basin in the east, to the entire Gulf Coast Basin. There are a number of basins in the Midwest, from Oklahoma all the way up to North Dakota, smaller Rockies basins and out into California and parts of Nevada.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s just thinking from a stable power generation standpoint. When we bring fluid cooling into the models, then more wells and more opportunities come forward. There are also similar geologic conditions in Canada, and in parts of South America and Africa.\n\u201cWe see a really rosy future for sedimentary geothermal or oilfield geothermal, if you will. The repeatability across the world is quite strong.\u201d\nLow-temperature geothermal is also increasingly becoming more accessible with improving capabilities and lower prices of ORC units. Equipment costs have come down significantly in the last 10 or 15 years, providing more opportunities to harness geothermal resources at lower than 74 \u00b0C.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting what the geothermal industry is doing with efforts to tap into ultradeep and ultra hot resources. That ecosystem of innovation is fantastic,\u201d\u201cLow-temperature geothermal is the market niche that we have staked for ourselves, and we\u2019re similarly excited about what we can do with this technology.\u201d\nAccording to Burke, it was a concerted business decision to focus on technologies that already exist and are already well-established. \u201cWe wanted to tell our investors that we are ready to go now. The technology is here now. This is not a science project. We can go out and generate electrons.\u201d\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards 23 Oct 2025 Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Arup 13 Oct 2025 Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Aru ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress 10 Oct 2025 Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya 6 Oct 2025 Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa 2 Oct 2025 The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels 24 Sep 2025 Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France 18 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! 17 Sep 2025 One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest 15 Sep 2025 Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees 12 Sep 2025 Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Eight of these geothermal concessions were set to expire by 2024, but the company was given a one-year extension until 31 December 2025. The decision was highly criticized, as the one-year extension was not compatible with the investment horizon for geothermal projects.\nIn late 2023, Enel presented a EUR 3 billion investment plan for Italy\u2019s geothermal sector, with plans of building two new power plants by 2030. However, the plan was contingent on the company receiving a substantial extension on their existing concessions.\nOver the next months, the regional council requested the geothermal developer and operator to present plans and timetables for maintenance and technological improvement to guarantee the efficiency of the power plants. The investment plan will also include EUR 30 million in contributions per year for the municipalities, which will then go towards the building of roads, schools, and sports facilities.\nThis is a positive development for Italy\u2019s geothermal sector, which has been at a standstill for about a decade.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

is a strong candidate for powering AI-driven data centers:\n* High Reliability \u2013 Unlike wind and solar, geothermal operates 24\/7 with a capacity factor above 90%.\n* Lower Costs \u2013 Locating data centers near geothermal resources could reduce electricity costs by 31-45%.\n* Reduced Carbon Footprint \u2013 Geothermal provides firm, zero-carbon energy, helping companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google meet their clean energy targets.\nOvercoming Barriers to Geothermal Expansion\nTo fully realize geothermal\u2019s potential for data centers, the report outlines key challenges:\n* Permitting Delays \u2013 Federal approvals for geothermal projects can take 7-10 years, hindering development.\n* Grid Connection Bottlenecks \u2013 Many geothermal projects face long wait times for interconnection.\n* Financing Gaps \u2013 Despite its potential, geothermal still faces funding challenges compared to solar and wind.\nThe report urges policymakers and tech companies to support regulatory reforms, investment incentives, and faster permitting to accelerate geothermal adoption.\nThe path forward: geothermal-driven data centers\nIf AI companies prioritize siting data centers near geothermal resources, geothermal energy could meet 100% of projected demand growth while cutting costs and emissions.\nWith strong policy support and industry investment, geothermal could become a cornerstone of sustainable AI infrastructure, ensuring energy security and clean growth in the digital era.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming

Te Huka 3 is expected to be fully online by the end of 2024.\nFirst announced in 2022, Te Huka 3 was built with an investment of NZ$300 million and is designed to be one of the first 100% carbon-neutral geothermal power stations in the world. The binary cycle power station uses a process where geothermal fluid is split into steam and liquid, which are then both utilized to heat up the pentane to drive the turbine. All of the site\u2019s potential emissions will be reinjected back into the reservoir.\n\u201cThis marks a huge moment for the team at Te Huka 3, who have, for the past two years, worked tirelessly from the initial ground-breaking on site to building a fully operational renewable power station. That is no mean feat,\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really exciting time for geothermal energy,\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s often been the unsung hero of power, but now it is really coming into its own as it plays a crucial role in New Zealand\u2019s transition away from fossil fuels while helping to keep the lights on.\u201d\nTe Huka 3 will thus be the second geothermal power station that Contact Energy brings online this year, following the commissioning of Tauhara in August. Together, the two facilities will have a combined installed capacity of 203.4 MW, which will be a very significant contribution to the total global installed geothermal power capacity for this year.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya 28 Oct 2025 Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area 27 Oct 2025 Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines 22 Oct 2025 EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia 20 Oct 2025 Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia 17 Oct 2025 Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation 16 Oct 2025 China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated 16 Oct 2025 Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia 8 Oct 2025 Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia 3 Oct 2025 Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

To overcome these limitations, thepower of laser energy combined with cryogenic gas\nThe overall aim of DeepU\nThe proposed technology is being tested at the laboratory scale in different rock types to verify its ability to liquefy and vitrify rock, ensuring the borehole is ready for heat exchange immediately after drilling. Laboratory demonstrations provide crucial data to assess the technological, environmental and economic sustainability of the proposed solution, while also defining its potential and commercial viability.\nThe high-risk innovation presented in DeepU has the potential to make geothermal energy system accessible everywhere in a targeted and demand-oriented manner, offering a complementary approach and an alternative solution to traditional energy storage and production, decentralising the power supply also in areas where this is currently deemed uneconomic.\nDeepU has been funded by the European Commission under the EIC Pathfinder Programme (G.A. 101046937) as part of Horizon Europe. Eng. Luc Pockel\u00e9 coordinates the project from the RED srl in collaboration with partners from four countries: the University of Padua (Italy), Prevent GmbH (Germany), Fraunhofer IAPT (Germany), GeoServ (Ireland), The Wroclaw University of Science and Technology (Poland), and the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche IGG (Italy). The project will run until October 2025.\n#### Does deep drilling need a revolution?\nJust recently, the DeepU project held a webinar titled \u201cDoes deep drilling need a revolution?\u201ddeep drilling technologies while initiating a discussion on the breakthroughs necessary to access ultra-deep geothermal resources. Central to the conversation was the pioneering technology proposed by DeepU \u2013 its approach combines high-power lasers and cryogenic gas to penetrate the most challenging rock formations.\nThe project partners showcased cutting-edge, innovative drilling technologies while emphasizing the advantages of non-mechanical drilling. They shared significant findings from the DeepU project that demonstrate, on a laboratory level, the potential of laser drilling technology to address the limitations of conventional methods.\nThe research investigates how lasers interact with rock, revealing that thermal spallation, melting, and vaporization occur simultaneously, albeit with varying intensities based on rock type, power density, and irradiation duration. Notably, thermal spallation is the most promising to produce usable diameter wells, with drilling rates ranging from 5 to 15 meters per hour.\nThe team has selected supercritical nitrogen as the flushing medium for deep borehole drilling due to its thermodynamic properties and effectiveness in removing cuttings. They developed a numerical model to determine the necessary pressure and flow rates for different borehole depths, which is being validated through a dedicated test rig.\nThe proposed system involves storing liquid nitrogen, compressing it to high pressures (up to 350 bars), and delivering it down the borehole through a specially designed channel with vacuum insulation. Among the challenges discussed regarding the technology is the need for integration with existing drilling equipment and practices.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![\u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 28 Oct 2025 \u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The first is an external digital sculpture made of two large LED screen on which videos and images will tell the story of geothermal heat from its deep original to surface manifestations such as geysers, fumaroles, and hot springs. The second area will showcase the applications of geothermal energy in Italy and the its role in the energy transition.\nA centerpiece of the exhibition is the simulation of a fumarolic event that offers a unique multisensory experience showing the natural phenomena in geothermal areas.\nAnother part of the exhibition displays rocks collected from 1000 meters deep from the geothermal reservoirs of the Larderello fields, the oldest geothermal complex in the world. The geothermal power plants in Larderello are operated by Enel Green Power, who also provided the rocks for the exhibition.\nAlthough Italy remains a major player in the global geothermal power sector, the industry has remained stagnant for the last decade owing to insufficient regulatory and market support. However, positive developments have happened in recent months, including the 20-year extension of the geothermal concessions of Enel Green Power, paving the way for further investment.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University 2 Oct 2025 PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![New free online course on shallow geothermal energy available on edX 30 Sep 2025 New free online course on shallow geothermal energy available on edX ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France 18 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest 15 Sep 2025 Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![TEDx talk highlights the global geothermal energy opportunity 15 Sep 2025 TEDx talk highlights the global geothermal energy opportunity ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees 12 Sep 2025 Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Your input needed \u2013 Survey on Geothermal Education Opportunities 8 Sep 2025 Your input needed \u2013 Survey on Geothermal Education Opportunities ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Free workshop on Volsung by Seequent, 6 October 2025, Zurich 5 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Free workshop on Volsung by Seequent, 6 October 2025, Zurich ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Course on Risk & uncertainty for geothermal projects; Ankara, T\u00fcrkiye 3 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Course on Risk & uncertainty for geothermal projects; Ankara, T\u00fcrkiy ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling completed for geothermal heating in Garges-l\u00e8s-Gonesse, France 28 Aug 2025 Drilling completed for geothermal heating in Garges-l\u00e8s-Gonesse, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![UK universities strengthen seismic imaging research with STRYDE nodes 27 Aug 2025 UK universities strengthen seismic imaging research with STRYDE nodes ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

For more than ten years, data from these projects were uploaded to the GDR for public use, resulting in 1,268 datasets and 287 TB of data.\nAs more data is uploaded to the site, the GDR team addresses accessibility at multiple levels, and the ability to discover the data is just the first step.\n\u201cA deeper level of accessibility is being able to use the data in a meaningful way, making sure that all the necessary contextual information is there to use the data effectively,\u201d\nThe AskGDR virtual research assistant allows users to access relevant datasets and supporting documents by making more intuitive queries, and not just keyword searches.\n#### Making geothermal data available to all\nThis latest measure is part of one of the objectives of GDR \u2013 to ensure that geothermal data is available to people and communities regardless of location or sector. Another level of accessibility is the integration of GDR with DOE\u2019s Open Energy Data Initiative (OEDI), which allows massive datasets to live in the cloud.\n\u201cBy putting these large data sets in the cloud, we\u2019ve made them truly accessible. Previously when working with big data, you were inadvertently limiting your ability to collaborate to institutions that could handle that, like a large lab or a Fortune 500 company,\u201d\n\u201cBut now because the GDR is integrated with OEDI, it\u2019s in the cloud and that opens the door for a wider array of institutions and organizations like smaller universities, high schools, startup companies and other sources of innovation.\u201d\nBy facilitating equal accessibility, the GDR can support historically under-resourced communities as well as those that lack access to larger scientific communities. Making this information public and free to download means that the data collected in one community can help another explore sustainable and clean energy resources.\nThrough the GDR, GTO is meeting its commitment to data accessibility and continually improving ways to find and use data more quickly, broadly, and efficiently. This directory houses data with far-reaching impact, fueling innovation, promoting scientific discovery, and supporting the global scientific community.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![SLB and Ormat partner to fast-track development of integrated geothermal assets 27 Oct 2025 SLB and Ormat partner to fast-track development of integrated geothermal assets ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development 27 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![BLM Nevada geothermal lease sale nets over USD 9 million in bids on 86 parcels 23 Oct 2025 BLM Nevada geothermal lease sale nets over USD 9 million in bids on 86 parcels ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program 22 Oct 2025 Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards 17 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program 15 Oct 2025 California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University 2 Oct 2025 PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Turboden to deliver ORC systems for Phase II of Cape Station geothermal project in Utah 2 Oct 2025 Turboden to deliver ORC systems for Phase II of Cape Station geothermal project in Utah ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![XGS Energy completes 3000-hour operations of geothermal technology in Coso, California 30 Sep 2025 XGS Energy completes 3000-hour operations of geothermal technology in Coso, California ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells 25 Sep 2025 Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Quaise holds public demonstration of millimeter wave technology for geothermal drilling 22 Sep 2025 Quaise holds public demonstration of millimeter wave technology for geothermal drilling ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Technology\n# Redefining geothermal power generation with the Plain Bearings Turbine (PBT)\n!Redefining geothermal power generation with the Plain Bearings Turbine \\(PBT\\) The Plain Bearings Turbine by Ormat Technologies Inc (source: inset image by Ormat)\n![ ](\n![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 14 Oct 2024\nThe new Plain Bearings Turbine (PBT) by Ormat aims to make geothermal power plants more efficient, simplify maintenance, and reduce downtime.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nGlobal geothermal developer and operator and technology leader\nWith this new addition in their portfolio, Ormat is again pushing the boundaries of technology to contribute to the growth of the geothermal power generation sector.\nTo learn more about the PBT and the operating principles behind it, we spoke with Nirit Grushko, Senior VP of Innovation, R&D, and Engineering and Alex Katz, Senior R&D Engineer of Ormat.\n#### Simplified maintenance and reduced downtime\nThe value proposition of the PBT is quite simple and straightforward \u2013 it is a turbine that requires maintenance only once in 10 years. Even when maintenance has to be done, the new design allows it to be done much simpler and quicker than industry standards.\nWhat is about the PBT that gives it this advantage? A standard overhung turbine has a set of bearings located on the generator side. To service or replace those bearings during maintenance, the turbine must be opened. While performed only every few years, this job requires substantial downtime.\nIn contrast, the PBT has both bearing assemblies located at points of the turbine that can be accessed externally. The PBT also makes use of robust hydrodynamic bearings (instead of the standard roller bearings), which theoretically will outlive the standard life of geothermal power plants.\nThe mechanical seal of the turbine \u2013 also one of its common points of failure \u2013 is also externally accessible. In addition, the design exposes the seal to lower temperatures, thus extending its useful life.\n![]( of turbine (source: Ormat)\nThe result is a turbine that can undergo maintenance only once every 10 years, instead of the standard 4 to 7 years recommended for standard turbines. This period can be stretched out longer if there are no indicators that the turbine needs maintenance.\nAnother gain from the design is that the turbine no longer needs to be evacuated during maintenance. This is crucial when handling the binary fluid medium in ORC power plants. Not only does this avoid potential emissions of hydrocarbon compounds, but also makes the maintenance process easier for personnel\n#### More flexible operations\nAlthough designed for ORC power plants, the higher capacity, ease of maintenance, and efficiency of the PBT mean that it can compete with steam turbines.\nThe capacity of the PBT caps at 50 MW, mostly because two of these reach the limit of the generators used in the binary market. However, smaller capacity PBTs can be supplied. Ormat currently has a prototype with an installed nominal power capacity of only 5 MW.\nWhereas most turbines currently in the market support a maximum of 5 stages, the PBT design expands this possibility to 7 stages. This provides additional operational flexibility suitable to a wider geothermal market.\nOrmat is currently focusing on targeting the high-temperature geothermal market, such as in Indonesia and New Zealand, for the PBT. This is a bold move as ORC turbines are typically utilized for low-temperature geothermal resources or the residual heat from the bottom stream of a steam turbine.\n#### Innovation as an iterative process\nAs a vertically integrated geothermal company with decades of experience, Ormat\u2019s dual roles as an operator and engineering company have both played crucial roles in coming up with innovative products like the PBT.\n\u201cAs an operator, all the things that hurt our customers hurt us as well. These include downtimes, maintenance, accessibility, time to evacuate, and emissions,\u201d\n![]( Diablo 4 geothermal power plant, Mammoth Complex, California (source: Ormat)\nAs a provider of technology and engineering solutions, Ormat develops products that build upon older products and lessons. In the case of the PBT, the design was based on improvements of at least two of their older turbine designs. By taking inspiration and lessons from past products, Ormat is able to refine the designs and take advantage of this iterative loop of innovations and constant improvement.\n#### \u201cIf the challenge is easy, then it\u2019s not a challenge.\u201d\n\u201cOrmat has been around now for over 60 years, and we want to still be the leading company in geothermal for the next 60 years,\u201d\n\u201cTo keep our engineers curious, engaged, and motivated, we need to give them challenges. And if the challenge is easy, then it\u2019s not a challenge,\u201d\nThe company presents its engineers with a major challenge that initially seems impossible to achieve. To support them, they are provided with various tools, including training in systematic innovation thinking, design and entrepreneurial thinking, attendance at conferences, participation in roundtable discussions, and brainstorming sessions. This culture of continuous learning and collaboration was key to making the groundbreaking turbine design a reality.\n#### Reducing the costs of geothermal\nThe new PBT is part of Ormat\u2019s campaign to make geothermal more competitive by reducing costs. This not only involves reducing drilling costs, but also making power plants more efficient and reducing costs associated to manufacturing, design, and construction.\nOrmat maintains a very active pipeline of R & D projects addressing just about very major engineering challenge in geothermal. With its global footprint, access to different geothermal markets, and a company culture built on innovation, we likely will hear more groundbreaking product launches from Ormat in the near future.\nFor more information on the Plain Bearings Turbine, check out this video published by Ormat:\n?\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards 23 Oct 2025 Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Arup 13 Oct 2025 Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Aru ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress 10 Oct 2025 Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya 6 Oct 2025 Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa 2 Oct 2025 The prominent role of GSHP in the UK geothermal sector \u2013 Tamsin Lishman, CEO of Kensa ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels 24 Sep 2025 Our Climate Future 2025: Iceland-EU symposium on geothermal energy in Brussels ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France 18 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! 17 Sep 2025 One week left \u2013 Register for the European Geothermal Congress 2025 now! ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest 15 Sep 2025 Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees 12 Sep 2025 Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The discipline of geothermal well construction also needs robust and universal standards, better project management, and technological innovations.\nWe interviewed Kevin Gray and Daria Ivakhnenko to learn more about Black Reiver\u2019s role in the geothermal industry and their sentiment on Ukraine\u2019s geothermal potential.\n#### Improving the standards of geothermal drilling\nThirteen years ago, Black Reiver was founded to provide petroleum expertise and training. Kevin is approaching 35 years of experience in drilling, while Daria has over 20 years of experience in technical translation, training and standards.\nSeveral years ago, the company expanded into geothermal. The move was motivated by observing poor drilling performance and project management in many geothermal projects. The move will support the global transition to more sustainable energy. The company saw this as an opportunity to bring its bread and butter\u2014improving drilling performance and technologies\u2014into the geothermal sector.\nThe more the company transitioned to geothermal, the more clients\u2019 needs grew. Black Reiver Consulting gathered a team of experts to meet this demand, partnering with Tony Pink and contracting geoscientists Ben Adams and Lucy Cotton. The company now has a team with a second-to-none technical background, with competencies in seismic interpretation and reservoir modelling complementing their combined drilling expertise.\n![]( Gray, Ben Adams, and Daria Ivakhnenko of Black Reiver Consulting (source: Fred Boer \/ Black Reiver Consulting)\n\u201cWhat we are doing right now is a lot of due diligence in projects and technologies for potential investors,\u201d\n#### Translation of \u201cOur Hidden Powers\u201d\nBlack Reiver joined the EGEC at the same time as Baseload Capital. This coincidence allowed the two companies to interact and explore collaboration, eventually paving the way for a Ukrainian translation of the \u201cOur Hidden Powers\u201d children\u2019s book.\nA key part of this collaboration was Daria, who specializes in translating and interpreting technical training courses, regulations, and standards and consulting as a linguistic expert for Black Reiver. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite my cup of tea, but I have a daughter, so I hope I know how to talk to children,\u201d\nDaria emphasized that the geothermal industry in Ukraine is at a very early stage of development. Thus, it is even more important to start educating people about renewable energy to give them an idea about its place in the country\u2019s and the world\u2019s energy structures.\n![]( Ukrainian translation of \u201cOur Hidden Powers.\u201d The book is distributed by local NGO Geothermal Ukraine.\nThe children\u2019s book may be useful for parents who know little about the energy industry. It is written in simple language and comes with lovely illustrations. With the translation, geothermal energy can become less of a mystery to children and adults in Ukraine.\nSupporting energy education in Ukraine is now more important than ever. Just a few weeks ago, the Russians attacked the Ivano-Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas. Black Reiver was scheduled to deliver a training course there, and the university was also originally the venue of the Ukrainian geothermal conference.\n\u201cThey want to kill academia and knowledge in the industry, so we have to work to counteract it,\u201d c\n#### Ukraine at an excellent position for geothermal growth\nGeothermal in Ukraine, being at an early stage of development, has its advantages. It means that Ukraine has plenty of lessons from projects globally to learn from and plenty of proven technologies to choose from. It also means that they do not have to repeat the mistakes that others have made.\nRussian attacks have heavily damaged Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure. When the war is over, this infrastructure will have to be rebuilt. Geothermal provides compelling value as an energy installation that will be very difficult to destroy beyond repair, unlike nuclear or coal.\nOne of Ukraine\u2019s many notable achievements was its ability to sell electricity abroad, even during wartime.\nUkraine also has a large human capital for well construction. The drilling industry in Ukraine dates back to the end of the 19th century. The local drilling industry may not be the most edge-cutting in the world, but plenty of people in Ukraine know how to drill a well.\nAn existing energy export mechanism, a relatively low-cost base, and a large human capital for drilling make geothermal energy in Ukraine worth investing in.\n#### Establishing new standards in geothermal drilling\nKevin, Daria, and Tony are involved in developing geothermal well classification as part of the\nThis effort aims to bring some order into geothermal drilling by setting unified definitions and standards to create clear and transparent guidelines that can be used by project developers, investors, shareholders, and regulators worldwide.\nThe IADC is expected to make presentations and give updates on the progress of its work on establishing these standards.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University 2 Oct 2025 PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![New free online course on shallow geothermal energy available on edX 30 Sep 2025 New free online course on shallow geothermal energy available on edX ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France 18 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Masterclass on Geothermal Energy by EAGE, 17-20 Nov 2025, Paris, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest 15 Sep 2025 Hungary builds capacity through the first Geothermal Short Course in Budapest ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![TEDx talk highlights the global geothermal energy opportunity 15 Sep 2025 TEDx talk highlights the global geothermal energy opportunity ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees 12 Sep 2025 Praxisforum event to host free geothermal career forum for students and trainees ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Your input needed \u2013 Survey on Geothermal Education Opportunities 8 Sep 2025 Your input needed \u2013 Survey on Geothermal Education Opportunities ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Free workshop on Volsung by Seequent, 6 October 2025, Zurich 5 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Free workshop on Volsung by Seequent, 6 October 2025, Zurich ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 Course on Risk & uncertainty for geothermal projects; Ankara, T\u00fcrkiye 3 Sep 2025 Registration open \u2013 Course on Risk & uncertainty for geothermal projects; Ankara, T\u00fcrkiy ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling completed for geothermal heating in Garges-l\u00e8s-Gonesse, France 28 Aug 2025 Drilling completed for geothermal heating in Garges-l\u00e8s-Gonesse, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![UK universities strengthen seismic imaging research with STRYDE nodes 27 Aug 2025 UK universities strengthen seismic imaging research with STRYDE nodes ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

However, additional approvals will still be needed for drilling to commence, which is expected to take anywhere between five to eight years.\nThe two properties being eyed for geothermal drilling had previously been designated in the regional plan as \u201cpriority area for agriculture\u201d and \u201cregional green belt.\u201d To make drilling possible, the local council initiated a target deviation procedure (\u201cZielabweichungsverfahren\u201d) for the area which will allow developers to deviate from the original objective for the location.\nBased on an evaluation of existing geological data,\nThe selected project site is located far from the community, so no residents will be affected by noise, steam, or light from the geothermal operations. Moreover, the eastern side of the project site borders no nature reserves, the project can be developed without effects on any protected areas.\nSusan Weber of Deutsche Erdw\u00e4rme is optimistic that the project can be developed and that the geothermal resources at the site can be used for 30 to 40 years. The company is currently developing the Graben-Neudorf geothermal site where geothermal waters at more than 200 \u00b0C have been found.\nHowever, additional approvals will still be needed before drilling can begin in R\u00fclzheim. The local council has expressed support for the project, but the municipal council will still need to approve. The Structural and Approval Directorate (SGD) will then give their decision on whether drilling can begin.

Photo courtesy of Innargi's Jesper Gi\u00f8rtz-Behrens\n![ ](\n![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 11 Apr 2025\nSeismic surveys done in large cities in Denmark have highlighted the flexibility of the technology, facilitating rapid data gathering and project development.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nGeothermal energy is playing a crucial role in decarbonizing district heating. At the forefront of this transition is\nWith the economics of geothermal energy demanding a swift transition from design to heat production, where tighter budgets necessitate faster project timelines, Innargi is setting a new benchmark for this with two large-scale geothermal projects in the city center of Aarhus and North of Copenhagen.\nImpressively, their first geothermal plant in Aarhus is planned to deliver its first heat in September 2025, just 26 months after the seismic acquisition ended\u2014showcasing the speed and efficiency needed to make geothermal a scalable and impactful clean energy solution.\nOnce completed, these projects will collectively deliver over 130 MW of heating through 19 geothermal wells, reducing CO2 emissions by more than 165,000 tonnes annually.\nEmil St\u00fcrup-Toft, Lead Geoscientist at Innargi, and Claudio Strobbia, Chief Research Scientist and CEO of\n#### The importance and impact of the seismic data\n\u201cBefore acquiring seismic data, we were operating with limited subsurface knowledge in Copenhagen. We knew geothermal potential existed\u2014thanks to a well drilled 25 years ago that had performed beyond expectations \u2014but we lacked certainty about the extent of the geothermal system. Seismic wasn\u2019t a deciding factor in whether to pursue the project, but rather a crucial tool to confirm our geological model.\u201dEmil explained.\n_\u201cWe needed to verify whether the productive system extended far enough north and south, as we had hoped. We also knew a basin-bounding fault ran through the center of Copenhagen, but we required precise imaging of its location, as this fault significantly influences geothermal potential on the city\u2019s eastern and western sides._\n_\u201cSeismic data proved invaluable in identifying areas with geothermal potential and refining our understanding of the system\u2019s extent. A positive surprise was that the system stretched even farther than expected, both north and south, reinforcing confidence in our development plans._\nEmil also commented on the need for seismic in Aarhus:_\u201cIn Aarhus, the seismic survey played a critical role in refining our drilling strategy within the pre-selected area for geothermal development. With the site already contracted, the data was essential for pinpointing the most suitable drilling locations, ensuring optimal well placement, and minimizing geological risks._\n_\u201cThe seismic data helped us avoid potential hazards, ensuring we didn\u2019t accidentally drill into a fault, which could have had undesirable consequences, ranging from increased operational costs and reduced reservoir efficiency to potential loss of well integrity.\u201d_\n![]( example of the seismic data that Innargi acquired (from Holb\u00e6k). Photo courtesy of Innargi.\n#### Acquiring seismic in densely populated and complex cities\nUrban seismic acquisition presents a unique set of challenges, and the projects in Copenhagen and Aarhus were no exception. Conducting surveys in the heart of these large cities meant navigating narrow streets, historic landmarks, underground metro lines, and a complex network of utilities. Ensuring minimal disruption to residents, businesses, and infrastructure was a top priority for Innargi.\n_\u201cIn the most densely populated areas of Denmark, in the height of summer, where tourism activity added to the complexity of our operations, we placed seismic receiver nodes across the city centres, including in front of landmarks like Tivoli Park and the Danish Parliament,\u201d_ explained Emil. _\u201cIt was one of the most challenging environments you can imagine for good quality seismic acquisition.\u201d_\nSecuring approvals and gaining buy-in from local stakeholders before the survey began was relatively seamless, thanks to the proactive communication strategy applied, the modern technology used during the survey, and their flexible approach to survey design and acquisition operations.\nTo address any public concerns, Innargi leveraged TV, radio, and newspapers to inform the public, reassure them about how minimally invasive the survey would be, and emphasize the long-term benefits of clean heating that would be available to them in just a few years. This transparent approach led to minimal concerns from the public during the acquisition phase.\nThe use of\nTo further minimize disruption, Innargi reduced source efforts near historic and vulnerable buildings and conducted operations at night, ensuring minimal disturbance to the local community.\nAs a result, the survey was virtually invisible to most passersby or local residents. The only indication that a survey was taking place was when the Vibroseis trucks passed quickly through the streets at night for the source operations.\n_\u201cWe were pleasantly surprised by how few nodes were tampered with,\u201d_ Emil noted._\u201cPeople were curious but generally respectful. Some even mailed back nodes they had picked up!\u201d_\n![]( STRYDE node deployed on the streets of Copenhagen with Vibroseis trucks operating at night.\n#### Ensuring high-resolution seismic data was acquired and delivered quickly\n_\u201cThe ability to deploy a dense seismic node network without disrupting road traffic or daily life in the city was crucial.\u201d_ said Claudio Strobbia from RTS. \u201cWe leveraged our fleet of STRYDE nodes to acquire the data efficiently.\u201d\nThanks to the compact size and autonomous functionality of these nodes, RTS was able to deploy a high-density array with just 10 meters between each node, all while avoiding additional costs. This dense array, combined with nighttime operations to minimize anthropogenic noise interference, resulted in data quality that exceeded expectations.\n\u201cIn our experience, urban environments are notoriously challenging for seismic acquisition, but the results we obtained on these two surveys were exceptional. The combination of a dense receiver grid, long offsets, and optimized source effort enabled us to produce highly accurate subsurface images.\u201dadded Claudio.\nOnce the data was acquired, RTS processed it with exceptional speed, delivering high-resolution seismic images for Innargi in record time. These insights played a crucial role in refining the geological model, mapping fault lines, and pinpointing the most promising locations for geothermal wells.\nRTS migrated images just hours after acquisition to conduct initial checks, with full processing completed within weeks. For the Copenhagen survey, operations wrapped up mid-June, and by mid-July, Emil, and his team were already reviewing the initial data, with the final processed versions and report completed by August.\nRTS\u2019s approach contrasts sharply with traditional, larger processing firms, where the process is often found to be slower. \u201cWorking with RTS, I experienced a highly interactive and tailored service, ensuring that queries were resolved quickly, rather than waiting for weeks on end to see results.\u201d .\n#### The impact on Denmark\u2019s energy future\nThe success of these seismic campaigns has already translated into real-world impact. In Aarhus, Innargi\u2019s first geothermal facility, informed by the seismic survey, is set to begin producing heat in September 2025. In Copenhagen, the data has guided site selection, which will ensure that future geothermal wells are optimally placed for maximum efficiency and longevity.\n_\u201cThis was a hugely rewarding project,\u201d_ Emil reflected. \u201cSeeing something that started as an idea on paper transform into a fully operational geothermal plant is incredibly exciting.\u201d\n#### Learnings for future urban geothermal exploration\nThe success of these projects highlights the transformative impact of full transparency with local communities, adaptable survey design and operations, autonomous seismic technology, and advanced data processing in urban geothermal exploration.\nOne of the most critical factors affecting data integrity is shot point gaps. \u201cIn urban environments like Copenhagen and Aarhus, access constraints, road bends, and infrastructure limitations made it challenging to achieve consistent shot point coverage. While missing a few nodes in a dense receiver layout is manageable through regularisation, larger gaps in shot points are much harder to compensate for, making it essential to minimize them wherever possible.\u201d\n![]( trucks parked outside Copenhagen. Photo courtesy of Innargi\u2019s Jesper Gi\u00f8rtz-Behrens.\n_\u201cLooking back on how we could have further improved efficiency, reducing source effort and deploying two smaller fleets simultaneously could have improved shot point coverage while increasing acquisition speed and minimizing disruptions. While long offsets can provide valuable data, a 6 km offset was found to be sufficient for these geothermal targets, as longer distances resulted in diminishing returns,\u201d_ added Claudio.\nWith STRYDE\u2019s innovative nodal technology, RTS\u2019s expert seismic acquisition and processing, and Innargi\u2019s geological expertise and commitment to sustainable energy development, this project serves as a benchmark for future geothermal initiatives in densely populated regions.\nAs Europe moves toward a greener energy future, the success of these Danish projects demonstrates how advanced seismic acquisition is rapidly unlocking new opportunities in geothermal energy, helping cities transition away from fossil fuels and toward a more sustainable future.\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![\u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 28 Oct 2025 \u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

These systems can supply about five to ten times more energy per well compared to conventional hydrothermal systems. The CATF had previously published a comprehensive report on superhot rock systems, as well as an interactive map that highlights superhot rock projects around the world.\n#### The potential of superhot rock in the Middle East and Saudi Arabia\nAccording to a heat model developed by the CATF that estimates the depth to reach +400 \u00b0C temperatures, superhot rock exists across ~40% of the Middle East\u2019s land area, amounting to more than 2.5 million square kilometers, at depths between 3 km and 12.5 km. A majority of this potential is located in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n![]( total capacity potential of SHR if fully developed across countries with available heat in the Middle East (source: CATF)\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is well endowed with superhot rock resources and leads the region in total heat accessible with current or next-generation drilling technologies (estimated to be 12.5km or less). According to the model, the available heat in Saudi Arabia has the potential to provide 1,791 GWe of energy capacity, roughly equivalent to a gross revenue stream of USD 1 trillion annually.\nFully realizing the potential of superhot rock can produce enough electricity to meet the total yearly electricity demand of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This includes the electricity consumed for seawater desalination which provides about 70% of Saudi Arabia\u2019s drinking water. With over 15,000 TWh to spare, superhot rock energy can support a growing energy demand and catalyze new export-based economies of zero-carbon fuel production.\n#### Harnessing oil and gas expertise\nThe\nFor example, an intensive drilling and resource development program by well-funded consortia that include oil and gas industry players could provide the knowledge and innovation needed to develop and rapidly commercialize superhot rock energy.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The well was self-discharging at 1000 GPM, but with a high-flow pump installed, the well was modeled to produce around 5000 GPM at 330 \u00b0F (165 \u00b0C).\nThe directional well was drilled into a fracture zone at 7500-8000 feet (2286 \u2013 2438 meters) deep. It was a large-diameter well, with Zanskar optimistic that the reservoir will have exceptional productivity and flow.\nThe estimated capacity of the well is estimated to exceed 200 MWth, and will be more than enough for the 15 MWe Lightning Dock power plant. It is also positioned to become the most productive pumped geothermal well in operation in the USA.\n#### Real-world validation of Zanskar\u2019s thesis\nThis outcome of the drilling confirms the incredible potential of the Lightning Dock resource and is strong validation of part of the thesis of Zanskar \u2013 which is that hydrothermal geothermal resources (sometimes referred to as \u201cconventional\u201d) can produce far more energy than the industry has historically shown.\nThe drive to validate this thesis was part of Zanskar\u2019s reason for acquiring the Lightning Dock geothermal field from Cyrq Energy in 2024. The geothermal field was put up to sale due to underperformance issues. However, Zanskar had already collected unique data in the region and saw it as an opportunity to test their approach.\nThe new production well was drilled and tested less than 8 months after the acquisition, with the outcome as positive as the company had hoped. Zanskar remains committed to the perspective that hydrothermal resources can be more productive than previously determined by the industry, and that modern tools and technologies will help to tap deeper into these resources and target them more accurately and precisely.\nWhile Zanskar has made no pronouncement of their future plans yet, the company is determined to prove that the productive well is not a \u201cone-hit wonder\u201d for the Lightning Dock geothermal field.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![SLB and Ormat partner to fast-track development of integrated geothermal assets 27 Oct 2025 SLB and Ormat partner to fast-track development of integrated geothermal assets ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development 27 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy publishes document setting standards for sustainable geothermal development ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![BLM Nevada geothermal lease sale nets over USD 9 million in bids on 86 parcels 23 Oct 2025 BLM Nevada geothermal lease sale nets over USD 9 million in bids on 86 parcels ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program 22 Oct 2025 Dandelion Energy makes geothermal heating and cooling accessible through leasing program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards 17 Oct 2025 Fervo Energy wins Subsurface Modeling and Analysis category at Bentley 2025 Awards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program 15 Oct 2025 California passes bill to include geothermal in streamlined certification program ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University 2 Oct 2025 PhD opportunity \u2013 Subsurface energy systems and technologies, Ohio State University ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Turboden to deliver ORC systems for Phase II of Cape Station geothermal project in Utah 2 Oct 2025 Turboden to deliver ORC systems for Phase II of Cape Station geothermal project in Utah ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![XGS Energy completes 3000-hour operations of geothermal technology in Coso, California 30 Sep 2025 XGS Energy completes 3000-hour operations of geothermal technology in Coso, California ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells 25 Sep 2025 Texas Railroad Commission finalizes regulations on shallow geothermal injection wells ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Quaise holds public demonstration of millimeter wave technology for geothermal drilling 22 Sep 2025 Quaise holds public demonstration of millimeter wave technology for geothermal drilling ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

In the area where construction equipment and personnel from the Kutahya Provincial Special Administration are working, leveling of the roads between the planned parcels has been completed. Following this work, the tender process for infrastructure construction in the area was carried out.\nThe Simav TD?OSB project, established on a total area of 1,185,000 square meters, has allocated 828,502 square meters for technological greenhouses and 69,158 square meters as parcels designated for industrial facilities relevant to the specialized focus. The process of this significant investment is being coordinated by Simav District Governor B\u00fcnyamin Karaloglu.\nWith this new step taken in the Simav Organized Greenhouse Zone, the project is expected to be completed in the fall of 2025. The tender meeting held in the District Governor\u2019s Meeting Room was attended by District Governor Karaloglu, Simav Mayor K\u00fcbra Tekel Aktulun, Simav Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Seref Kazcioglu, and Zafer OSB Director G\u00f6ksel Ilgaz.\nSeven different companies participated in the tender, which determined the firms that will undertake the infrastructure work. According to the tender specifications, the completion of the drinking water, wastewater, telecommunications, and electrical infrastructure of the Geothermal-Based Greenhouse OSB is planned for the last quarter of 2025.\nJust about a month ago, the decision was made to drill a total of seven production wells and two reinjection wells to support the proposed geothermal greenhouse operations in Simav.

With this development, the company can start the design and construction of the geothermal power plant, which will also be the largest investment in the history of the Varazdin County.\nBukotermal is a public company jointly owned by the Varazdin County (85%) and the Municipality of Mali Bukovec (15%). The license will allow the company to harness energy from geothermal resources at the Lunjkovec-Kutnjak field for 25 years.\n\u201cNorthern Croatia is rich in geothermal resources, and I believe that the company Bukotermal will achieve success in the areas of research and exploitation. This project will enable the use of thermal energy, especially in the Municipality of Mali Bukovec,\u201d\n\u201cThe entire project has been designed in a meaningful and economically sustainable way,\nThe Lunjkovec-Kutnjak field was one of four geothermal concessions offered by the Croatian Hydrocarbon Agency for exploration in a bid round back in 2020. Exploration by Bukotermal thus proceeded in 2022, eventually determining a 16-MW capacity target for the planned geothermal power project. The exploration work indicated a geothermal resource with temperature of about 142 \u00b0C at a depth of 2.4 kilometers.\nAccording to the studies done by Bukotermal, the geothermal field can support a capacity of 16.5 MW of electricity and almost 90 MW of thermal energy. The plan is to use the energy for electricity production, and also use the thermal energy to support the agrothermal and tourist sectors.\nBukotermal Director Alen Pozgaj stated that work is already underway on designing the hot water pipeline that will connect the Kutnjak 1 exploration well with the Lunjkovec 1 exploration well. The drilling of a new production well is also being planned.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![\u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 28 Oct 2025 \u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The upgrade will cost around HUF 189 million (approx. USD 509,000) and will be co-financed by the local government, the Hungarian government, and the Swiss-Hungarian Cooperation Program (Swiss Fund).\nThe first thermal well in B\u00f3ly was drilled in 2004 at the city center, which was soon followed up with several additional wells. Since 2008, public institutions in B\u00f3ly have been supplied by geothermal water for heating. From 13 TJ in 2008, the amount of geothermal energy sold from the system has increased to 20 TJ. Accordingly, the total flowrate has increased from 125 to almost 200 cubic meters per year.\nD\u00e1vid Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1ri, the independent mayor of B\u00f3ly, said that the town\u2019s experience with geothermal has been very positive, but the existing geothermal system has also reached its upper limit. With this in mind, the local government drilled a new well in 2023 to increase thermal water production. The next step would be to upgrade the technology of the system, which is the goal of the newly funded project.\nThe upgrade will be funded by HUF 93 million from the local government, HUF 14 million, the Hungarian government, and another HUF 81 million from the Swiss Fund (Elsewhere in Hungary, the Swiss Fund is also supporting a geothermal project at the Bundzs\u00e1k Dezso Urban Sports Center in Kiskunhalas).\nAccording to the project description, the investment will make establish new heating centers, upgrade the current technology to be more efficient, and build an additional five kilometers of pipeline. The new pipeline will serve businesses operating in the local industrial park and will supply geothermal heat to agricultural facilities, including a greenhouse and crop drying facility.\n**RELATED: Hungary publishes national strategy to double geothermal output by 2030**\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![\u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 28 Oct 2025 \u00c7elikler to drill 11 geothermal exploration wells in two sites in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

PLN\u2019S development plan indicates a capacity of 10 MW for the future geothermal power facility. Despite the modest size, this will be more than enough for Lembata Island, which is currently supplied power from a diesel plant with a capacity of 6.5 MW and peak load of 5.7 MW.\n\u201cWe do not want Lembata to depend on diesel power plants forever. A diesel supply crisis could happen at any time, and we must have a long-term solution. Atadei Geothermal Power Plant is the answer to the future of clean and sustainable energy in this area,\u201d\n#### Local government to support land acquisition\nDuring the meeting, PLN UIP Nusra explained that they are in the process acquiring the land needed for the two planned wellpads, AT-1 in Nubahaereka Village and AT-2 in Atakore Village. Of the 18 plots needed for the wellpads for AT-1, 12 have already been acquired. The acquisition of land for AT-2 is still under negotiation.\nMichael Marrung, Land and Certification Manager at PLN UIP Nusra, stated that direction and support is needed from the local government for land acquisition to proceed smoothly and according to the appropriate regulations and requirements for community deliberation.\nRepresentatives of the Lembata Government responded that they will immediately hold mediation meetings with the landowners to facilitate the acquisition.\nFor their part, PLN UIP Nusra guarantees that all crucial permits related to the development, starting from the Geothermal Working Area (WKP) permit, the development permit, and environmental impact assessment.\nYasir, General Manager of PLN UIP Nusra, also recounted how they have continued intensive communication with local governments and other stakeholders through the years. \u201cEvery time a regional head changes, we always hold an audience so that there is continuity in the development process. This is the main key to the success of the project.\u201d\nPT PLN, through PLN East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), is aiming to develop more than 70 MW of geothermal power generation capacity in the islands of East Nusa Tenggara. Aside from Atadei, the state-owned developer is also working on the Ulumbu, Sokoria, and Mataloko sites.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya 28 Oct 2025 Kaishan signs steam supply agreement for 165-MW geothermal green ammonia facility in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area 27 Oct 2025 Gunung Lawu in Indonesia no longer identified as a Geothermal Working Area ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines 22 Oct 2025 EDC to decommission 30-year-old Upper Mahiao geothermal power plant in Leyte, Philippines ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia 21 Oct 2025 Geo Dipa and BNI sign green financing agreement for geothermal in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia 20 Oct 2025 Star Energy starts exploration drilling in Hamiding geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia 17 Oct 2025 Drilling starts for 80-MW expansion of Muara Laboh geothermal site, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation 16 Oct 2025 China and Iceland issue joint statement on geothermal and green transition cooperation ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated 16 Oct 2025 Service contract for Montelago geothermal power project in the Philippines terminated ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia 13 Oct 2025 Pertamina Geothermal to invest USD 24m on Kotamobagu geothermal project, Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative 10 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Gujarat, India receives government funding for solar integration initiative ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia 8 Oct 2025 Star Energy adds capacity through retrofit of Salak geothermal power plants in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia 3 Oct 2025 Beyond energy: Ulubelu as a model for inclusive geothermal management in Indonesia ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Considering that most geothermal power plants currently operate at temperatures between 100 to 250 \u00b0C, little is yet known about how a geothermal power plant should be designed for much higher temperatures.\nThe study examines the design parameters and efficiency of binary geothermal power plants using different working fluids under a production temperatures of 300 to 350 \u00b0C. The standard working fluids are considered in the study (isobutane, butane, isopentane, pentane, cyclopentane), and compared with water. A double-pressure cycle was used for the simulations, as it strikes a balance between higher utilization and lower costs and complexity.\nThe maximum utilization or exergetic efficiency was used as the primary metric in comparing the different scenarios.\nComparison of utilization indicates that hydrocarbons generally are better options for binary power plants at temperatures below 240 \u00b0C. However, water outperforms butane and pentane at temperatures above 300 \u00b0C. As production shifts to become more vapor-dominated, the advantage shifts over to water with only cyclopentane providing comparable utilization numbers.\nThe study presents different power plant design scenarios comparing water and cyclopentane. The conclusion is that the higher critical temperature of water allows for more design flexibility, such as more cycle stages thus resulting in higher utilization. It also had other advantages, such as needing fewer wells, a smaller heat exchanger, and a smaller condenser.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards 23 Oct 2025 Call for Experts \u2013 International Geothermal Commission for Standards ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![LATAM Geothermal Congress declares a path forward for the region\u2019s geothermal future 21 Oct 2025 LATAM Geothermal Congress declares a path forward for the region\u2019s geothermal future ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech 20 Oct 2025 Dig Energy \u2013 Making geothermal heating and cooling competitive with innovative drilling tech ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Energy highlights potential for lithium extraction from geothermal in T\u00fcrkiye 14 Oct 2025 HEZ Energy highlights potential for lithium extraction from geothermal in T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Arup 13 Oct 2025 Boosting investor confidence in geothermal through strategic expertise \u2013 Jordan Weddepohl, Aru ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress 10 Oct 2025 Budapest, Hungary selected to host the 2028 European Geothermal Congress ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![European Geothermal Congress 2025 opens in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland 8 Oct 2025 European Geothermal Congress 2025 opens in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![CHARGE Europe 2025 to Explore Energy Branding in Istanbul 8 Oct 2025 CHARGE Europe 2025 to Explore Energy Branding in Istanbul ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya 6 Oct 2025 Octavia Carbon: Direct Air Capture as an enabler of geothermal growth in Kenya ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The project will run for 48 months and will receive EUR 4.2 million in funding from the EU, with additional funding coming from the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation.\nGeoHEAT will transform geothermal exploration through two key strategic shifts:\n1. Minimising pre-drilling exploration costs while quantifying and communicating the risks; and\n2. Maximising learning rates of exploration drilling while reducing the costs of characterisation.\nAs a first step, the high costs and shortsighted prospection are tackled with passive surface-based imaging methods and uncertainty encompassing modelling alternatives. In parallel to reducing measurement bias, this approach engages a larger population and stakeholder group in search for optimal locations for geothermal exploitation.\nIn the following step, GeoHEAT illuminates the subsurface to an unprecedented extent through a novel georadar probe. The georadar imaging is complemented with drilling-induced microseismicity monitoring and digital rock physics models to create a high-resolution understanding of the reservoir.\nDevelopment of the borehole radar prototype that can function at high temperatures and pressures is a core aspect of the GeoHEAT project. This tool is designed to enhance the detection and mapping of geothermal reservoirs, providing information on the geology and structures at up to 100 meters away from the borehole. No such borehole radar tool currently exists.\nTo maximize its impact and expediate its success, GeoHEAT consists of a complementary consortium with European leaders in the scientific, industrial, and public domain. Members of the project consortium include:\n* Fraunhofer IEG\n* ETH Zurcih\n* University of Geneva\n* GuidelineGeo\n* University of Pisa\n* Mignan Risk Analysis\n* Seismix\n* ALT\n* RWTH Aachen\n* TU Delft\n* Bo-Ra-Tec\nThe GeoHEAT also proposes effective and inclusive tools for public engagement and two-way communication, as well as the introduction of advanced decision-making tools for policymakers based on probabilistic modelling and uncertainty quantification.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The Market Consultation documents have been posted on the\nThis Market Consultation has several objectives:\n* To inform the market of the intended tender for the expansion of the cooperation;\n* To gauge interest in this collaboration;\n* To gain insight into the possibilities and ambitions of market parties with regard to the specific requirements and objectives applicable to the tender.\nThe information obtained from this phase will be used to prepare the tender documents. The Market Consultation is without obligation for all the parties involved, and participation does not put market parties in a favoured or disfavored position when tendering.\n#### Details of the project\nThe project concerns the Mining Permit Geothermal Search Area Amsterdam-Amstelveen 1 that was assigned to the partners effective January 2023 and has a term of 4(+1) years. The aim of the partners is to develop geothermal sources for the further sustainability of the heating networks in the Amsterdam region.\nBased on the available subsurface data (seismic and well data) in combination with the heat demand, the initial focus of the feasibility study for this lies in the southeastern part of the permit area; the sub-area \u201cAmstelland\u201d. An initial rough plan has been drawn up for the \u201cAmstelland\u201d project with the objective of having the first geothermal source operational in 2030.\n![]( map of the Amsterdam-Amstellan 1 permit (source: Mercell)\nThe cooperation between the municipality of Amsterdam, Vattenfall and EBN initially concerns the feasibility phase.

Based on its design, the Konin geothermal heating plant will generate approximately 8100 GJ per year. The city is also considering putting up recreational facilities around the heating plant, located in Pociejewo.\n#### A huge but worthwhile investment\nThe construction of the heating plant, as well as the drilling of the Konin GT-3 injection well, was facilitated with funding from the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management (NFOSiGW). However, efforts to explore for geothermal in Konin had started much earlier, with drilling of the first well completed back in 2015. Even then, the geothermal potential in Konin had been ascertained, with the well tapping into temperatures of up to 90 \u00b0C.\nSlawomir Lorek, president of MPEC Konin, provided some details on how funding for the project was raised.\nOf the PLN 67 million total investment for the project, PLN 26 million in funding an another loan of PLN 18 million came from the NFOSiGW. The local government then contributed PLN 4 million. The rest of the money from MPEC Konin.\n\u201cIt is an expensive investment if we translate the total cost into the amount of installed capacity,\u201d remarked Lorek.\nHowever, Lorek also said that the heating company considered the value of geothermal as an energy source that is independent of geopolitics. MPEC Konin directly experienced the rise in biomass prices as one of the effects of the Russian occupation of Ukraine\nLorek also expressed optimism that the geothermal heating industry in Poland will continue to grow. With ten geothermal heating plants now built, the eleventh, in Turek, is already on its way. \u201cWe will close the year 2024 with 10 operational geothermal heating plants, but we would very much like to see another ten built within this decade,\u201d\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant 28 Oct 2025 Konin, Poland officially starts operations of geothermal heating plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain 27 Oct 2025 GeotherMOOC free online course provides training on the whole geothermal value chain ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany 24 Oct 2025 Praxisforum event recognizes exceptional geothermal projects and research in Germany ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania 24 Oct 2025 Green Tech starts work on geothermal-heated greenhouse complex in Romania ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye 23 Oct 2025 HEZ Enerji starts operations of 24-MW Morali geothermal power plant in Aydin, T\u00fcrkiye ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results 23 Oct 2025 First well for Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant in Germany drilled with positive results ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer 22 Oct 2025 Brzesko, Poland to reissue tender for geothermal drilling due to expensive initial offer ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating 22 Oct 2025 Lower Austria starts deep geothermal exploration campaign for district heating ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France 21 Oct 2025 Registration \u2013 Geothermal Innovation Days; 3-4 December 2025; Strasbourg, France ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures 21 Oct 2025 Orkuveitan to lead deep geothermal drilling project in Iceland targeting 400 \u00b0C temperatures ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 20 Oct 2025 Webinar \u2013 Commissioning activities in geothermal power plants, 24 October 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner 20 Oct 2025 Geothermal project in Bad Bevensen, Germany to be revived with new partner ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The OECS is entering its 2025-2035 Decade of Action for Sustainable Energy Development, with geothermal energy at the core of its long-term strategy.\nDr. Didacus Jules, Director General of the OECS, emphasized the importance of this partnership: \u201cWe [are] beyond exploration now. Dominica is well advanced in its efforts, and we have relied very heavily on your expertise to assist in that process.\u201d\nAs part of the initiative, the OECS is developing a Geothermal Direct Use Strategy to 2035, aimed at integrating geothermal energy into agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing. The strategy includes feasibility studies, regulatory frameworks, and a cross-sector working group to advance geothermal development.\nKey Areas of Collaboration will enhance technical expertise through a capacity-building gap analysis, support the OECS GEOBUILD Programme, which is conducting a six-month study on geothermal skills and training needs across the region, facilitate collaboration on a geothermal resource mapping exercise to guide future development, and provide technical assistance services to support geothermal power generation.\nAccording to Ambassador Te Puni, New Zealand is committed to delivering \u201cpractical outcomes for small island developing states,\u201d helping to strengthen the Caribbean\u2019s renewable energy sector.\nWith Dominica\u2019s first geothermal power plant set to launch in 2025, the agreement is timely. The country is poised to follow Guadeloupe, home to the long-operating Bouillante Geothermal Plant, in bringing geothermal electricity generation online.\nChamberlain Emmanuel, Head of the Environmental Sustainability Division at the OECS Commission, highlighted geothermal energy\u2019s role in the region\u2019s renewable energy transition:\n\u201cWe are looking at at least 30% renewable energy penetration across the OECS region, with a minimum of 20% per Member State by 2035. But then again, there will be a range of percentages across Member States. We do have the potential for countries with geothermal resources to exceed these targets and position us in an excellent way, and it\u2019s clear that geothermal is really the backbone behind that transformation.\u201d\nThe OECS GEOBUILD Programme, backed by the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Caribbean Development Bank, and the European Union Caribbean Investment Facility, is playing a central role in ensuring the long-term success of geothermal energy in the Eastern Caribbean.\nWith technical support from New Zealand\u2019s Aotearoa New Zealand-Caribbean Facility for Renewable Energy (FRENZ), this initiative will help the region overcome workforce challenges, build local expertise, and strengthen energy security.\nSource:\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n## Upcoming event\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n### Check out the latest Industry Events & Conferences\nGo to Events\nNews\n![LATAM Geothermal Congress declares a path forward for the region\u2019s geothermal future 21 Oct 2025 LATAM Geothermal Congress declares a path forward for the region\u2019s geothermal future ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![El Salvador legislation approves Geothermal Energy Law 11 Sep 2025 El Salvador legislation approves Geothermal Energy Law ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![New bill proposes private investment in El Salvador geothermal sector 4 Sep 2025 New bill proposes private investment in El Salvador geothermal sector ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![CDB announces financial close for Dominica geothermal power project 2 Sep 2025 CDB announces financial close for Dominica geothermal power project ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Registration open \u2013 LATAM Geothermal Congress, El Salvador, 22-25 September 2025 29 Aug 2025 Registration open \u2013 LATAM Geothermal Congress, El Salvador, 22-25 September 2025 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![St Kitts and Nevis receives five bids in geothermal production drilling tender 20 Aug 2025 St Kitts and Nevis receives five bids in geothermal production drilling tender ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Nicaragua revokes Momotombo geothermal concession over money laundering charges 15 Aug 2025 Nicaragua revokes Momotombo geothermal concession over money laundering charges ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![LaGeo celebrates 50 years of Ahuachapan geothermal power station in El Salvador 31 Jul 2025 LaGeo celebrates 50 years of Ahuachapan geothermal power station in El Salvador ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![OECS deliberates acquiring geothermal drill rig to be shared across Caribbean countries 22 Jul 2025 OECS deliberates acquiring geothermal drill rig to be shared across Caribbean countries ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Global Sustainable Islands Summit highlights the geothermal ambitions of Nevis 30 May 2025 Global Sustainable Islands Summit highlights the geothermal ambitions of Nevis ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Grenada plans geothermal exploration drilling by 2026 28 Apr 2025 Grenada plans geothermal exploration drilling by 2026 ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n![Dominica reports progress on construction of 10-MW geothermal power plant 23 Apr 2025 Dominica reports progress on construction of 10-MW geothermal power plant ](\nSHARE\n![]( ![]( ![]( ![](\n[]( [](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\n![](\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Heat planning can be used to identify areas that can later be supplied sustainably with heat networks fed by geothermal energy, for example,\u201d\nThe first step of the process will be to examine the current situation in each of the eight member municipalities. The potential for future heat supply within and across the municipalities will then be analyzed. Finally, various development options will be highlighted and an action plan will be developed that the municipalities can implement, both individually and together.\n\u201cThe fact that eight municipalities are taking the lead here is an important sign that the heat transition is being taken seriously in our region. Because we must act now and set the course for the future.

However, many geothermal reservoirs contain naturally occurring greenhouse gases (GHGs), including carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), which are released during power production. With increasing global pressure to decarbonize energy systems, geothermal operators are prioritizing emissions reduction to align with environmental, societal, and financial imperatives.\nA recent paper presented at the 2024 Geothermal Rising Conference (GRC)Ian Richardson of Contact Energy Simon Webbison of Ormat\nWhy reducing geothermal emissions matters\nThree key factors are driving the focus on reducing emissions from geothermal power plants:\n1. Carbon pricing regulations\n2. Public and societal pressure\n3. ESG and financial considerations\nTechnologies for emission reduction\nThe paper categorizes the primary technologies used for emissions reduction in geothermal power plants:\n* Non-Condensable gas (NCG) reinjectionPuna, HawaiiTe Huka, New ZealandCarbfix in Iceland\n* Pumped binary systemsMcGinness Hills and Steamboat, Nevada, USA\n* Gas purification and reuseKizildere in Turkey\nBenchmarking global efforts\nRichardson and Webbison\u2019s catalog provides a detailed overview of geothermal power plants actively reducing emissions.
