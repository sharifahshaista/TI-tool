But 26CO2 annually, or 7\nA February report lays out a blueprint for tackling each of these sources of CO2 and 2050\nThe report identifies several key levers that must all be pulled in order to deal with the climate problems from buildings: energy efficiency, electrification, flexible power use, and design that minimizes materials and uses cleaner ones. Each is showing varying degrees of progress around the world.\n\u201c\u201c\n!cartoon buildings with solar panels, heat pumps, smart energy systems, other electric equipment, powered by renewable energy (Energy Transitions Commission)\n## How to make buildings more energy efficient\nBuilding developers and owners can pursue a variety of strategies to make their buildings less energy-intensive and cheaper to operate without sacrificing the comfort of their residents, according to the report.\nThey can seal air leaks; insulate attics, walls, and floors; and install double- or triple-pane windows to make buildings snug like beer cozies. Weatherization strategies that take a medium level of effort would cut 103060\n!chart showing passive techniques, including air sealing and wall insulation, their energy savings, and rates of return. (Energy Transitions Commission)\nFor retrofits, online tools and in-person energy audits can help owners decide which changes make the biggest difference for the climate, their comfort, and their energy bills.\nOther simple techniques can combat growing demand for cooling, which globally is set to more than double by 20502540\nEfficiency measures \u201c\nBut because the payoffs can be slow to materialize, governments should provide targeted financing to lower-income households that might not otherwise be able to afford these upgrades, she added.\nThere\u2019s also the challenge of convincing landlords to invest in efficiency measures even though tenants often pay for utility bills themselves. To ensure broad uptake, the authors recommend policymakers implement building performance standards, an approach adopted by U.S. cities like New York and St. Louis to penalize building owners who fail to meet certain emissions or energy-use benchmarks.\nFor new builds, energy codes and other regulated standards can set a performance floor. They differ widely worldwide, but the Passive House approach is \u201c5070\nWhat\u2019s more, new buildings that use 20\u201c15\nConnecting buildings via underground thermal energy networks in which they share heat can also unlock big efficiency gains \u2014 and do it faster and at bigger scales than individual action might. The report notes that they \u201c\n## To decarbonize buildings, electrify everything\nBuildings will need to be fully electrified to become climate friendly. That means swapping fossil-fuel\u2013fired equipment for \u00fcber-efficient heat pumps (including the geothermal kind), heat-pump water heaters, heat-pump clothes dryers, and induction stoves.\nHeat pumps are essential to decarbonize heating, which is the biggest source of operational emissions and currently only 15two to three times as efficient as gas equipment, and they lower emissions even when powered by grids not yet 100.\n!chart of building energy use and fossil fuel use showing heating takes the biggest share of both Heating accounts for 45% of building energy use. Eighty percent of on-site fossil fuel use in buildings goes to heating. (Energy Transitions Commission)\nHeat pumps can come at a premium, though the authors expect prices to fall as sales grow and installers gain experience. In countries with mature markets, heat pumps can even be cheaper than gas heating systems, according to the report: Take Denmark, Japan, Poland, and Sweden.\n!ALT TEXT: chart of heat pump and gas boiler costs, based on the cheapest main model, in different countries (Energy Transitions Commission)\nFor most homes in the U.S. and many in Europe, per the report, heat pumps are cheaper to run than gas equipment and have lower total lifetime costs. Heat pumps make even more economic sense when consumers are considering installing an AC\nThese appliances also keep getting better. Manufacturers learn how to improve technologies with experience, as they have done with solar panels and wind turbines. The result is that heat pumps are becoming more efficient; getting smaller; and reaching higher temperatures as they transition to natural refrigerants (which also have lower global warming potentials), the authors write.\nBut policymakers need to address energy costs to encourage widespread electrification, according to the report. Countries with high electricity prices relative to those of gas\nFixes include shifting environmental levies that are currently disproportionately piled onto electricity bills to gas costs, offering lower electricity rates for customers with electric heating, and putting a price on carbon, the report says. Banning gas equipment would be the most direct move, but \u201c\n## Make demand for grid power flexible\nBuildings will need more power when they\u2019re all-electric, potentially straining grids. Unchecked, global electricity demand for buildings by 20502545\nThat\u2019s still massive. So, to decarbonize buildings without breaking the grid, we\u2019ll need to make them flexible in their electricity demand, the authors note. By using power when it\u2019s cheap, clean, and abundant, these edifices will also be more affordable than they\u2019d be otherwise.\nLow-cost smart thermostats and sensors can reduce demand by 1530tens of thousands of dollars in annual savings by dialing down energy use when grid demand is highest.\nThe report recommends that all buildings aim to have the ability to shift when they actively heat or cool by two to four hours without compromising comfort. That\u2019s doable with existing solutions that provide thermal inertia, including insulation and tank water heaters that can store hot water for when it\u2019s needed.\nUtilities and regulators can spur more flexible demand by implementing electricity rates or\n\u201c\u201c\n## How to clean up embodied carbon\nBuilding floor area globally is expected to grow by over 50205075CO2 between now and midcentury.\nBut that amount could be reduced to about 30CO2 by maximizing the utility of buildings that already exist, decarbonizing building materials, and designing new ones differently.\nUsing existing structures is \u201c\n!chart of opportunities to reduce embodied emissions, with building nothing having the biggest potential (Energy Transitions Commission)\nProducing materials drives up-front emissions, and the biggest contributors are cement, concrete, and steel, the report notes: They account for 95\nLow- and zero-carbon cement, concrete, and steel can be made using electricity, alternative fuels, exotic chemistries (including ones inspired by corals), and carbon capture with storage. But developers need incentives to buy these clean materials, which aren\u2019t yet widely available or competitive on cost alone.\nA complementary approach is to design buildings with less of the emitting stuff. For the same floor space, a mid-rise structure uses less material than a high-rise, which needs a larger foundation and bigger columns.

(peeterv via Getty Images)\nThe Trump administration appears poised to cancel billions of dollars of federal funding meant to help U.S. industries convert to cleaner alternatives to burning fossil fuels.\nStates can\u2019t match the federal government\u2019s spending power, but there are steps they can take to reduce industry\u2019s emissions, support jobs and economic growth in places burdened by industrial pollution, and help prepare U.S. companies for global markets increasingly demanding lower-carbon commodities and products.\nSo says a March report from think tank RMI25\nTo be clear, \u201cRMI\u201c\nBut some common lessons can be drawn, she said. The first is not to try and recreate the federal government\u2019s \u201c$6 under the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s Industrial Demonstrations Program, which is now potentially on the Trump administration\u2019s chopping block.\n\u201c\nThat\u2019s too bad, because many industrial companies rely on \u201c\u201clike steel and cement, which have massive capital assets like blast furnaces and cement kilns that will need to be replaced or significantly retrofitted to cut emissions.\nBut other strategies represent lower-hanging fruit \u2014 in particular, replacing fossil-fueled boilers with industrial heat pumps and electric boilers, said Jeffrey Rissman, industry program director at the think tank Energy Innovation.\nThese technologies are well-suited to electrifying steam heating for food and beverage processing, chemicals production, pulp and paper mills, and 30\nHeat pumps, especially, are far more efficient at converting energy into heat than fossil-fueled boilers, Rissman said. These technologies are already being deployed today and can save companies money compared to fossil-fueled systems in some applications.\n\u201c\n## Finding the money to decarbonize industry\nPutting some public money into the up-front costs of electrification could certainly help move things forward, Rissman said. And in some cases, states may still have access to federal dollars to make that happen.\nTake the\nThe largest of the\nIndustry is Pennsylvania\u2019s top-emitting sector, responsible for about 30\nAbout 60RMI\u201c\nThat includes smaller-scale federal funding sources, he added. For example, the Department of Energy\u2019s Industrial Training and Assessment Centers program provides grants of up to $300000\u201d\nA handful of states are looking at spending their own money to boost industrial decarbonization. One way to do that is to tap into state and regional programs that collect fees from polluting industries, such as California\u2019s greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative encompassing 11Washington state\u2019s cap-and-invest program, RMI\nIn California, lawmakers are considering the state\u2019s greenhouse gas reduction fund as a source of money for 90\n\u201c35000\u201c\nAnother funding avenue proposed by AB1280RMI\u201c\nThat could eventually include part of the $20been frozen by the Trump administration and is\n\u201c now in place in nine states, which require state agencies to purchase concrete, steel, and other industrial outputs that are made via lower-carbon processes and using lower-carbon inputs, can further incentivize industries to invest in decarbonization, Rissman said.\nThose programs can also provide reporting and compliance structures that companies will need to meet demands for lower-carbon products from corporate buyers, he said. And U.S. firms that export to Europe will be looking to avoid the looming\n## Adding the regulatory \u200b\u201c\u200b\u201c\nStates have regulatory \u201c\u201creplace fossil-fueled water heaters, boilers, and process heating with electric systems within the next decade, Cheng said.\nColorado has both carrots and sticks in place, Wil Mannes, senior program manager of industrial decarbonization initiatives for the Colorado Energy Office, said during January\u2019s webinar. The state passed a climate law in 2021 that set emissions limits on industrial facilities, with 20302015\u201c\n\u201cCalifornia, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, and New York are among the states that have launched these discussions to craft long-term plans for reducing customers\u2019 reliance on fossil gas delivered through utility pipelines.\nIn Illinois, state regulators and other stakeholders are considering \u201c\n## A key to decarbonization? Ensuring long-term benefits for companies\nRegulations and up-front financing are both important policy levers. But widespread industrial decarbonization won\u2019t take off unless companies are confident that the investments they\u2019re making will eventually pencil out financially.\n\u201c\u201c\nElectric industrial heating faces a core challenge in the U.S. \u2014 the between fossil gas and electricity. Cheap domestic gas supplies have undercut the economics of industrial electrification over the past two decades, and while\nUnderneath these broad averages lie significant regional differences, however. Low spark gaps have\nNarrowing the spark gap down to where it encourages industrial electrification relies on two important variables, Kwon said \u2014 \u201c\nOne way to do that is to \u201c\nThat\u2019s why industrial electrification proponents are eager for states to create routes for industrial customers to access these cheap wholesale prices, rather than remaining on the retail utility rates that shield customers from these price swings. Access to bulk electricity price differentials is particularly essential for making the business case for thermal-energy storage technologies, which convert electricity to heat and store it for long durations.\nIn return, big industrial customers can act similarly to utility-scale batteries on the grid, Kwon said \u2014 storing excess power when prices are low and using it to reduce their grid demands when power is scarce. That\u2019s already happening in Northern European countries \u201c\nJust how this concept can be applied depends on what kind of utility rates and energy market structures different states have, Rissman said. For decades, utilities have negotiated special rate structures with particularly large and power-hungry facilities, such as steel furnaces and aluminum smelters. And competitive energy markets like those in Texas, or across some Northeastern and Midwestern states, allow large customers to contract with retail energy providers in ways that let them access wholesale energy market prices, he said.\nBut these arrangements are largely kept private since they constitute a competitive advantage for the industries that are getting them, he noted. What\u2019s more, rate programs still need to protect factories or facilities from being exposed to the enormous price spikes that can occur at times of power shortage or grid emergency \u2014 at least, for all but the handful of industrial players willing to take the risks involved. At the same time, wholesale pricing structures shouldn\u2019t allow industrial customers to avoid paying their fair share of power grid investments or other costs that are bundled into retail rates.\nIn California, advocates have proposed regulations to allow industrial decarbonization projects to access low-cost renewable energy through some kind of exposure to or pass-through of the state\u2019s wholesale energy market, Cheng said.

Powin went on to deliver battery enclosures for many pathbreaking projects: It supplied the landmark utility-endorsed battery fleet in Arizona, and a truly mammoth system in Australia, to name just a few of Powin\u2019s self-reported KKR\nAnd then in June, Powin filed for bankruptcy, alerting the state of Oregon of mass layoffs at its Tualatin campus, outside Portland. The news jolted the storage industry, since so many major grid storage plants run on Powin\u2019s hardware and software. The bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing, but storage software specialist FlexGen has placed a bid to buy Powin\u2019s assets at auction in early August, offering Powin customers a way to keep their batteries running.\nCleantech bankruptcies have flourished under the second Trump presidency, and the storage sector is uniquely exposed. The industry runs almost entirely on imported battery cells from China, making it vulnerable to rapidly shifting trade policies. The Biden administration raised tariffs on Chinese batteries, and President Donald Trump cranked the overall rate on Chinese imports as high as 145new bureaucratic regime to regulate the amount of China-derived equipment in those storage plants.\n\u201c\u201c\nNonetheless, Powin\u2019s collapse stands out for the scale of the company\u2019s reach \u2014 and raises serious questions. Is Trumpian chaos enough to unseat a leading battery supplier, even as the market for grid batteries continues to surge?

Rondo\u2019s new project courts a controversial customer to prove it works at scale.\n![](\nBy Jeff St. John\n22 October 2025\n* *\n!Rondo Energy\u2019s 100 megawatt-hour thermal battery at the Holmes Western Oil Corp. facility in Kern County, California.\nRondo Energy\u2019s 100-megawatt-hour thermal battery at the Holmes Western Oil Corp. facility in Kern County, California. (Rondo Energy)\nThermal energy storage systems, which turn electricity into heat that can be tapped for hours or days at a time, could help decarbonize the production of everything from cement to beer.\nBut in the U.S., where the economics of replacing fossil fuels with electricity remain challenging, thermal-battery startup\nLast week, the San Francisco Bay Area-based firm 100\u201c\nThe installation is housed in what looks like a four-story prefabricated office building. Inside sits a massive stack of refractory bricks, which are heated to temperatures of more than 1000183220\nThe project is something of a Faustian bargain. It will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 13000\nRondo\u2019s argument for pursuing this application is twofold. For one, fossil fuels will be in use for decades to come, and so we might as well reduce emissions from the sector where we can. Second, thermal-storage startups need paying customers in order to scale up their technology, which could prove necessary to minimize pollution from a host of hard-to-decarbonize sectors.\n\u201c\u201c\nFinding cost-effective projects in the U.S. has become even more important after the Trump administration canceled hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants for industrial decarbonization efforts across the country. The defunded projects included ones that planned to use Rondo heat batteries: International spirits maker Diageo wanted to install the tech at its\nThose companies haven\u2019t said if they plan to continue work on those projects absent federal funding, and O\u2019Donnell declined to comment on their prospects. \u201c\nBut industry experts have pointed out that building first-of-a-kind thermal batteries is challenging without government funding to absorb some of the risk. The recent rollbacks jeopardize the U.S.\u2019s ability to develop a technology that could play a major role in cleaning up industrial heating, which is responsible for roughly\n\u201c\u201c\n## Building a first-of-a-kind project\nRondo\u2019s first 2\u201c\nRondo\u2019s Kern County battery, meanwhile, is its first major installation, though it has several others in the works across Europe. It\u2019s building similar heat batteries at a chemicals plant in Germany, a green industrial park in Denmark, and an undisclosed food-and-beverage processing facility in Spain or Portugal.\nThe market for Rondo\u2019s tech is stronger in Europe, where companies pay much higher prices for fossil gas and face sizeable fees and taxes on their greenhouse gas emissions, O\u2019Donnell said. In the U.S., by contrast, fossil gas is cheap, and only a handful of states impose costs on industrial carbon emissions.\nCalifornia is one of those states. Under its\nStill, even in more competitive markets like Europe and California, Rondo has additional work to do to hit its long-range cost goals. O\u2019Donnell said the company is targeting $30\nBut the Holmes Western project is \u201c\u201c\n## Soaking up excess clean power with heat batteries\nThe holy grail for thermal storage \u2014 the thing that will make it broadly cost-competitive with fossil-fueled heating \u2014 is tapping into cheap, clean power.\nThat\u2019s because the cost of electricity is ultimately what dictates whether a thermal battery makes financial sense. But unlike fossil fuels, electricity prices vary not just from week to week, but from hour to hour. That makes it tricky for would-be customers to evaluate whether to stick with a gas boiler or to make a bet on an electricity-powered system like Rondo\u2019s.\nSolar and wind, however, reliably generate power at a very low cost. In some parts of the U.S. and the world, the amount of renewable energy available exceeds electricity demand for hours at a time, driving wholesale power prices to zero or even negative.\nStoring this excess carbon-free electricity as heat can significantly cut costs for owners of thermal storage systems, O\u2019Donnell said. The challenge for providers of the tech is to get utilities, regulators, and energy-market operators to allow industrial customers to access those low or negative energy prices, O\u2019Donnell said. Today, most industrial sites buy their electricity from utilities at retail rates that don\u2019t pass through these wide wholesale fluctuations.\nThis is especially true in California, where thermal batteries are \u201c\nSolar power is close to overtaking fossil gas as the state\u2019s predominant source of electricity. Much of it is generated at times when there isn\u2019t enough demand for electricity to use it or enough battery capacity to save it for later, forcing the state\u2019s grid operator to curtail increasing magnitudes of solar.\nThermal batteries could soak up that cheap renewable energy while helping industries decarbonize, Cheng said. But \u201c\nHolmes Western Oil Corp. is in an unusual position of owning enough land surrounding its facility to build its own 20 solar array without connecting to the grid. That \u201c\nBut that\u2019s a rare occurrence. Most industrial customers will need to source power from the grid \u2014 and opportunities for them to access electricity at wholesale prices are few and far between.\nDoron Brenmiller, cofounder and chief business officer of Israel-based thermal energy storage provider Brenmiller Energy, said Europe is moving more quickly than the U.S. to support heat batteries, including a number of projects his company is building. He cited the European Commission\u2019s upcoming\n\u201c\u201cspecialty grid services like frequency regulation and demand response.\nBut getting the first large-scale projects up and running remains the most important next step for the industry, he said.

But that promises to be an expensive endeavor, and the gas system in Millville is practically new, with many years of useful life left. In an industry that\u2019s virtually always used fossil fuels to make heat, the company would be charting a new course in its effort to decarbonize.\nIt\u2019s a dilemma facing food and beverage manufacturers across the country. Giant conglomerates and artisanal shops alike are feeling the pressure from consumers, shareholders, and regulators to minimize their environmental footprint \u2014 from how they source ingredients to how they operate the bakeries, breweries, and factories that make our supermarket staples.\nBut they are also contending with the logistics and cost of overhauling their operations. As firms like Oatly take the first steps, their real-world experiences could help ease the qualms of more-reluctant manufacturers.\n\u201c\n\u201c\nMore than 1\n_(Credits, clockwise from top left: Overcrew, SV5_\nAcross the U.S. manufacturing sector, direct heat use contributes a major share of the country\u2019s planet-warming pollution, amounting to roughly 2018\nNearly\nProcesses like mustard-making and cheese pasteurization require relatively low temperatures.

The reality is that natural gas is cheap and abundant in the U.S., which makes it much harder to justify the expense of switching to electricity, especially for giant factories. And given that U.S. manufacturers have used fossil-fuel boilers for over a century to produce steam, many companies prefer to stick with technologies they already have and that are well understood \u2014 especially for things that people consume.\n\u201c\n\u201c\n![]( At Oatly's facility in Millville, New Jersey, oats undergo an enzyme and temperature treatment to create the liquid oat base.

Mostly, it has to do with ditching steam.\n\u201c\u201c\nThat history, coupled with low natural gas prices, has made steam the default setting for many facilities. But not every industrial process requires the high temperatures and pressures that steam-driven systems deliver. Often, facilities that need steam for specific purposes \u2014 like sterilizing infant formula or treating almonds to kill bacteria \u2014 will also use steam for more routine operations, such as washing food and cleaning.\nGas-fired boilers supply heat for Oatly\u2019s New Jersey facility. (Matt Peters for Canary Media)\nUntil recently, manufacturers didn\u2019t see this as much of a problem. But as companies look to decarbonize, using energy-intensive steam complicates those efforts.

Making the change would require redesigning the factory\u2019s systems, but it may be worth the effort. If facilities can use hot water, they could operate more efficiently and cost-effectively. And it\u2019d make it easier for plants to adopt currently available solutions such as electric boilers and industrial heat pumps.\nEdmonds stood up, grabbed a dry-erase marker, then sketched out the complex calculations his team is considering for a possible heat-pump installation in New Jersey.\nThere\u2019s the \u201c\u201c\n\u201c\n![]( Oatly's heat-recovery system captures and repurposes thermal energy from the production process. (Matt Peters for Canary Media)\nAs it happens, Oatly already uses electric heat pumps at its flagship facility in Landskrona, Sweden, and a factory in the Netherlands. The machines boost the heating potential of hot water used throughout the plants, reducing the use of fossil boilers. The company also is in the process of replacing an aging boiler in Landskrona with a hybrid model that can burn gas or biomass pellets. Still, it\u2019s hard to copy and paste those projects onto other facilities. In Europe, regional climate policies alongside rising gas prices \u2014 driven by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine \u2014 make for different market dynamics than in the United States.\nThen there\u2019s the fact that, save for the Landskrona plant, Oatly\u2019s other facilities are relatively new. \u201c\nThe same is true for many of its manufacturing partners. Next door to Oatly\u2019s Millville factory is a larger facility run by 2022\nAs Oatly weighs what to do with its gleaming new boilers, other food and beverage companies are figuring out how to revamp much older factories. Kraft Heinz, headquartered in both Chicago and Pittsburgh, is one of those manufacturers.\nWith roots tracing back to the late 1800\u201cESG88\nLast year, the Biden administration\u2019s DOE1709DOE59101015\n\u201c\u201c\nLike Oatly, the company is scrutinizing how it uses heat in the first place. Kraft Heinz has started testing different ingredients to see if it can cook various products at lower temperatures while maintaining their classic tastes. Adopting less heat-intensive processes will be key as the manufacturer looks to ease off its gas boilers and shift to using electricity at its massive factories, which make everything from cream cheese, candy, and ground coffee to hot dogs and frozen tater-tots.\nInside a Heinz ketchup production facility. (Kraft Heinz)\n\u201c800\u201c272023\nEventually, the manufacturer aims to replicate its efforts across not just its remaining factories in North America but also within the dozens of manufacturing sites it partners with outside the region. \u201c\nKraft Heinz and many other companies can\u2019t solve all of their energy problems through de-steaming alone. But novel technologies are becoming available that could clean up the trickier, higher-temperature processes inside of food and beverage plants.\nTo learn more about one potential solution, I sat down with Addison Stark, CEO\nThe Colorado-based startup is making a heat-pump boiler that\u2019s designed to slot in where a gas boiler would go in a factory\u2019s steam-distribution system.

Reforming electricity markets would enable thermal batteries such as Rondo\u2019s to earn money for the role they play in balancing the electricity grid.

(Rondo)\nIt\u2019s unlikely that any of these measures will be enacted under the second Trump administration, which spent its first week attempting to unravel many Biden-era climate and clean energy policies. But advocates see investing in U.S. food and beverage facilities as part of the country\u2019s broader goals of making American manufacturing more competitive in the global economy.

Industry insiders say the proposed Constitution pipeline would do little to get more gas to New England power plants and could raise costs for both generators and consumers.\n\u201c\u201c\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin breathed new life into that narrative in a Boston Globe op-ed 125\nIt\u2019s the latest in the EPA\u201cend the $7 program that funds solar projects for low-income households, eliminate the Energy Star label for energy-efficient appliances, and strip itself of authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe Constitution pipeline is not a new project. Federal regulators initially approved it in 201420162020\nThen, in May, the Trump administration lifted its stop-work order on a major offshore wind project under construction off Long Island\u2019s coast, claiming the move was\nIn his Boston Globe piece, Zeldin traces New England\u2019s soaring electricity prices \u2014 the highest of any region in the continental U.S. \u2014 back to an inadequate supply of natural gas to the area\u2019s power plants. The Constitution pipeline would transport more gas into New York, where it could be exported to its neighbors to the East. More gas would mean more reliable power generation and lower electricity prices, Zeldin contends.\nIt has the ring of a plausible argument. New England\u2019s power producers are heavily dependent on natural gas \u2014 552024ISO\n\u201c\nPiping more gas up from Pennsylvania\u2019s ample supplies could seem like an economically sensible way to bolster the grid in light of these facts. The reality is far more complicated, however, say advocates and experts.\nThe major problem is that the pipeline wouldn\u2019t actually bring much, if any, new gas into New England, Dolan said. The Constitution pipeline would terminate in Schoharie County, New York, where it would connect to pipes that already carry gas into New England. That existing infrastructure is the true bottleneck, he said.\nThe pipes into and around New England are \u201c\n\u201c\u201c\nFurthermore, multiple New England states are enacting plans to transition away from natural gas for home heating and appliances. In late 202320502025\nEven if new pipelines increased New England\u2019s gas supply, that influx of fuel would be unlikely to consistently lower prices in the long term, experts said. Despite the appealing logic that more supply leads to lower costs, natural gas prices are inherently volatile and susceptible to influence by global events. In 20222020645220430\n\u201c\u201c\nA better solution to both price and reliability worries, said advocates, would be to build a system that simply requires less gas.\nThat would mean relying on a diverse portfolio of options that includes solar, offshore wind, battery storage, energy efficiency, and demand-response programs. Such resources could be coordinated to create virtual power plants \u2014 a collection of geographically distributed resources that can work together to supply power to the grid and reduce demand. Not only do these networks emit less greenhouse gases than fossil-fueled plants, but their components can be built more quickly and cheaply, McDiarmid said.\nThis approach already had a chance to prove itself this summer, when solar and storage worked together to lower peak demand during a heat wave that saw temperatures hit 100\n\u201c\n* Fossil fuels\n* Policy & regulation\n* Northeast\nSarah Shemkus is a reporter at Canary Media who is based in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and covers New England.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\nUpvotesNewestOldest\nL\nLale Davidson\n0 points\n2 months ago\nThe Trump regime keeps issuing stop work orders on offshore wind projects that are nearly complete and would relieve our need for more gas.

    "content":"Redwood Materials says second-life batteries are the cheapest form of long-duration storage. If true, battery startups are in trouble \u2014 and renewables are in luck.\n![](\nBy Julian Spector\n6 August 2025\n* *\n!Aerial shot of array of boxes lined up in desert landscape\nRedwood Materials announced this summer that it is powering a data center outside Reno, Nevada, with a large solar array and used EV batteries, pictured above. (Courtesy of Redwood Materials)\nEnergy storage is having a moment \u2014 but the batteries that are taking off today only have enough juice to provide a few hours of grid power. Developers technically could stack up more batteries for longer-term storage, but that gets prohibitively expensive. For a renewables-dominated grid to ride out days of poor solar production or even just an entire night, a breakthrough in cost-effective, longer-term storage is needed.\nOver the last couple decades, venture capitalists have recognized this transformative possibility and heaped billions of dollars into the sector known as long-duration energy storage, or LDES\nA few weeks ago, I saw something in the desert outside Reno, Nevada, that got me thinking the investors and startups may have been barking up the wrong tree all along.\nFormer Tesla Chief Technology Officer JBunveiled a surprising new project in June at the Tahoe campus of his lithium-ion recycling company, Redwood Materials. Instead of ripping apart old electric vehicle battery packs, his engineers arranged them across a patch of desert and hooked them up to an adjacent solar field. This assemblage now stores so much clean power that it can run a small on-site data center, rain or shine, night or day.\nIn other words, instead of inventing a brand-new technology tailored for long-term storage, Redwood made it way cheaper to stack enough time-tested lithium-ion batteries to accomplish that goal.\nUnveiling this new business line, Straubel wasn\u2019t just diversifying his revenue streams. He was staking claim to the long-duration storage market writ large.\n\u201c\u201c\nAs he spoke, Straubel pointed at a bar graph depicting the costs of those types of LDES\nIt\u2019s a big claim. Second-life battery development is even newer than the LDESB2U and Element Energy, had built large-scale second-life storage plants, and those were just in the last few years. The sector has a lot of work to do to convince customers and financiers that the gently used battery packs can be trusted to hold up over years of service. And with new lithium-ion packs getting ever cheaper, the discount offered by used batteries may prove tenuous.\nStill, Straubel\u2019s first operating project, which holds 63\n## Starting off bigger and cheaper than LDES\nAt the June event, Straubel essentially asserted that his band of desert engineers, in just a few months of tinkering, has outmaneuvered the researchers and companies working on long-duration for decades.\nThat deserves some scrutiny \u2014 but even pinpointing the costs of the competition is challenging.\n\u201c\u201c\nRedwood says its second-life battery installations cost less than $15024482024\nIron-air is under development, most famously, by Straubel\u2019s former Tesla Energy compatriot Mateo Jaramillo at Form Energy, a VCraised more than $12 to date. Redwood calculated iron-air costs at higher than $150below $20 when its factory reaches full production scale.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that not all these technologies are directly comparable, because companies design and market them at different durations based on their technical sweet spots. If a technology works especially well at, say, 1248\n\u201cVC\u201c\nEpistemological issues aside, Redwood accurately diagnoses that the LDES\nBrand-new lithium-ion batteries aren\u2019t economically viable at longer durations, though their limits keep expanding as battery prices fall.\n\u201c\nPumped-hydro and compressed-air energy storage work for longer durations, but they are huge, billion-dollar infrastructure projects of the sort that don\u2019t get built anymore in the U.S. (Canadian company Hydrostor is attempting to break that curse with a $15500MW4000 in California; if it gets permits to build, it might be online by 2030\nFlow batteries-,Flow%20batteries,-Flow%20batteries%20operate) \u2014 which store energy in tanks of liquid electrolytes \u2014 have been kicking around for decades with some success in China, where they benefit from government favor. In the U.S., they\u2019ve not gained much traction.\nMeanwhile, many LDES\nTake ESS2011\u201cselling an Energy Warehouse with a bit over six hours duration, and only this year announced a \u201c10\nThe LDES\n## **LDES**\nThat\u2019s not to say the other LDES\n\u201c20LDESbattery startup Inlyte Energy. \u201cLDES\nThe sector has even been showing signs of life, at least compared to its dismal track record from the preceding decade. Form completed its factory in Weirton, West Virginia, and 100\nFlow batteries have built up considerable installed capacity in China, but that trend hasn\u2019t gotten much coverage in English-language press, said Eugene Beh, CEO\nItalian startup Energy Dome has moved swiftly from demo to commercial operations with an iconoclastic design: It stores energy by compressing carbon dioxide in a controlled environment; decompressing it turns a turbine and generates electricity. After building a pilot and a commercial project in Sardinia, Energy Dome just announced an\nThese more out-of-the-box LDES\nSecond-life companies take hundreds of batteries from different manufacturers, with different patterns of wear and tear, then operate them all in concert. If that was easy, more people would be doing it by now. Firms that get this wrong could start fires, and fire safety is one of the key arguments used against lithium-ion installations, both by rival technologists and the general public.\nThen again, Straubel has as much experience as anyone with the inner workings of lithium-ion batteries. At Tesla, he built the nation\u2019s leading electric-car company and a wildly successful stationary-storage business with the Powerwall and Megapack.\nThen there\u2019s the question of longevity. The batteries were pulled out of vehicles for a reason: usually due to their capacity degrading, though other problems develop with age, like higher internal resistance, which makes batteries heat up during discharge. If second-life packs need to be swapped out too frequently, it undercuts the ease and cheapness of the model.\nThat leaves the matter of supply. Success in second-life depends on a steady and cheap source of gently used EV1EV5\nThe available supply of used EV\u201c10\u201c2030\nIndeed, he added, the growth in volume of used EV\n## Lithium just keeps winning\nIt\u2019s too soon to know if used EV\nIn doing so, Redwood puts a new spin on an energy-storage maxim that venture capitalists keep forgetting, or simply ignoring: Lithium-ion always wins.\nChallengers that rely on different chemistries have to build up from negligible production scale and convince customers to take a chance on a design that few people have seen before. It\u2019s a clear uphill battle.\nLithium-ion batteries, in contrast, command an unmatched and ever-expanding scale of industrial production, mostly in China but increasingly in the U.S. too. That manufacturing juggernaut unlocks incremental gains from economies of scale and continual innovation. It also confers consumer confidence, because the technology has such a clear track record of performance.\n\u201c10LG2000CEO\nNonetheless, investors continued to bet that the streak would end, and they could own a piece of the transformational tech that would triumph for longer-term storage.\n\u201cLDES\u201c\nOver the last decade, lithium-ion has steadily chipped away at use cases where new battery inventions were supposed to win out. New lithium-ion is starting to push into six-hour configurations and beyond, said Stoikou, from BloombergNEF. Global average pricing for turnkey grid storage averaged $16520242024\nNow, the cost savings from reusing lithium-ion packs accelerate the chemistry\u2019s push into the long-duration market \u2014 something that would be a big win for grid-decarbonization efforts, while delivering the LDES\nClarifications were made on August 672025\n* Long-duration energy storage\n* Batteries\n* Energy storage\nJulian Spector is a senior reporter at Canary Media.

    "content":"New solar, wind, and batteries could be a huge help to grid reliability. Instead, Trump is propping up a false solution: old, unprofitable coal plants.\n![](\nBy Jeff St. John\n14 April 2025\n* *\n!A large coal plant with multiple smokestacks is viewed from afar during the day\nA coal-fired power plant in Georgia. (Sam Nash)\nThe Trump administration is threatening to force U.S. grid operators and utilities to keep money-losing coal-fired power plants running, no matter how dirty and expensive their power is.\nIts stated reason? To shore up the reliability of the U.S. power grid.\nIt\u2019s the latest salvo in a long-running battle over the country\u2019s increasingly brittle grid \u2014 one that pits those in favor of hanging on to fossil fuels, and particularly coal, against those who put their faith in a future powered by cleaner and cheaper alternatives.\nThat battle is entering a critical phase as the grid faces challenges on multiple fronts.\nEver more intense summer heat waves and winter cold snaps driven by climate change are already straining the grid. An unprecedented boom in electricity demand, spurred by AIaging and unprofitable coal power plants have been closing at a rapid clip \u2014 and grid backlogs are preventing new solar, wind, batteries, and even fossil-gas plants from being built fast enough to replace them.\nIf these imbalances persist, more than half of North America faces 102024build more fossil gas\u2013fired power plants and\nBut energy experts insist that there\u2019s no single, simple solution to this high-stakes challenge. Maintaining reliability will certainly require retaining some otherwise unprofitable fossil-fueled power plants. But it also requires pressing utilities and regional grid operators to rapidly bring solar, wind, and batteries online \u2014 and enlisting electricity users to shift power use to reduce costly peaks in demand.\nThis multifaceted approach would bolster the grid without sacrificing cost and climate concerns. Flocking back to coal and ratcheting up gas, meanwhile, would cost consumers more, increase climate and air pollution, and ultimately result in a less diversified and therefore more fragile grid than one balanced by renewables.\nIn the longer term, the U.S. must break barriers to building far more high-voltage power lines to connect clean energy across regions and share power when extreme weather strikes, experts say. It also needs to support the economics for \u201cadvanced nuclear and enhanced geothermal power, or long-duration energy storage systems that can fill the gaps when the sun isn\u2019t shining and the wind isn\u2019t blowing.\n\u201c\n\u201c\n## Why coal isn\u2019t going to save the grid\nBaldwin\u2019s \u201c\nLast week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order that authorizes the Department of Energy to prevent uneconomical coal plants from closing, even if they\u2019re violating federal and state carbon and environmental mandates and imposing higher power costs on customers. This would be the most aggressive federal intervention in modern history into the authority of states to regulate utilities, and of regional grid operators to manage competitive energy markets.\nMany Republicans in Congress have long insisted that grid reliability problems are primarily caused by climate and clean-energy policies put in place by states and the Biden administration. They argue that regulations, not economics, are forcing coal plants into \u201c\nDuring \u201c\nUnder questioning, most representatives of the U.S. grid operators, which are responsible for managing the systems that deliver electricity to about two-thirds of U.S. customers,\nBut Rep. Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat and ranking member on the energy subcommittee, pushed back on Republicans\u2019 framing. Instead of trying to keep coal plants open, he said, utilities, grid operators, and regulators must clear bottlenecks preventing new clean energy and energy storage from taking over the role that fossil fuels have previously played.\nGrid operators are \u201c\u201c\nInstead, Republicans are considering repealing the clean-energy tax credits created by the 2022\n\u201c\n## Getting the grid-reliability diagnosis right\nPallone\u2019s comments underscore two of the biggest problems facing the U.S. grid.\nThe first is that coal simply cannot compete economically against alternatives. Coal has dwindled to providing only about 15, as both fossil gas and renewables fall in cost. Last year, solar, wind, and batteries alone made up more than 90 of the 56lead new additions in 2025, too.\nThe second problem is that many U.S. utilities and grid operators have been unable to move fast enough to embrace the advantages of cheap, clean energy. As Energy Innovation\u2019s February report highlights, \u201c\nMuch of the reluctance from certain grid operators stems from the fact that solar and wind ebb and flow with the weather, whereas fossil-fueled power plants can be turned on and off on command.\n\u201cCEOPJM65\nBut daytime solar production and nighttime wind generation can still provide a large and predictable amount of the power needed during hot summer afternoons and evenings and cold winter mornings, when demand for electricity spikes and reliability issues loom, said Wilson Ricks, a researcher and energy-modeling expert at Princeton University\u2019s ZERO.\nMeanwhile, lithium-ion batteries are becoming a more cost-effective way to store clean power for use when the grid needs it, he said. Utility-scale batteries deployed in California and Texas are storing gigawatts of solar power to cover peak grid demands during sunset and evening hours, for example.\nTaken together, \u201c\nReal-world experience bears this out, said Ric O\u2019Connell, founding executive director of GridLab, a think tank that contributed to the Energy Innovation reliability report. The standout example is Texas, which is adding wind, solar, and batteries faster than any other state.\nThe transmission grid operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas \u201c85helped cover the absence of fossil-fueled plants that were shut down for seasonal maintenance, he noted.\nSimilarly, Southwest Power Pool, which manages a grid stretching from the Dakotas to Oklahoma,\nLast year, on California\u2019s solar- and battery-rich grid, grid operator CAISO100with 100 for at least a part of each day. Gigawatts of battery capacity also improved the state\u2019s summer grid reliability by shifting solar power into the evenings.\nThat\u2019s a big change from the summers of 20202022CAISOCEO\n\u201c\u201c\nBy contrast, O\u2019Connell said, PJM\u201cPJM\u2018\u2018\n## Crying wolf on \u200b\u201c\nPJM\nThe region expects to lose about 40202030inability to interconnect new resources to replace what it\u2019s losing.\nFor years, PJM conducted by other grid operators. It has also failed until recently to undertake the kind of regional grid expansion plans that have been done by grid operators in Texas, California, and the Midwest, which have enabled them to bring much more clean energy online.\nCritics say PJMPJM\nInstead, state regulators and grid operators have been forced to use costly emergency mechanisms to keep power plants from closing. In Maryland, for example, PJMused its \u201c to pay the owners of coal- and oil-fired power plants to postpone their retirements until at least 2028\nThe high price tag of these emergency stay-open measures highlights the economic burden of poor planning around power plant retirements, O\u2019Connell said.\nThose costs are bound to rise if the Trump administration forces coal power plants to stay open under emergency orders \u2014 or even demands that\nThese poor economics are why backers of renewables are frustrated with those who insist that clean-energy policies are to blame for coal plants closing and thus for grid reliability challenges.\n\u201c\nKaren Palmer, a senior fellow and director of the electric power program at think tank Resources for the Future, agreed that coal retirements are \u201c\nNor are\nAnd major wintertime grid emergencies of the past several years, such as the Texas grid collapse in February 20212022\nNo one technology is immune to weather stresses and disruptions. Subzero temperatures can freeze up wind turbines and sap battery capacity, and scorching temperatures reduce solar-panel output and dampen battery performance. But this reinforces the importance of a portfolio approach to solving reliability challenges, Baldwin said.\n## No simple fix for a looming grid crisis\nNone of this is to downplay the complexity that grid operators face \u2014 particularly at a time when demand for electricity is growing at a pace not seen in decades.\nThe Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which manages a grid serving 15\nIn New York, state grid operator \u201c2034which lag behind state targets.

    "content":"Utility Southern Co. will install Inlyte\u2019s iron-salt long-duration battery, tech the startup has updated for the era of renewables and data center demand.\n![](\nBy Julian Spector\n7 May 2025\n* *\n!Battery-testing equipment lined up inside a facility\nBattery cyclers charge and discharge Inlyte\u2019s iron-sodium batteries to test their efficiency and durability. (Inlyte Energy)\nAntonio Baclig spent eight years as a researcher at Stanford University scouring as many battery designs as he could find in search of something cheap enough to transform the grid. He honed in on one from the 19802021\n\u201c\nNow Inlyte has secured its first major utility contract, a crucial step in proving the viability of the technology.\nSouthern Co., which owns the biggest utilities in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi, has agreed to install an 8015\nNew types of batteries are notoriously difficult to bring from the lab to large-scale production. Many startups have toiled at this task for years, pitching anyone who will listen about the superiority of their technology. None have come close to unseating the dominant lithium-ion battery designs that have plummeted in cost over the last decade as China massively scaled up production. But researchers have concluded that lithium-ion batteries can never get cheap enough for the mass deployments of storage that will be needed to run a grid dominated by renewable energy.\nThe onus is on Inlyte, then, to avoid the lackluster fate of its peers and prove its exceptionality among the ragtag camp of lithium-ion alternatives. The company has three important things going for it: dirt-cheap cost of materials, a simpler-than-usual manufacturing process, and system-level round-trip efficiency on par with lithium-ion battery systems. (Round-trip efficiency is a metric for how much of the electricity stored in a battery can later be recovered. The technologies challenging lithium-ion tend to fare poorly on this front.) Plus, the work of researchers in prior decades has already helped speed Inlyte\u2019s path to market.\n## New riff on a forgotten battery\nSome battery-startup founders have spent years toiling away in a lab on a favored chemistry, only to spend more years figuring out how to turn it into a viable product. Baclig, a materials scientist, surveyed the annals of battery science and plucked something off the proverbial shelf that had almost hit the big time but not quite.\nHe landed upon the family of sodium metal halide batteries, first developed in the late 19701987\nThe sodium-nickel-chloride chemistry became known in battery industry lore as the ZEBRA1990\nBaclig contends that the historical abandonment of iron-salt chemistries did not reflect an intrinsic failing in the technology, just a different set of needs at the time. Today, with record solar panel installations reshaping electricity systems around the globe, there\u2019s growing interest in cheap, long-term energy storage. And power plants don\u2019t need to cram as much energy into a confined space as electric vehicles do.\n\u201c\nBaclig reached out to the company that had pioneered the technology in the first place: Beta Research. That firm was looking for a new project to focus on as the Covid pandemic receded, Baclig said; after a year of conversations, he and Beta Research decided to join forces in 202282023\nSince then, the team has worked at a steady clip to dial in the best iron cathode for the grid storage job. They also scaled up the size of each cell, which, unlike in lithium-ion batteries, takes the form of a ceramic tube that gets filled with powdered iron and salt. The new tubes hold 20\nFrom there, Inlyte set about testing its new battery cells, culminating in a recent third-party engineering test of a 100\u201c\n!A person in protective gear opens a kiln filled with tubes.\nA technician uses a kiln to prepare the ceramic tubes that house the iron and salt powders to form an Inlyte battery cell. (Inlyte Energy)\nThe chance to innovate on a legacy design attracted the firm\u2019s chief commercial officer, Ben Kaun, who spent many years analyzing alternative grid storage concepts for the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit research arm of the U.S. utility industry.\n\u201c\u201c\n## Battery field test first, then domestic factory\nSouthern Co. will install and operate the first large-scale Inlyte battery system for at least a year as part of its ongoing efforts to test emergent long-duration storage technologies in a real-world environment.\nThe utility company was attracted to Inlyte\u2019s low fire risk (it does not use flammable electrolytes like conventional lithium-ion batteries) and its ability to be sourced domestically, Southern Co. R&\n\u201c\nThe company\u2019s subsidiary Georgia Power previously signed a landmark deal to test out another iron-based long-duration battery, from Form Energy, starting in 2026\nResearchers from the Electric Power Research Institute, Kaun\u2019s former employer, will document the results of the Inlyte installation and share them with utilities around the country.\n\u201c\nOf course, habitually risk-averse utilities often prefer to test-drive new technologies in their own backyard, even if that duplicates efforts elsewhere. Many utilities continued to tiptoe into lithium-ion battery installations even after the batteries had been operating for years on a massive scale in other parts of the country.\nBaclig, for his part, hinted at many more trial runs in the works for next year. These projects will be doable because Inlyte gained possession of a pilot-scale factory in the U.K. as part of the Beta Research acquisition. That facility can pump out megawatt-hour-sized volumes for early test projects, but it won\u2019t keep up if Inlyte starts closing commercial deals.\nBaclig has begun seeking a location for a factory in the U.S. Building a first-of-a-kind factory can be risky, but he stressed that four factories have been set up around the world for essentially the same technology, and the Beta Research team advised on all of them. The plan is to build at the same scale as those previous facilities, to minimize uncertainty around factory economics.\n\u201c\u2018\u201c\u2018\nFilling ceramic tubes with metal powders doesn\u2019t require the same pinpoint precision as a lithium-ion battery factory. When companies construct lithium-ion factories in the U.S., they have tended to cost at least $1\nFurthermore, the machinery to manufacture this unique battery does not come from China\u2019s dominant battery sector, a boon at a time when the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs are driving up prices on Chinese imports (even the equipment needed to build factories in America).\nGoing forward, Inlyte will need to move from field demonstration to customer contracts, and the company is focused on buyers who need power every day but also have occasional long-term backup requirements.\nInlyte is pursuing utilities like Southern Co., which must deliver power to a fast-growing region while surviving hurricanes and other extreme weather. The startup also has a dedicated pitch for providing data centers with backup energy: The long-lasting iron-sodium batteries can ostensibly replace both the instant response from uninterruptible power supply systems and the diesel generators that would kick in until power is restored. And the batteries could run every day to lower a data center\u2019s demand from the grid.\nConvincing data center owners to adopt Inlyte\u2019s product will not be trivial, but that sector is struggling to find the power capacity to fuel its growth, not to mention maintain corporate commitments to sourcing clean electricity. If Inlyte can really deliver clean, long-lasting power that\u2019s cheaper than fossil-fueled alternatives, it would almost certainly find willing takers with the ability to pay.\n* Batteries\n* Energy storage\n* Long-duration energy storage\n* Southeast\nJulian Spector is a senior reporter at Canary Media.

    "content":"New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin told Canary Media Trump\u2019s anti-wind order is \u201c17\n![](\nBy Clare Fieseler\n6 May 2025\n* *\n![](\nPresident Donald Trump holds up an executive order after signing it during an inauguration parade on Jan. 20, 2025. (Anna Moneymaker\/Getty Images)\nNew Jersey\u2019s Attorney General Matthew Platkin \u201c\nIn an exclusive interview with Canary Media, Platkin said the motivation for challenging the anti-wind directive \u201c\u201c\nTensions have been high between many of the states that are all in on wind energy and President Donald Trump since his first day in office, when he pressed pause on new wind development with an executive order. The order halted the approval of leases, permits, and loans for wind energy, pending a federal review. The move dealt a particularly strong blow to the country\u2019s still-emerging offshore wind efforts \u2014 and to Northeastern states like New Jersey that have based decarbonization goals and grid planning around the construction of offshore wind farms.\nAt the time of Trump\u2019s executive order, the nine commercial-scale offshore wind projects that already had federal permits in hand appeared safe from the pause. But Trump\u2019s anti-wind directive has since been cited in federal actions to derail two of those fully permitted projects, including New Jersey\u2019s only fully permitted project.\nIn March, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency clawed back a clean-air permit from New Jersey\u2019s Atlantic Shores wind farm, using the January executive order as its main justification. A month later, the Interior Department cited Trump\u2019s directive in a stop-work order issued to New York\u2019s Empire Wind 1, a massive 810just started at-sea construction.\nThe attorneys general are asking a federal court in Massachusetts to declare the president\u2019s directive illegal, in part because the administration provided no \u201c10\nJoining New Jersey in the filing are Democrat-led states Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington. The District of Columbia also joined.\nBarbara Kates-Garnick, a professor of the practice at Tufts University\u2019s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, said the coalition\u2019s coastal states could be influential in the outcome of the lawsuit. Massachusetts and New Jersey, she noted, are small states without much pipeline infrastructure to rely on to expand energy sources like fossil gas. Nor do they have much land to build utility-scale solar. But they have significant offshore wind resources \u2014 and they\u2019ve already spent years investing in and planning to develop those assets.\n\u201c\nThis lawsuit is the state of New Jersey\u2019s strongest rebuke yet against the U.S. government\u2019s obstruction of its ability to follow its own clean energy laws and goals.\nIn 2022112040\u201c183\nPlatkin spoke with Canary Media Monday about how the lawsuit came to be and the rationale behind it.\nThis discussion has been edited for clarity and brevity.\nCanary Media: What is the origin story for this multistate lawsuit?\nMatthew Platkin:20242025\nHe\u2019s now illegally trying to shut down the wind industry at a time when the president is saying we want to increase domestic energy production. And we\u2019re trying to ensure that we can address climate change. Also, we\u2019re dealing with rising costs. It just makes no sense \u2014 on top of it being illegal.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s EPA\nWe\u2019re looking at everything they are doing. Based on the number of lawsuits that our office has successfully filed, they\u2019re violating the law at a very unprecedented pace. And they\u2019re harming people here. So when it comes to wind, it\u2019s not a policy question in my job. It\u2019s a question of whether the law is being violated. And one of the things that they\u2019ve done with this wind order, and as you heard in other instances as well, is yanking permits unlawfully, both unconstitutionally and in violation of statute.\nIt was notable to me that, in the EPA\nThis administration seems to think that executive orders carry the force of law outside of some underlying legal authority. For example, an executive order can implement a statute or a constitutional authority. It cannot create new powers. But they seem to be confused about that, given the number of times they\u2019ve tried to rely on executive orders to do unlawful things.\nWhen the federal government issued Empire Wind a stop-work order, was that a tipping point for this group of attorneys general?\nIt\u2019s hard for me to say what the tipping point is for all of us. I think certainly the executive order was a major point. For us to have a basis for challenging, you have to have standing. We try to bring a suit when they are ready to be brought, when they are ripe for challenge.\nWhat is important for the public to know, when it comes to this lawsuit, about why it was brought by New Jersey specifically?\nThis is a time when we\u2019re dealing with rising costs, when everyone agrees we should be increasing domestic energy production. To just unlawfully shut down an entire industry, simply because you don\u2019t like it for political purposes or because you want to serve the interests of Big Oil, it just makes no sense. It\u2019s flagrantly illegal, but it also just makes no sense.\n* Wind\n* Offshore wind\n* Policy & regulation\n* Northeast\nClare Fieseler , PhD, is a reporter at Canary Media covering offshore wind.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\n## read next\n* ![ ](\nGeothermal\n### California can\u2019t get out of its own way on geothermal\n* ![Profile shot of a woman speaking into a microphone ](\nUtilities\n### Why utility regulators need to do more than call \u2018balls and strikes\u2019\n* ![ ](\nSponsored\n### The case for optimism in America\u2019s energy transition\n* ![Aerial shot of large warehouse surrounded by other buildings ](\nBatteries\n### In a first, a data center is using a big battery to get online faster\n![](",

(Lars Hagberg\/AFP via Getty Images)\nOn March 6\nAt a time of year when Canadian hydropower typically supplies up to a tenth of New England\u2019s power, the region has instead gone almost a month with virtually no cross-border flow of electrons.\nHydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec leaders say low prices in the New England market \u2014 not politics \u2014 are behind the decision to suspend sales. The disruption hasn\u2019t affected power costs or reliability in the region yet, but some experts say it could if the cutoff extends into the summer cooling season. The situation also highlights a potential risk to state clean energy plans that count on Canadian hydropower to help offset fossil fuels.\n\u201c\nHydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s main transmission line into New England, known as the Phase II1200MW510\nThe longer that New England needs to replace the absent hydropower, the more often it will call on natural gas or oil power plants to fill the gap with dirtier and more expensive electricity, particularly as demand increases in the summer and again next winter.\n\u201c\u201c\n## The future of Canadian energy in New England\nIn an email from a company spokesperson, Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec attributed its lack of exports to market conditions, saying milder spring weather has lowered demand and thus prices. Others have theorized the move is also a show of power\nHydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec has been sending signals for a while that it might be moving away from delivering power to New England at its historic levels. Last year, 5560II2022ISO2024\nThis pullback is likely due, at least in part, to ongoing abnormally dry and drought conditions in much of Quebec, which mean less water flow to power the company\u2019s generators. Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, therefore, faces choices about what to do with the power it can generate, whether that means holding out for higher prices on the New England market or selling it domestically to meet the province\u2019s own growing demand as it too electrifies in pursuit of climate goals.\n\u201c2024\nThe lack of exports from Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec coupled with the specter of fluctuating tariffs and counter-tariffs brings into focus the need for the New England grid to develop more stateside power resources and expand the infrastructure required to get energy where it\u2019s needed, experts said.\n\u201c\u201c\nSome are also concerned that ISO2000MW\u201c\nThe situation has also raised questions about the 1451200MW202026\nRecent circumstances, however, have those in the industry combing over the contracts to determine how solid Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s commitment to deliver that power actually is and how tariffs might affect the terms of the deal. One promising sign, they said: The company is still sending electricity into the U.S. over a second, smaller transmission line that ends in Vermont, which has an agreement to buy power from Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec until 2038\n\u201c\u201c\nIn the meantime, the region will just have to wait and see what Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec does next, without much information to go on.\n\u201c\u201c\n* Hydropower\n* Clean energy\n* Northeast\nSarah Shemkus is a reporter at Canary Media who is based in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and covers New England.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\nUpvotesNewestOldest\nR\nRobert Wan\n0 points\n7 months ago\nIs there any chance of New England accessing power from the Churchill Falls Hydroelectric Project in Atlantic Canada?\nG\nGreg Bailey\n0 points\n7 months ago\nIt should be possible.

These are all good things to see at a time when demand for new power production is soaring \u2014 thanks to electrification, industrial growth, and an AIsteadily rising electricity rates.\nOf course, these trends could prove short-lived, because the Trump administration is actively working to obstruct the buildout of clean and cheap energy.\nThis summer\u2019s signature Republican domestic policy law targeted wind and solar with early termination of their tax credits, effectively raising the cost to deploy these types of power plants. The executive branch has sought to halt or inhibit offshore wind and renewable development on public lands. Simultaneously, the Trump administration is giving an artificial boost to fossil-fuel plants. The Department of Energy is invoking emergency powers to block the planned shutdown of the J.H.

Can new policies ease costs without hurting reliability and climate goals?\n![](\nBy Jeff St. John\n12 March 2025\n* *\n![](\nThe moon rises near Pacific Gas & Electric's Oakland K substation in the hills of Oakland, California. (Jane Tyska\/MediaNews Group\/The Mercury News via Getty Images)\nEveryone agrees that California\u2019s major utilities are charging too much for electricity. But as in previous years, state lawmakers, regulators, and consumer advocates are at odds over what to do about it.\nWith the state\u2019s three biggest utilities reporting record profits even as customers\u2019 rates have skyrocketed, critics say the time is right to pass laws that will force regulators to more tightly control key utility costs \u2014 or even outright curb utility spending and profits.\nCustomers of Pacific Gas &&4720192023\nRates are set to climb even further in the coming years as utilities look to expand their power grids to meet growing demand from data centers, electric vehicle charging depots, and millions of households buying EVs and heat pumps. Utilities also need to build high-voltage transmission lines to connect far-off clean energy resources to population centers. And they need to harden and protect thousands of miles of low-voltage power lines to prevent deadly wildfires in a landscape that\u2019s growing more susceptible to conflagration because of climate change.\nUtilities are allowed to earn a profit on these infrastructure investments and to pass the costs onto customers \u2014 but only within reason. It\u2019s the job of regulators to ensure that profits aren\u2019t disproportionate to what utilities charge ratepayers.\nConsumer advocates are now demanding that the California Public Utilities Commission be more aggressive in challenging PG&SCESDG&CPUC\n\u201cTURN\u201c\nTURNCPUC\u201c\nBeyond TURNPG&20192018\nLegislation that would order the CPUCreform proposals faltered in the face of heavy lobbying from utility workers unions and pushback from utilities, which spend generously on state political campaigns.\nBut with customers of California\u2019s three big utilities now paying the\n## Why critics say the CPUC\nLast month, the California state Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee held a CPUC\nThat \u201c\nAll of these proposals would require legislative action, and some CPUC\u201c\nState Sen.

When it comes to generation, utilities can\u2019t back out of contracts for expensive power, even if they were signed more than a decade ago. Nor can they avoid buying power on the state\u2019s energy markets during times when those prices spike.\nTackling grid costs puts regulators and lawmakers in a bind as well. Nobody wants utilities to skimp on critical investments like replacing aging equipment or protecting power lines from being knocked down by trees or high winds. Efforts to police utility grid investments risk forcing regulators and utilities to spend lots of time and effort delving into the minutiae of those plans without any clear promise of savings to show at the end of it.\nEven so, Toney highlighted several bills being proposed this year, and others he hopes will be revived from last year\u2019s session, that could drive down some of these costs.\nOn wildfire-related expenditures, he\u2019d like to see a new bill that revives the policies proposed by CPUC\nAnother option to address utility spending is AB745regulatory gap between federal and state authority over certain types of smaller grid projects has led to utility overspending on those projects.

Those options can include securitization \u2014 having a utility issue bonds backed by the steady stream of payments its customers make on their bills \u2014 or the state issuing bonds to pay for certain utility costs.

This will work if people can plug in, charge quickly, and then move their cars. How do you make that easy? How do you motivate people (e.g. with extra fees for staying too long) without leaving people with unreasonable penalties if they forget to move the car or can't move it due to some unplanned issue? How do users who get home after all slots are full know when there is an open slot? I would not relish walking to the parking lot every 15 minutes every night of my life.\nI wonder if it would work to have many connection points, even if they can't all be powered simultaneously. With the right controls a resident could plug in at 6 PM, perhaps not get charged immediately, but know that before they leave the next morning their car will get its turn to be charged. If the cables to each car are cheap relative to the power infrastructure this could work economically, though maybe best in new construction.\nJust thinking...\nP\nPatrick McVay\n0 points\n6 months ago\nThanks for this article!

They didn't stop with investment incentives; they made it a mandate with non-compliance penalties. And the biggest parking lots have to comply within 3 years. Carrots aren't sufficient to make property owners & managers care about their tenants' utility bills. France brought the sticks. Bottom line: There isn't a faster way to develop widely distributed community solar micro grids delivering cheap reliable energy to everyone, with no new utility transmission, site acquisition or other site improvement spending required at large apartments & condos, BigBox & neighborhood shopping centers, business parks, & various public facilities like hospitals & schools.\nA\nArt Feierman\n0 points\n6 months ago\nFrance's plans are interesting, but it certainly seems like making it mandatory is going to boost overhead which will translate into higher rents. Unless of course everything is rent price controlled, which has its own pitfalls.\nIt seems the rate of EV sales in France is now between 22-25% of all new registrations, but, that still means the vast majority of cars in France run on fossil fuels. A quick search came up with 2024 numbers saying France has 1 million EVs registered out of 38.9 million cars. or less than 3%... Of course the bill requires this to happen within 5 years, so with 25% of new registrations being EVs, in 5 years that number should be 5% of all cars on the road. Might work out well, might prove an expensive boondoggle. Reality likely somewhere in between. Good luck France!\n![](\nAllan Jayne\n0 points\n6 months ago\nLandlords might not want to be subject to:\n1. Theft of power losses, including credit card fraud\n2. Demand charges, surcharge on electric bill if total usage by the building exceeds a certain amount in a given hour.\n3. Miscellaneous liabilities from existence of charging station in the complex. Would the investment community or the power companies be interested in establishing concessions in apartment complexes to provide car charging, setting uncontrolled prices, collecting payments, and caring for the infrastructure? The landlord just provides the space for the concessions.\nA\nArt Feierman\n0 points\n6 months ago\nWell, if this company is contracting directly with the tenants, and owns the chargers, then the owners shouldn't have problem (as their contract may not make them liable for any expenses,, assuming there's a practical way to implement chargers (especially where there are shortages of parking spaces, ie most multi-unit rental properties.\nA\nArt Feierman\n0 points\n6 months ago\nVery informative! In thinking on this piece, it seems like there are a number of hurdles. Many multi-family buildings lack assigned parking spaces, which would make billing a problem, or need to set up a limited number specific charging spaces would see a rotation of users, but how to bill? In such case, it would be like a gas station. Put in your credit\/debit card to charge up? Also having some EV specific spaces, could be a huge problem in buildings already short of spaces, which is likely the majority of buildings.\nMost likely success exists if this and other companies target condos (and co-ops), rather than rented apartment buildings. At this point in time the majority of renters, are likely unable to afford an EV at US prices. And the percent of renters, with EVs, let's say, in a 50 unit building would have to be at least 10%, maybe a lot more, to make it even financially practical, I would think? Of course targeting condo owners, isn't exactly helping spread the use of EVs to folks at the lower end of the middle class financially, most often, renters.\nOf course now, in 2025, something just north of 7% of vehicles on the US roads are EVs. And, I expect that almost all of those owners\/leasers of EVs, are home\/condo owners, not renters, due to the high entry price of EVs. Sure some folks with money prefer to rent, but that's the exception rather than the rule. And I suspect renting among higher income folks is mostly a big city thing, where many\/most people don't need cars.\nStill, this company seems to have a viable model, if, as they say, they will be selective with which buildings they work with. That said, good luck to them, in attempting to operate in renter only multi-family buildings, especially those with 50 units or less, as they may only have 1 renter with an EV, maybe 2? Could only having a handful of EVs in a building make this practical?\n## read next\n* ![ ](\nGeothermal\n### California can\u2019t get out of its own way on geothermal\n* ![Profile shot of a woman speaking into a microphone ](\nUtilities\n### Why utility regulators need to do more than call \u2018balls and strikes\u2019\n* ![ ](\nSponsored\n### The case for optimism in America\u2019s energy transition\n* ![Aerial shot of large warehouse surrounded by other buildings ](\nBatteries\n### In a first, a data center is using a big battery to get online faster\n![](",

(Gregory Rec\/Portland Press Herald via Getty Images)\nA legislative proposal in Maine that would impose new fees on community solar projects is having a chilling effect on solar developers, some of whom say they may stop working in the state, or even already have.\n\u201c\u201c\nThe\nNationally, net metering programs have been contentious, with states like California, New Hampshire, and North Carolina making big changes to mixed \u2014 and sometimes litigious \u2014 receptions. Maine\u2019s system has been under scrutiny for years, as many critics say it has created excessive profits for developers while unfairly shifting costs to consumers who don\u2019t even use solar power.\nWhile many renewable energy advocates and developers agree that the program needs some reform, they say the current bill goes too far. The legislation outlines a new system for compensating commercial and industrial customers who own solar panels. Currently, the compensation rate is based on standard utility electricity rates, meaning solar owners make more revenue when power prices rise. The bill would require a new mechanism of gradual, annual rate increases to avoid excessive windfalls for solar owners when energy costs go up.\nOf particular concern, however, are other provisions that apply to community solar developments, larger-scale installations that sell power to multiple rs.\nIn 20192021791008MW\n\u201c\u201c\nThe bipartisan legislation now under consideration would impose a monthly fee, paid by community solar owners to utilities. The money would be intended to cover the cost of delivering the solar power to consumers. Those \u201c\nProjects between 1MW3MW28056002 project, for example. Larger arrays between 3MW5MW6240004 installation. These rates would be increased as needed to keep up with the cost of maintaining and expanding the grid. The goal, proponents say, is to continue supporting solar in a way that does not add to residents\u2019 financial hardships.\n\u201c\nHowever, renewable energy advocates and solar developers say the monthly fees could scare away new projects as well as put existing operations at risk.\n\u201cCEO\nOpponents question the way these fees came to be included in the bill. They were not in the original draft legislation, but the idea was raised and voted on during committee debate. The language is in the process of being officially added to the bill so that lawmakers can report it out of committee and send it to the House floor. It is concerning that the fees received no public hearing, and many stakeholders and lawmakers are not even aware they are being added in, said Eliza Donoghue, executive director of the industry group Maine Renewable Energy Association.\nEven if this bill fails to pass, the damage may already be done: Investors in all sorts of clean energy segments are becoming wary of doing business in a state that would even consider retroactively changing the rules for projects that were designed and financed under a different set of expectations, opponents said.\n\u201c\nOpponents also worry that the bill sends the inaccurate message that increasing solar adoption makes energy more expensive, when research suggests the reverse is true. In 202420247\nWarren, however, says reining in even this modest increase could help some of her constituents.\n\u201c\u201c\nBill proponents are also not convinced by claims that the new rules would cause financial problems for developers. The provisions are designed to have less financial impact on smaller companies that are less able to take the hit, said Maine Public Advocate Heather Sanborn, a supporter of the bill.\nThe bill also contains important consumer protections that opponents aren\u2019t talking about, Sanborn said. Community solar operators would be required to rightsize customers\u2019 subscriptions, preventing them from paying for more credits than they can use. Should a customer still end up with more credits than they need, the operator would be required to issue a refund. The legislation would also encourage the installation of battery storage in conjunction with solar.\n\u201c\nFor opponents, however, the community solar fees are an intractable problem that outweighs any other provisions.\n\u201c\u201c\n* Solar\n* Policy & regulation\n* Northeast\n* Maine\nSarah Shemkus is a reporter at Canary Media who is based in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and covers New England.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\nUpvotesNewestOldest\nJ\nJohn Borger\n1 point\n5 months ago\nGerry Runte - I have similar questions. My Massachusetts town owns its own \"municipal lighting plant\". Its fully loaded, total retail rate is 17.7 cents per kWh - which is about what you cite for worst case net PROFIT under the new terms for these Maine solar projects! Plus, our net metering policy gives me as a residential solar owner only the light plant's average wholesale cost per kWh, nowhere near the retail rate. It sounds like Maine extended an incredibly sweet deal to attract solar projects but now has buyer's remorse and wants to renege. We'll see if it passes and what the investor fallout will be. That said,, as a 77 year old who skimped for many years to be financially secure in my old age, backing off implied commitments to investors so that boomers on reverse mortgages can save $7.00 a month on electricity seems driven not so much by compassion but by the simple fact that they have a propensity to vote. Understandable, but that does not seem like a perspective that will bring prosperity to Maine and ignores the fact that it's young people who are going to ultimately pay the price climate change will exact.

Time to stop the gravy train for developers and get CMP back to it's core function of just delivering electricity. Solar is intermittent and extremely costly with a major waste problem to manufacture and dispose of at end of service and gobbles up land. Those black panels are too hot to touch on a sunny day and radiate that heat into the environment.\nT\nThomas Moore\n0 points\n4 months ago\nWhere does this info come from? It doesn't make sense that CMP is subsidizing anyone.\nG\nGerry Runte\n0 points\n5 months ago\nWhile every project's financials differ, we know, with accuracy that a 5 MW kwh credit project can bill customers based on the then prevailing retail rate. If they offer a 15% discount, and sell their RECs, in 2026, their gross revenue will be about 23.5 cents\/kwh. After the charge from this bill is applied, and assuming they are 7% underd, that leaves about 17 cents\/kwh - 19 cents for projects less than 3 MW which have a lower charge, and 23.5 cents for those less than 1 MW. No question the bill represents a haircut for projects greater than 1 MW - but are these projects really unable to find a way to survive on this amount of revenue?\nT\nThomas Moore\n0 points\n4 months ago\nThe article suggest that the bone of contention is a fee that CMP should collect for \"distribution\". Since CMP already has a mechanism for collecting distribution costs for any energy source, directly from customers, why would it not also do that for community solar sources? I really don't see why the government should get involved in a matter that is between the solar sources and the consumers buying their kWh. And why is the word \"subsidy\" being bandied about here, when we are talking about consuming rate payers? Admittedly, I'm new to this situation, though I've been on Community Solar since 2017, first in MD, now in ME.\nD\nDavid P. Littell\n0 points\n4 months ago\nRep. Runte, respectfully, the answer is these projects see their return almost entirely down to zero and also violate their loan covenants and need to renegotiate loan terms with their lenders. The lenders will not take a loss and will require more equity to cover the loans where upon these Maine projects become negative or near negative equity return solar projects. No person or company would invest in such an arrangement. I have been involved as an expert on net metering projects in other states as you may know in front of other PUCs. This is an astonishingly poor bill and should be abandoned. If you must, please change the rules prospectively, not retroactively for those who have already put money into projects, steel in the ground in fair and reasonable reliance on the law and rules Maine established in 2019 through 2021.\n## read next\n* ![Gray metal boxes lined up with a blue sky overhead ](\nBatteries\n### California has a new law to prevent big grid battery fires\n* ![Aerial shot of a large warehouse complex next to homes ](\nVirtual power plants\n### Can crowdsourcing help solve the data-center power crunch?\n* ![A large ship with cargo at a port ](\nMarine transport\n### Global rules to decarbonize ships delayed amid Trump\u2019s pushback\n* ![ ](\nPolitics\n### The DOE\u2019s loan office enters its \u2018energy dominance\u2019 era\n![](",

That lack of fuel cost, along with lower operations and maintenance costs, make wind and solar a long-run winner financially.\nEnergy developers and utilities are following the money.

(DG Matrix)\nFor decades, electrical engineers have dreamed of a device that can seamlessly connect solar panels, battery systems, and on-site generators to high-powered equipment like EV\nNow, these devices, called solid-state transformers, are actually starting to hit the market \u2014 and they couldn\u2019t be coming at a more opportune time.\nThat\u2019s because the technology could be key to dealing with the torrent of power demand from data centers, factories, and electric-vehicle charging hubs that threatens to overwhelm the grid and cause utilities to burn more planet-warming fossil fuels.\nRight now, these large electricity customers are clamoring for more power than the U.S. grid can easily supply. In theory, this problem could be solved by allowing them to install their own solar arrays, batteries, and generators on site \u2014 ideally as a microgrid \u2014 but that seemingly simple solution is actually complicated and costly to execute.\nEvery solar array, battery, fuel cell, generator, or other source of on-site power requires multiple pieces of equipment \u2014 electrical protection gear, isolation transformers, step-up and step-down transformers, power converters \u2014 to safely turn direct current into alternating current or vice versa, and to raise or lower voltages to match the needs of different loads within a building.\nSolid-state transformers can do all that from a single device, controlling electricity as nimbly as routers control the flow of data.

President Donald Trump had also just been sworn in for the first time, reinvigorating climate skepticism and renewable energy resistance on the national stage.\nDespite the federal challenges, FEJA2021went even further on phasing out fossil fuels.

(Rolf Schulten\/ullstein bild via Getty Images)\nWhen utility Duke Energy backed North Carolina legislation four years ago to spur new investments in natural gas and nuclear power, opposition from pulp and paper mills, furniture factories, and other large industrial customers helped tip the political scales and reshape the measure into what ultimately became a landmark bipartisan climate law.\nToday, some of the same companies are changing their tune: deriding solar and wind investments, embracing coal and gas, and backing a bill that would unravel the 2021\nTestifying before the Senate Agriculture, Energy, and Environment Committee in March, three major industrial associations spoke positively about 2030702005\nThe bill would also allow the utility to recover power plant development costs from ratepayers before the facilities are producing electricity \u2014 a break from the status quo that would encourage Duke to build conventional nuclear plants, which have high upfront costs and long construction timelines.\nKevin Martin, head of the manufacturing and industry trade group Carolina Utility Customers Association, told Canary Media his organization is \u201cSB2612021\nOther stakeholders who testified displayed less support for the clean energy transition.\n\u201c2030\u201c\nVick said her group is \u201c\u201c2021\u201c\u201c24\n## How the economics of clean energy won over North Carolina\u2019s industrial customers\nAlthough the Trump administration has made a sharp U-turn on Biden-era policies meant to spur clean energy, little about the economics of renewables has changed since the start of the decade.\nAs of 2024\nSuch realities, alongside booming power demand, have prompted major industries in North Carolina to welcome renewables alongside more traditional electricity sources.\nDuke Energy\u2019s monopoly has also influenced industries\u2019 approach to energy policy. Because they can\u2019t purchase power anywhere else, large customers have relied on regulators to control prices. Big power users have also sought green tariffs \u2014 allowing them to buy renewable energy at a premium with Duke acting as a go-between \u2014 to help them meet their own sustainability goals.\nThose dynamics led major industry groups to join forces with clean energy advocates in 2021 to fight an early draft of a bill that prescribed massive new investments in gas plants and would have charged customers for the utility\u2019s forays into new nuclear power.\nDozens of mills and factories 2021\u201c\u201c\n\u201c\u201c\nBy the fall, the bipartisan version of the bill that was signed into law allowed Duke to seek multiyear rate increases, prompting some of the industrial groups to oppose it and others to remain neutral.

There were SMRs built in the U.S. in the 1950s-early 70s. they didn't pan out economically, so the industry upped the size to get an economy of size advantage. These newer SMR designs would get a dis-economy of scale, costing more than the 2 large Vogtle reactors, recently completed. Vogtle will be about 30-33\u00a2\/kWh delivered, and these would probably be 40-50\u00a2\/kWh delivered. The industry has touted their economy of scale, but never mentions the economy of size. The economy of scale would not kick in if ever, until many units were built. The U.S. and French nuclear industries never experienced a learning curve, but instead kept going up in cost in real dollars.

A commercial kitchen would help incubate food businesses and supply healthy meals during disasters. And an on-site community garden would provide food and educational opportunities.\n\u201c\u201c\nAround the corner from the future resilience center, on the town\u2019s main commercial strip, sits a boarded-up, three-bedroom home.

Halifax County had placed a temporary pause on new solar farms in October after pushback from some residents. As the expiration date for the moratorium neared, officials were weighing a new ordinance that would require a mile between each new project.\nThe result would be an economic \u201c\n\u201c\nThe one-mile limitation would also harm private landowners who rely on lease income from solar developers, several speakers at the hearing said.\n\u201c\u201c\nIn the end, county commissioners voted four to one to reject the one-mile buffer and allow the moratorium to expire.\n!A sign reading \"Town Square\" at the entrance to a space between two brick buildings.

The state has had less success, however, in helping lower-income households realize the benefits of these measures.

On Cape Cod, households making less than one-third of the area median income spent an average of 272023\nThe Cape and Vineyard Electrification Offering was conceived of as a way to overcome the sometimes unmanageable up-front cost of efficiency and clean energy upgrades, and to amplify the impact of individual technologies by deploying them together. Solar panels would keep down the cost of operating heat pumps, and batteries would maximize the amount of zero-cost electricity available to each home.\n\u201c\u201c\nThe pilot was designed and offered by the Cape Light Compact, a unique regional organization that negotiates electric supply prices and administers energy-efficiency programming for the 21201820202021gave it the go-ahead in 2023\nThe version that was finally approved called for 100\n\u201c\u201c\nUltimately, 55457003000033000\nThese figures raised some questions at a recent meeting of the compact\u2019s governing board, at which the Guidehouse report was presented. Downey acknowledged the cost, but pointed out that the need to transition off fossil fuels is inevitable \u2014 and comes with a price tag.\n\u201c\nThe report offers suggestions for improving any future iterations of the initiative. Pilot participants were prohibited from enrolling their solar systems in the state\u2019s net-metering offering, and therefore their compensation for excess energy sent back into the grid was between 51025\nThe Cape Light Compact will present the results at the August meeting of the state Energy-Efficiency Advisory Council, the group responsible for writing Massachusetts\u2019 triennial energy-efficiency plan.

Gavin Newsom (D) vetoed AB527\u201c\nOf more than half a dozen industry executives and analysts that Canary Media spoke to, however, none believed that argument.\n\u201c\u201c\nWhile Roland said it\u2019s difficult to determine exactly which groups may have persuaded the governor to block the legislation, \u201c\n\u201c\nIzzy Gardon, a spokesperson for Newsom, declined to comment. \u201c\n## California dreamin\u2019\nCalifornia\u2019s unique geology has made it the destination for the geothermal industry for decades. The Western Hemisphere\u2019s first commercial geothermal power station opened in California in 1960\nThe state has enormous untapped potential \u2014 and a growing need for electricity. California has shut down all but one of its nuclear power plants over the past few decades. In recent years, persistent drought has made the state\u2019s hydroelectric stations less dependable. Solar generation has soared, and a growing fleet of batteries has helped steady the supply when sun-soaked days threaten to overwhelm the grid with electrons and dark nights send panels\u2019 production plummeting. But the state\nBurning biomass, such as dry wood cleared from California\u2019s forests to help prevent wildfires, could provide one option \u2014 but that still generates carbon dioxide, and the demand for wood might encourage logging of healthy trees. Despite the state\u2019s reversal of its plan to shut down Diablo Canyon, its final atomic station, building new nuclear reactors is still banned in California. Hydropower is dogged by water scarcity. That makes geothermal a particularly attractive choice.\nIt\u2019s not without some drawbacks. Conventional geothermal, which involves drilling down into underground reservoirs warmed by volcanic heat, is limited to easily accessible areas and comes with the challenge of maintaining the subterranean water source over time. Next-generation geothermal companies are rapidly advancing drilling techniques that the oil and gas industry perfected in recent years to go deeper and harvest heat from dry, hot rocks, vastly expanding the locations with potential to generate energy. In a seismically active state, that carries some risk since the version of next-generation geothermal that uses hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, technology to drill could trigger earthquakes.\nBut every energy source comes with challenges, and neighboring states such as Utah, Nevada, and New Mexico are aggressively pursuing next-generation geothermal projects.\nIn theory, the best place to develop those first-of-a-kind plants would be California, with its energy-affordability woes and status as a major global economy.\n\u201c\u201c\nFor the most part, however, developers are steering clear of the Golden State. Companies such as Fervo Energy, XGS\u201c\n\u201cCEQA\u201c\nThe regulatory hurdles represent \u201c\n\u201c\n\u201c\u201c\nIn response to emailed questions, Fervo said it maintains leases near the Salton Sea region, an area with vast geothermal potential. But those parcels aren\u2019t currently under development since the state\u2019s permitting regime makes investing in drilling too risky.\n\u201cAB527\n## A revolution for geothermal?\nNot everyone is so bearish. Ormat, the nation\u2019s \u201c\n\u201c\u201c\nWhile Fervo lamented that a small number of green groups fought the bill, the company said the fact that there were \u201c\nFor XGS\u201c\n\u201cXGS\u201c\nThe company backed the bill and said categorical exemptions from CEQA\n\u201c\nThe key, she said, is time. Geothermal will grow in California no matter what \u2014 of that, Darago said, she\u2019s certain. The question is whether that happens in time to stave off blackouts and slash emissions on the trajectory the state has set for its electrical system.\n\u201c\u201c\n* Geothermal\n* Clean energy\n* Politics\n* West\n* California\nAlexander C.

Solar and batteries have been and will continue to be the favored resources because of their lower costs and multiple options for siting. Proposed offshore wind development is facing headwinds that may take a few years to overcome.

Trump has kneecapped every renewable resource development except geothermal.

The grid needs more energy just about everywhere in the U.S., but large-scale infrastructure construction runs into persistent delays and challenges. Adding generation and storage capacity in homes is relatively quick, and with the right incentives, can add up to a substantial tool to meet the grid\u2019s needs.\nIf Haven successfully implements those incentives, it thinks it will be able to install 10\n## Haven\u2019s home-battery strategy\nHaven launched in 2023CEO\n\u201c\u201c\nAt the same time, utilities have begun grappling with a sudden uptick in electricity demand to supply AI, industry, and electrification. Utilities increasingly recognize the value of fleets of aggregated batteries to help meet peak demand, Campo said, but they\u2019re much more comfortable contracting for large assets than thousands of small ones.\nPutting these threads together, Campo decided Haven should own the batteries it installs at customer homes, so it can control them to serve utilities\u2019 grid needs, and pull together different revenue streams to lower the cost for consumers.\n\u201c\u201c\nNow Haven can tap into a new tranche of state funds to make this a reality.\n## California earmarks $280\nBatteries don\u2019t generate power, but for arcane bureaucratic reasons California has long funded its desired battery expansion with the Self-Generation Incentive Program.

(Courtesy of Duke Energy)\nLast summer, utility Duke Energy joined U.S. and state officials to announce with fanfare\nFunded jointly by the federal government and Duke, the project highlighted how advanced technology can help solve the problems posed by an aging electric grid: It will include cables better able to withstand extreme weather and modern support structures that can accommodate new sources of power.\n\u201c\nBut advocates and experts say the Lee-Milburnie transmission line in Eastern North Carolina is just the tip of the iceberg. To save consumers money and meet growing energy demand, they believe policymakers should follow other states\u2019 lead and encourage Duke to perform many more grid upgrades like the one unveiled last summer.\nBipartisan legislation that would do just that failed to meet a key deadline last week, but its contents could still end up in another bill before the session ends later this year. Backers of the measure remain hopeful, in part because it would benefit all energy sources, not just renewable ones.\n\u201c\u201c\n## A congested electricity highway\nIn North Carolina, as across the country, the transmission grid \u2014 the network of high-voltage lines designed to transport electrons across long distances \u2014 faces a confluence of challenges. For one thing, the grid is old: about 7035\nThese aging conductors have much less capacity than newer ones, said North Carolina-based Maureen Quinlan, senior officer for energy modernization at The Pew Charitable Trusts. Old lines are also susceptible to failure from normal wear and tear as well as from extreme weather events like hurricanes and heat waves, causing \u201c\n\u201c\u201c\nThe resulting grid congestion from existing, interconnected power suppliers is one \u201c1152023\nA second challenge for the present is the long line of projects waiting to merge onto the clogged highway that is the transmission grid. In North Carolina and throughout the Southeast, that \u201c\nAs Duke and other utilities race to build power plants of all kinds to supply large data centers, manufacturing plants, electric vehicles, and more, the queue is poised to lengthen until the road is widened \u2014 that is, until the grid\u2019s capacity is expanded.\n\u201c\u201c\nAddressing today\u2019s bottlenecks helps utilities save money to address a hurdle for tomorrow: building brand new highways to bring large sources of energy, such as offshore wind, to population centers, such as the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area known as The Triangle.\nThat\u2019s why experts are increasingly looking to advanced transmission technologies, which can quickly be added to the existing grid to allow it to carry more power.\n\u201c\u201c\nThe technologies include both hardware and software. Carbon composite conductors, for instance, are up to twice as efficient as traditional aluminum cables reinforced with steel, in part because they sag less when overheated. These modern lines are a key reason the Lee-Milburnie upgrade is expected to reduce the length of service interruptions by 10\nThrough a process called dynamic line rating, utilities can place sensors on lines to assess temperature, wind speed, and other factors, allowing significantly more power to flow under favorable conditions.\nInstalling advanced hardware is more economical than building new conventional transmission lines because it offers more bang for the buck, doesn\u2019t involve new rights-of-way, and reuses some existing infrastructure. One recent study found that replacing conventional lines with advanced conductors nationwide would \u201c852035\nThe Lee-Milburnie line, for instance, will allow 1600260\nAdvanced software technologies are also money-savers.

While federal officials gave companies involved in the West Coast hubs a warning before announcing the cuts last week, three separate producers involved in the other five hubs had not heard from the administration as of Thursday, according to California Hydrogen Business Council CEO\nBut already, the potential cuts are sowing doubt within the emerging sector \u2014 and in the clean energy space more broadly.\n\u201c\u201c\n## **\u201c**\nIt remains unclear whether the document outlining a fuller list of cuts, which a lobbyist\nIn a statement, the Energy Department said it was \u201c\u201c\nA former Energy Department official with direct knowledge confirmed that the list is legitimate and said that it represents the grants DOE\n\u201c\u201c\nAlready, key Republican lawmakers have expressed concern.\n\u201c\u201c\nThe uncertainty only adds to the challenges facing the hydrogen industry.\nThe Biden administration created a two-pronged hydrogen strategy via the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act.

Shifting money from those larger-scale alternatives not only pulls money from customers without solar to those with solar, they argue, but represents a lost opportunity for utilities to invest in more cost-effective clean power.\nSeverin Borenstein, head of the Energy Institute at the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, is a key proponent of the cost-shift theory. In January, \u201c\nBorenstein said that a proper analysis finds that in 2024485CPUC\nIn February, McCann published a 20\nThat uncertainty has led both sides to accuse the other of using intentionally misleading data and methods. McCann acknowledged that his initial analysis last year miscalculated the benefits that he believes rooftop solar has delivered to customers of the state\u2019s three big utilities. He originally calculated $23202415\nThe in-the-weeds exchange between McCann and Borenstein reveals a deeper disagreement at the heart of their vastly different estimates \u2014 one that cost-shift foes say California regulators have failed to fully acknowledge. It centers on a simple question: When a household generates solar power at the same time as it\u2019s using electricity from the grid, who owns that solar?\nAccording to McCann, who cited legal precedents and the fundamental physics that determine the flow of electrons, solar power that customers generate and consume at their own homes and buildings is theirs by right. They paid for the solar systems, and they\u2019re directly using the electricity those systems generate.\nBut according to both Borenstein and the Public Advocates Office\u2019s analysis, solar power simultaneously generated at the time that power is being consumed on site should be considered as a cost to other utility customers.\nAs Borenstein states in his January rebuttal, \u201c\u2018\nIn other words, according to this logic, allowing solar-equipped customers to count the power they generate as offsetting their use of grid power undermines the fundamental structure of utility rates, which recover the costs of electricity delivery by charging customers for their hour-by-hour energy use.\nThese two different interpretations go a long way in explaining the chasm between McCann\u2019s analysis and those from Borenstein and the Public Advocates Office. According to McCann\u2019s analysis, this category of \u201c485\nBut McCann believes that Borenstein and the Public Advocates Office\u2019s perspective runs afoul of standing legal and regulatory precedent on such matters.\nHe cited a 2015CPUCUC\nFERC\nThe bigger problem with the cost-shift numbers from CPUCCPUC20002002\nInstead, the Public Advocates Office published a\n\u201cCPUC\nThen, the CPUC\u201c\n## Differentiating rooftop solar\u2019s past from its future\nIt\u2019s important to note that these cost-shift analyses are looking at California\u2019s rooftop solar past, not its future. In more recent years, as solar has grown to make up an increasing portion of California\u2019s electricity-generation mix, peak grid demands have shifted from late afternoons when the sun is still shining to hot evenings after the sun goes down. Every new increment of solar power added to the grid is less and less useful on its own in reducing these\nBatteries that store power for use during these post-sundown peaks have thus become a vital addition to new solar installations, both at the utility scale and at homes and businesses.\nThe net-billing tariff the CPUC2022rewards customers who add batteries that can store and inject power during those valuable hours \u2014 a service that should reduce how much energy utilities need to secure and how much grid infrastructure they need to build to serve those peak moments.\nBut solar advocates are now worried that the CPUC\u201c\nUnder the CPUC20CPUC\nThe CPUC\u201c\nThe CPUC\u201c\nThe CPUC\nBut even supporters of those concepts like Toney don\u2019t see much hope of lawmakers fielding bills that would ask taxpayers to shoulder costs now borne by utilities. \u201c\u201c\nGiven the unlikely prospects of using taxpayer funds to pay rooftop solar customers, solar advocates fear that the CPUC\nCook of the Environmental Working Group described the potential ramifications of such a move: \u201c20\n* Solar\n* Distributed energy resources\n* Policy & regulation\n* West\n* California\nJeff St. John is chief reporter and policy specialist at Canary Media.

Utilities, regulators, and policymakers are scrambling to keep pace. If they mismanage their response, it could lead to higher utility bills for customers and far more carbon emissions. But this mad dash for power could also push the U.S. toward a cleaner and cheaper grid \u2014 if tech giants and other data center developers decide to treat the looming power crunch as a clean-power opportunity.\nUtilities from Virginia to Texas are planning to build large numbers of new fossil-gas-fired power plants and to extend the life of coal plants. To justify this, they point to staggering \u2014 but dubious \u2014 forecasts of how much electricity data centers will gobble up in the coming years, mostly to power the AI\nMost of the tech giants in question have set ambitious clean energy goals. They\u2019ve also built and procured more clean power than any other corporations in the country, and they\u2019re active investors in or partners of startups working on next-generation carbon-free energy sources like advanced geothermal.\nBut some climate activists and energy analysts believe that given the current frenzy to build AI\nIt\u2019s time, these critics say, for everyone involved \u2014 tech giants, utilities, regulators, and policymakers \u2014 to \u201c\n\u201cAI\nWilliams isn\u2019t alone. Climate activists, energy analysts, and policymakers in states with fast-growing data center markets fear that data center developers are prioritizing expediency over solving cost and climate challenges.\n\u201c\u201c\nSome tech firms intend to rely on unproven technologies like small modular nuclear reactors to build emissions-free data centers, an approach that analysts say is needlessly unreliable. Others want to divert electricity from existing nuclear plants \u2014 as Amazon hopes to do in Pennsylvania \u2014 which simply shifts clean power from utility grids to tech companies. Yet others are simply embracing new gas construction as the best path forward for now, albeit with promises to use cleaner energy down the road, as\nMeanwhile, several fossil fuel companies are hoping to convince tech firms and data center developers to largely avoid the power grid by building fossil-gas-fired plants that\nBut a number of tech firms and independent data center developers are pursuing more realistic strategies that are both affordable and clean in order to meet their climate goals.\nThese projects should be the model, clean power advocates say, if we want to ensure the predicted AI-fueled boom in energy demand doesn\u2019t hurt utility customers or climate goals.\nAnd ideally, the companies involved would go even further, Williams said, by engaging in utility proceedings to demand a clean energy transition, by bringing their own grid-friendly \u201c\n## Getting utilities and data centers on the same page\nThe basic mandate of utilities is to provide reliable and affordable energy to all customers. Many utilities also have mandates \u2014 issued by either their own executives or state policymakers \u2014 to build clean energy and cut carbon emissions.\nBut the scale and urgency of the data center boom has put these priorities on a collision course.\nAs the primary drivers of that conflict, data centers have a responsibility to help out. That\u2019s Brian Janous\u2019 philosophy. He\u2019s the cofounder of 25\nCloverleaf aims to build a data center campus that will draw up to 352030\u201c25\nTogether with We Energies and its parent company, WEC\n\u201cWEC\nThe key mechanism of the deal is what Janous called a \u201c\n\u201c\nTo be clear, this tariff structure is still being finalized and hasn\u2019t yet been submitted to state utility regulators, said Dan Krueger, WEC\u201c\u201c\u201c\n\u201c\nWEC3GW\nKrueger said that the gas buildout is part of a larger 9143GW2029\nJanous said he agreed with the Sierra Club\u2019s proposition that \u201c\u201c\n## A \u200b\u201c\nSimilar developer partnerships between utilities and data centers are popping up nationwide.\nIn Georgia, the Clean Energy Buyers Association and utility Georgia Power are negotiating to give tech companies more freedom to contract for clean energy supplies. In North Carolina, tariffs for long-duration energy storage, modular nuclear reactors, and other \u201cNVadvanced geothermal plant that Fervo Energy is planning.\n\u201c\u201c\nInsulating utility customers from bearing the costs of data center power demand is a core feature of these tariffs. Broader concerns over the costs that unchecked data center growth could impose have triggered pushback from communities, politicians, and regulators in data center hot spots. But Janous highlighted that Cloverleaf\u2019s Wisconsin project will have \u201c100\nThat\u2019s also good utility-ratemaking policy, said Chris Nagle, a principal in the energy practice at consultancy Charles River Associates, who worked on a \u201c\u201c\nAt the same time, Nagle continued, \u201c\nRight now, top-tier tech companies appear willing to pay extra for clean power, said Alex Kania, managing director of equity research at Marathon Capital, an investment banking firm focused on clean infrastructure. He pointed to reports that\nGiven that willingness to pay, \u201c\u201c\u2018\n## Bringing the data centers to where the clean power can be built\nBut cost is not the primary barrier to building clean power today.\nIn fact, portfolios of new solar, wind, and batteries are cheaper than new gas-fired power plants in most of the country. Instead, the core barrier to getting clean power online \u2014 be it for data centers or other large-scale power buyers, or even just for utilities \u2014 is the limited capacity of the power grid itself.\nAcross much of the U.S., hundreds of gigawatts of solar, wind, and battery projects are held up in yearslong waitlists to get interconnected to congested transmission grids. Facing this situation, some data center developers are targeting parts of the country where they can build their own clean power and avoid as much of the grid logjam as possible.\nIn November, for example, Google, infrastructure investor TPGunveiled a plan to invest $202030 into clusters of wind, solar, and batteries that are largely dedicated to powering newly built data centers.\nWith the right balance of wind, solar, and batteries, topped off by power from the connecting grid or from on-site fossil-gas generators, Intersect Power CEO\u201c80\nAnd importantly, that clean energy is \u201c\u201c\nThink tank Energy Innovation has cited this \u201c\nAnd while many existing data center hubs aren\u2019t well suited to energy parks, plenty of other places around the country are, said Gary Dorris, CEO\u201c\u201c100\nThat\u2019s not to say that building these energy parks will be simple. First, there\u2019s the sheer amount of land required. A gigawatt-scale data center may occupy a \u201c500010000\nAnd then there are the regulatory hurdles involved. Almost all U.S. utilities hold exclusive rights to provide power and build power-delivery infrastructure within the territories they serve. The exception is Texas, which has a uniquely competitive energy regulatory regime. Intersect Power plans to build its first energy park with Google and TPG\nCloverleaf\u2019s Janous highlighted this and other constraints to the energy-park concept.\nGetting the workforce to build large-scale projects in remote areas is another challenge, he added, as is accessing the fiber-optic data pipelines needed by data centers serving time- and bandwidth-sensitive tasks.\n\u201c\nOn the other hand, the task of training AI\u201c\n\u201c\u201cAI\n## Why relying on fossil gas doesn\u2019t make economic sense\nThe Sierra Club and other climate advocates would prefer data center demand is met with no new fossil-fuel power at all. But few, if any, industry analysts think that is realistic. So, the question becomes how much\nA growing number of companies are targeting data centers as potential new customers for gas-fired power, including oil and gas majors. ExxonMobil announced plans to 1GE\u201c\nPresident Donald Trump has also backed this idea of building fossil-fuel power plants for data centers. \u201c\u201c\nThe federal government doesn\u2019t regulate utilities and power plants, however \u2014 states do. And even if that weren\u2019t the case, Janous and Intersect Power\u2019s Kimber agreed that building utility-scale gas power plants solely for data centers is a nonstarter. \u201c\u201c\nKimber said that Intersect Power\u2019s energy-parks concept does include gas-fueled generators. But they\u2019ll be relatively cheap, allowing them to earn their keep even if run infrequently to fill the gaps at times when solar, wind, and batteries can\u2019t supply power. Eventually they can be replaced with next-generation storage technologies.\nThat\u2019s quite different from building a utility-scale power plant that must run most of the time for decades to pay back its cost, he said. \u201c\nNor can large-scale gas power plants be built quickly enough to match the pace that developers have set for themselves to get data centers up and running.

    "content":"Amid industry setbacks and federal funding losses, the company, which makes green steel without burning fossil fuels, has a robust plan for moving ahead.\n![](\nBy Sarah Shemkus\n5 June 2025\n* *\n![](\n(Boston Metal)\nMassachusetts-based Boston Metal is on the verge of earning its first revenue as it continues honing a novel steelmaking process so clean it can vent emissions into a parking lot the company shares with a day care center.\n\u201c\nThe technique, which was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is now being scaled up for commercialization, uses electricity to remove contaminants from iron ore, producing a small fraction of the emissions generated by traditional fossil fuel\u2013fired blast furnaces. Indeed, the technology releases no carbon dioxide \u2014 just oxygen \u2014 and the only greenhouse gas emissions are those associated with the electricity used to power the system.\nPromoting green steel was a major element of former President Joe Biden\u2019s economic and environmental agenda. However, the Trump administration\u2019s desire to boost fossil fuels has already undermined these efforts and left the future of the sector in question.\nAgainst that backdrop, Boston Metal, with its carefully calibrated business plan and lack of dependence on increasingly unreliable federal funding, seems to have unusually bright prospects.\nThe company was founded in 2013400range of backers including global steel giant ArcelorMittal, the venture-capital arm of oil company Saudi Aramco, global investment manager M&\nThe possible payoff is significant: Demand for low-emissions steel is expected to increase by at least 672030RMI\n\u201c\u201c\n## A novel way to refine iron ore\nThe task of greening steel production is daunting. Globally, nearly 192\nRoughly 90contributing to high pollution levels in the cities where they are located.\nAnother process, known as direct reduction of iron, or DRIDRIDRI\n\u201c\nBoston Metal sidesteps that complication by refining iron through a process called molten oxide electrolysis. Iron ore is poured into a brick-lined chamber, where it dissolves in an electrolyte solution. An electric current runs through the liquid, melting the ore. Contaminants in the ore \u2014 like alumina, silica, and calcia \u2014 are left behind in the solution, while the molten purified metal settles to the bottom of the chamber.\nWhen enough iron has accumulated, the chamber is tapped, in a sort of fiery, industrial analog to tapping a maple tree for sap. A meter-long bit drills into the cell, allowing the molten iron to flow out. Then the hole is plugged with a ceramic clay until the next tapping.\nThough the equipment runs constantly at a temperature of about 1600\nThe electricity powering the process runs from an anode at the top of the chamber to the molten metal, which acts as a cathode. The anode is one of Boston Metal\u2019s major technological innovations. For the equipment to produce significant quantities of molten iron, the anode must be made of a material that can resist corrosion in the oxygen-rich environment. MIT\nThe anode \u201c\nThe first trial runs in the MIT138000\nSeveral midsize systems also run in the facility as does one full-scale cell that can produce roughly a ton of purified iron per month using 10\n## Commercializing molten oxide electrolysis\nAs Boston Metal continues to refine its system, it is also trying to work its way toward profitability. To get there, company leaders have decided on a strategy that, perhaps unexpectedly, puts steel on the back burner for the moment.\nThe key is niobium, a metal that is valuable as an alloying element in steel production and that can be extracted from other materials using molten oxide electrolysis. Niobium sells for about $8274000900\nIn 2023\n\u201c\nThis graduated approach gives the company some stability at a time when the future of green steel in the U.S. is anything but certain.\nLast year, the Biden administration awarded $500 to two projects aiming to make low-emissions steel using hydrogen for DRI\u201c10\nBoston Metal, however, is somewhat insulated from these headwinds. While Trump\u2019s funding moves have created economic uncertainty, the company is not directly supported by any federal grants, though it has received some federal support in the past. The company is waiting to hear the fate of a $50\nBoston Metal plans to build a demonstration plant for steel production by 2028\nProducers using Boston Metal\u2019s technology are likely to seek out locations with a clean, low-priced electric supply to maximize the economic and environmental advantages, he said.\nBoston Metal\u2019s technology and that of other companies exploring the use of electricity hold a lot of promise, but plenty of questions and hurdles remain, Ramirez said.\n\u201c\u201c\nA correction was made on June 52025\n* Green steel\n* Clean industry\n* Northeast\n* Massachusetts\nSarah Shemkus is a reporter at Canary Media who is based in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and covers New England.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\nUpvotesNewestOldest\nS\nStar Jeffree\n0 points\n36 days ago\nHere\u2019s hoping their demo plant paves the way for\n## read next\n* ![Gray metal boxes lined up with a blue sky overhead ](\nBatteries\n### California has a new law to prevent big grid battery fires\n* ![Aerial shot of a large warehouse complex next to homes ](\nVirtual power plants\n### Can crowdsourcing help solve the data-center power crunch?\n* ![A large ship with cargo at a port ](\nMarine transport\n### Global rules to decarbonize ships delayed amid Trump\u2019s pushback\n* ![ ](\nPolitics\n### The DOE\u2019s loan office enters its \u2018energy dominance\u2019 era\n![](",

    "content":"The state\u2019s regulators and utilities are working out a mutually beneficial way to share the costs of the grid upgrades required to build more community solar.\n![](\nBy Jeff St. John\n4 June 2025\n* *\n!A person in a white hard hat and yellow work vest walks on grass between rows of solar panels\nA maintenance worker walks through a community solar farm in Grafton, Massachusetts. (Robert Nickelsberg\/Getty Images)\nA pesky question has long stalled efforts to expand U.S. power grids in the face of growing demand and surging renewable energy: Who should pay for the upgrades?\nAn under-the-radar breakthrough in Massachusetts may finally provide a template for answering that question.\nOver the past year or so, the state\u2019s largest utilities and regulators have\nIt\u2019s been a long time coming. The plans in question have gone through numerous iterations since utilities, regulators, and solar developers started working on them about six years ago, making progress hard to track. And the name they settled on \u2014 \u201c\nBut behind the staid name lies a significant advance for a state striving to fairly allocate the costs of shifting to clean energy, said Kate Tohme, director of interconnection policy at Massachusetts-based community solar developer New Leaf Energy. In fact, advocates working on similar efforts in states from New York to California are \u201c\nThe roughly $334CIP\nThat doesn\u2019t mean developers are getting a free ride, however. They\u2019ll still have to pay a portion of those costs back as they\u2019re connected to the grid, reducing the burden on customers over time. And every project in question had to prove to regulators that the grid improvements at large also deliver customer benefits, whether through improved grid reliability, enabling access to cheaper community solar power, or both.\nMassachusetts can\u2019t avoid these kinds of grid investments if it\u2019s to meet its clean energy and electrification goals, according to Tohme, a former official at the state Department of Public Utilities who was directly involved in some of the earliest CIP5019902030\n\u201c\u201c\n## Sharing costs to solve the solar logjam\nThe landmark plan emerged as a response to what might be seen as a clean-energy success story \u2014 Massachusetts had too much community solar trying to get onto an overly crowded grid.\nThe launch of the 2018\n\u201c\u201c\nNational Grid was encountering the same kind of interconnection backlog and upgrade cost challenges that have tied up utility-scale solar and wind projects on high-voltage transmission grids across the country. The main difference is that community solar projects connect to lower-voltage grids that carry power from big substations to end customers. Similar backlogs have dogged other states with lots of Minnesota and\nOne of the best-established ways to relieve interconnection stresses is for utilities and grid operators to stop painstakingly studying each project one at a time and batch them instead.\nIt also allows grid-upgrade costs to be shared among the projects in the cluster, rather than foisting them on whichever project engineers determined would push that part of the grid over its existing capacity limit, thus triggering an upgrade, Porcaro said.\nBut the approach has its limits. \u201c\nTo deal with that disconnect, \u201c2021\nNational Grid and other utilities already plan ahead to accommodate growing electricity demand from customers or to serve big new developments like housing subdivisions or factories, Porcaro noted. The goal of the provisional system planning approach was to find a way to similarly pay in advance for proactive grid investments to bring community solar projects online.\n\u201c\u201c\n## Figuring out a fair share\nIn late 2022\u201c\nEversource estimated at the time that it would cost about $116140370\nThe risk of this approach is that some of the projects involved in the group study would end up dropping out, leaving customers on the hook for their unpaid share, Lavelle Freeman, Eversource\u2019s vice president of distribution system planning, told Canary Media in a 2023\nFortunately, the same kinds of upgrades that expand capacity for community solar also improve customer reliability and provide headroom for growing electrical loads.\n\u201c**\u201c** We developed a very rigorous algorithm to calculate the reliability benefits,\u201d which ended up showing a roughly 5050\u201c\nTo be clear, there are significant risks to committing utility customers\u2019 money to building out grid infrastructure to serve the needs of community solar projects. In Massachusetts, the state Attorney General\u2019s Office is tasked with protecting utility customers\u2019 interests in regulatory proceedings like these.\nA senior official at the Attorney General\u2019s Office who was involved with the CIP\u201c\u201c\nOn the other hand, the official said, \u201c\nThese concerns from the Attorney General\u2019s Office pushed the finalized version of CIP\nHaving a known per-kilowatt cost locked in well in advance is also helpful, said Mike Judge, currently undersecretary of energy for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, who spoke to Canary Media in 2023\nDevelopers often need to secure interconnection rights before they can secure the financing and start signing up rs that allow them to move forward with projects, he said.\n\u201c370\u201c5\n## From reactive to proactive\nThe model that Eversource established for the Marion-Fairhaven project is largely mirrored in the 10300MW\u201c\nMassachusetts isn\u2019t the only state working on policies that aim to spur grid expansion while keeping customers\u2019 power costs in check, Tohme said.\nBut to Tohme\u2019s knowledge, no other state has accomplished what Massachusetts has with its CIP\u201c\nAt the same time, Tohme pointed out, the CIPs remain a response to a problem that\u2019s been hounding the state for years now: projects stuck behind an inadequately upgraded grid. The next logical step is to figure out where grid upgrades should be made before\nThat\u2019s one of the goals laid out for the state\u2019s three major investor-owned utilities under a sprawling grid-modernization mandate created as part of a major energy and climate law passed in 2022\nCIPs are a part of that broader plan, he said. But the modernization plans are \u201c\u2018EV\nGiven how long it took to figure out CIPs, clean energy developers have reason to worry that this even more sweeping and complicated planning task could take even longer. Clean-energy industry group Advanced Energy United has\nPorcaro highlighted other work that can help get more clean energy connected even before the grid gets built out. He pointed to National Grid\u2019s\nThese kinds of \u201c, as they\u2019re generally known, could help \u201c\nMeanwhile, the clock is ticking on building out a grid that can support Massachusetts\u2019 clean energy and electrification ambitions. Later this year, the Department of Public Utilities is expected to issue its ground rules on how utilities should start to calculate the fair sharing of costs between their customers and the community solar and battery projects trying to connect to their grids under the Electric Sector Modernization Plans, Tohme said.\nOnce that\u2019s done, utilities and other stakeholder groups will bring cost-sharing proposals to the regulator and start to hash them out, she said. \u201d\nBut just because it\u2019s going to be hard doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t worth doing, she said. \u201c\n* Solar\n* Clean energy\n* Policy & regulation\n* Utilities\n* Northeast\n* Massachusetts\nJeff St. John is chief reporter and policy specialist at Canary Media.

(Ned Gerard\/Connecticut Post via Getty Images)\nWhen Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, first nominated Marissa Gillett to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority in 2019\u201c\nPublic utility commissions are essential but largely invisible forces regulating and shaping electricity, gas, and water services at the state level. Traditionally, these boards have been thought of as working in tandem with utilities, rarely challenging their proposals and claims. Recently, though, the tides have shifted, as more states and advocacy groups look at ways for commissioners to advance state energy policy.\nThe need for decisive action from utility commissions is becoming more acute as electricity prices climb almost everywhere in the country and many states push to meet decarbonization goals. The regulatory status quo just doesn\u2019t lend itself to the systemic changes needed to fight these battles.\nGillett has been hailed by some as an exemplar of the assertive regulator, bringing a decidedly proactive sensibility to her work on the Connecticut commission, commonly called PURA\n\u201c\n## Moving beyond \u200b\u2018\nThe traditional model for investor-owned utilities guarantees them a set rate of return on every dollar spent building new distribution lines, upgrading substations, and other such projects. This dynamic has led to criticism that utilities are prone to overspending on infrastructure that might not be in the interest of customers or the environment, for the simple reason that it will bolster their earnings and please their investors.\nA key job of leaders like Gillett is to weigh these utility requests against the need for adequate, reliable infrastructure, and the needs of consumers and the state\u2019s energy policy goals. But for too long, critics say, commissioners have functioned more as umpires calling balls and the occasional strike, approving most utility requests.\nBefore coming to Connecticut, Gillett worked for seven years at the Maryland Public Service Commission, contributing to the development of initiatives including the state\u2019s electric vehicle programs and its offshore wind plan. After a brief stint with the Energy Storage Association, a trade group, she threw her hat in the ring for the Connecticut commissioner position.\nGillett came into the job ready to be the \u201c\u201c\n\u201c\nBut she was not willing to accept that the only evidence available was what was contained in utility filings and the responses to them.

In the United States, around 40\n\u201cCEO\u201c\nAtmosZero spun out of Bandhauer\u2019s research at Colorado State University in 202130326502026\n!Two men stand inside a manufacturing facility with industrial equipment in the background Todd Bandhauer (left) and Addison Stark (right) of AtmosZero stand on the floor of their industrial-heat-pump startup\u2019s new factory. (Alison F. Takemura\/Canary Media)\nThe factory floor was quiet when I visited last month, with custom-made parts in open boxes or on pallets awaiting assembly. But Stark said he sees the facility getting much busier as the company works to fill demand from potential buyers, who face increasing pressure from state regulators and their own customers to slash gas-related pollution.\n\u201c\u201c\n## A cleaner way to make steam\nIndustrial heat accounts for about 100\nHeat pumps, by contrast, move heat instead of making it. The appliances use electricity and a refrigerant to gather thermal energy from someplace else \u2014 say, the open air or a water pipe \u2014 and concentrate it using a compressor to deliver the heat where it\u2019s needed. This process can be 300400\nAtmosZero and a handful of other manufacturers are developing new heat pumps that will allow the technology to replace an even larger share of gas-fired boilers in factories.\nExisting heat-pump models can churn out heat up to about 16032044ACEEE20039255\n\u201c\nAt the AtmosZero factory, Bandhauer broke down how the Boiler 20\nThe compressor wheel I held had precisely sculpted blades that swept out in a tight spiral.

(AtmosZero)\nStill, for all the apparent benefits, industrial heat pumps on the market today have struggled to gain widespread adoption. To start, they\u2019re more expensive to install than gas boilers, which can last for decades \u2014 limiting the business case for replacing them. In the United States, fossil gas has historically been cheap enough in many places that a boiler has cost less to run than a heat pump, even though the latter uses a fraction of the energy.\nStates like adopting policies to help address these hurdles. That includes incentives for manufacturers to invest in tech that slashes emissions, air-quality regulations that limit pollution from their operations, and\nDespite the technology\u2019s high price tag, heat pumps can deliver significant savings on factory owners\u2019 utility bills, according to ACEEE\n\u201c\n## AtmosZero\u2019s modular approach\nAtmosZero isn\u2019t the only company making steam-producing heat pumps. Other manufacturers \u2014 including GEA\nThese systems often supplement existing fossil-fueled boilers by capturing a plant\u2019s excess heat that would otherwise be wasted. That approach helps maximize a heat pump\u2019s efficiency: Since the waste heat is already toasty, it\u2019s easier for the tech to turn that into even higher-temperature heat for making steam.\nCustomers often want to actively harness this throwaway warmth to keep electric bills as low as possible, Checknoff said. But because every facility is different, installing a heat pump to slurp up that thermal energy can be costly and cumbersome.\nAtmosZero is aiming for economies of scale, similar to how solar panels and home heat pumps are mass-manufactured and deployed in a modular way. \u201c\nThe startup\u2019s heat pump can be installed in a day, requiring only hookups to electricity and water lines and the factory\u2019s control system. It\u2019s as simple as replacing an old gas boiler with a new one, he said. And at New Belgium\u2019s brewery, putting in the pilot heat pump this spring didn\u2019t disrupt operations.\n\u201c\n!Graphic of different configurations for installing an AtmosZero heat pump and making steam sans carbon emissions AtmosZero\u2019s electric heat pump can be installed in a variety of configurations to produce steam (red) using thermal energy harvested from outdoor air. (AtmosZero)\nAtmosZero\u2019s product does have a key trade-off: It\u2019s not as efficient as heat pumps that competitors install to harness waste heat. Those systems produce more heat with the same amount of energy. That ability is measured with what\u2019s called the coefficient of performance, or COPCOPCOP\nBut the Boiler 20\n## Building a better heat pump\nAt his desk inside the AtmosZero factory, a young engineer named Mason Mollenhauer pulled up on his computer screen a rendering of the 65030\nNew Belgium, the famed maker of Fat Tire Ale, is using the steam to boil wort, a sugary liquid, with bitter hops to create the libation\u2019s flavor and aroma profile before it\u2019s fermented into beer.

The streamlined model has fewer parts, reducing costs and making it easier to service, Bandhauer said. The team is also finessing the design of its crucial compressor wheels.\n![]( An AtmosZero employee finalizes construction of the company's Boiler 2.0 air-source heat exchanger at its facility in Loveland, Colorado.

The startup needed permission from the Army Corps of Engineers, which governs the navigable waterways of the United States, as well as sign-off from the Port and other local and state authorities. Securing all those approvals ended up taking about two years, after which Eco Wave Power installed and commissioned the site in just four months, Braverman said.\nBut she was encouraged by that timeline, since this was the first-ever U.S. installation of its kind, and even well-known technologies have struggled through longer permitting processes.\nIn the meantime, Tamminen, who architected California\u2019s wildly successful Million Solar Roofs initiative for former Gov.

The problem is that the Federal Power Act \u2014 passed in 1920FERC\nAs a result, it takes eight years on average to relicense an existing hydropower facility, according to the National Hydropower Association, the leading U.S. trade group. That\u2019s more than five times slower than licensing for the typical atomic power station. (Nuclear, hydroelectricity\u2019s closest competitor for clean, always-available power, is also notorious for its slow permitting timeline.)\n\u201c\u201c18\nWith no central body in charge of permitting hydropower plants, multiple state agencies have been known to take advantage of the once-in-a-generation certification process \u2014 eliciting support for tangentially related projects from dam owners who once represented a big and growing business.\n\u201c\u201c50\nAt times, those concessions have little to do with the functioning of the hydropower plant itself. Woolf cited examples of dam owners pressed to build an amphitheater for Boy Scouts, and to fund the construction of regional roads that wouldn\u2019t even go to the plant.\n\u201c\n\u201c1970\u201c\nThe eight-year timeline for relicensing is just an average.\nIn Idaho, the Hells Canyon hydroelectric plant has gone for 2015\nTo continue operating, hydroplant owners obtain one-year extensions as they inch toward full licenses. \u201c\u201c\n!Equipment and a dam on a river at night time Along the border of Idaho and Oregon, the Snake River rushes through Hells Canyon Dam as night falls.

For years, the wind and solar industries have benefited from a rule that treats facilities as new if owners reinvest at least 80\nBut so far, no hydroelectric facility has made use of the federal investment tax credit except one small plant that was destroyed in a flood, thus requiring a total reconstruction. That\u2019s because until recently the industry still lacked clear guidance on how to apply the tax credit.\n\u201c8080\u201c8050\nWhile renewables face ongoing opposition from the Trump administration, the president specifically named hydropower as a key priority in his Day 1\u201c\n## A fishy problem\nProviding safe passage for fish through dams is a perpetual challenge, especially at older facilities that lack proper infrastructure.

American eels pose an even greater problem, as the snake-like fish \u2014 which can make up as much as\nOne of the simplest and most widely used tools to prevent fish from being killed in a dam\u2019s turbines is a screen that blocks them from entering the plant\u2019s water intake.

Less practical are trap-and-haul systems where fish are manually captured and set free above the dam.\n\u201c\u201c\n!People stand along a waterway with rushing water along steps A fish ladder at the Bonneville Dam in Oregon. (\nThe key to overcoming the issue may be marrying the refurbishment of hydropower stations with environmental upgrades.

The U.S. is now actively looking to restart its nuclear program, with the once far-fetched prospect of new large-scale reactors under serious consideration. Even if hydropower can similarly flip its fortunes, few in the industry anticipate an appetite in the U.S. for a Hoover Dam\u2013size project. Still, there is ample opportunity for new hydroelectric capacity.\nJust 3800002012\u201c\nThere are plenty of hydropower critics who welcome that stagnation. The history of damming rivers is rife with ecological destruction that fish-passage routes don\u2019t entirely solve, as well as social upheaval from land seizures that uprooted poor, Black, and Indigenous communities from their homes to make way for new reservoirs.\nAnd in parts of the U.S. where water is growing more scarce as the climate warms, reservoirs are drying up.

(\nAIdrive up energy costs for consumers. Or, they could simply agree to use less electricity during the handful of hours per year when the grid is under the greatest stress, making it possible for tech companies to get the power they need without straining the system.\nIt sounds like an easy fix, but in reality it\u2019s complicated to modulate the demand of a data center that can use as much power as a small city. That\u2019s why it\u2019s rarely done today. In fact, a \u201c\nNow, the tech giant is taking its flexibility efforts one step further and applying the concept to the machine learning operations that underpin its large language models, the technology driving the current boom in AI\nThis month, Michael Terrell, Google\u2019s head of advanced energy, &TVA\u201c\nGoogle\u2019s new announcements are a really big deal, said Tyler Norris, a Duke University doctoral fellow and former solar developer and special adviser at the Department of Energy. That\u2019s because they\u2019re the first example of the kind of collaboration between data centers and utilities that needs to happen to keep costs from spiraling out of control.\nEstimates of power demand from the AIare all over the map and hard to trust, but at a minimum, most experts agree that data center demand for electricity outstrips supply. Consumer advocates and state lawmakers are increasingly worried that this dynamic is going to cause electricity rates to surge, as utilities incur the costs of building the power plants and grid infrastructure to serve data centers, and potentially push those costs onto customer bills.\nThat supply-demand imbalance is also a problem for firms like Google and its competitors, which are locked in a multibillion-dollar race to build the best possible AI\nOver the past five years or so, through its \u201c\nUntil recently, it hadn\u2019t messed with power demand for machine learning. This sort of flexibility is new territory for utilities and grid operators, too: It\u2019s not standard practice to allow large customers to come online only if they agree to curtail their power use, Norris pointed out.\n\u201c\u201c\nFlexible data centers like Google\u2019s may have a significant advantage in getting those all-important electrons in the near term. A more rigid project may have to wait years to come online as grid infrastructure and power plants are built; a flexible data center, meanwhile, could be fast-tracked for interconnection using the grid capacity that\u2019s already available.\nThe solution has its limitations, Terrell told Canary Media in an interview, but where it makes sense, it can be a powerful tool.\n\u201c\u201c\n## The massive potential of shifting when data centers use power\nThe grid is crowded \u2014 but there\u2019s plenty of room for data centers that can be flexible. That\u2019s what Norris and a team of researchers at Duke University concluded in a February\nThe analysis found nearly 10005\u201c100\nThere\u2019s a simple explanation for this spare space: Grids and power plants are overbuilt to meet peak demands, or \u201c\nIt\u2019s not a new idea in principle.

In fact, \u201cAI\nIn part because of this secrecy, it\u2019s unclear how data center growth will play out in the real world. Most projections are based on speculative requests from developers seeking power in multiple locations for projects that may or may not end up being built.\nBut forecasts of data center growth generally indicate that they\u2019re set to overwhelm the grid.\nA December report from consultancy Grid Strategies found that five-year growth forecasts for U.S. utilities and grid operators have quintupled between 20222024, with data center hot spots such as Virginia, Georgia, Texas, and swaths of the Midwest particularly impacted. The past month has seen utilities in\nThat\u2019s going to drive up utility rates, which are already rising due to a number of factors, including expensive investments in grid maintenance and expansion. While it can take time for the costs of accommodating new data centers to arrive on customers\u2019 utility bills, the sheer scale of that expansion means that \u201c\nThose future costs are starting to pile up.\nGeorgia Power won regulatory approval earlier this year to move ahead with plans for a controversial and unprecedentedly rapid buildout of power plants, almost entirely based on huge, uncertain forecasts of data center growth.

Behind the arch is a building with pillars and gold dome\nThe New Hampshire State House in Concord, New Hampshire (Joseph Prezioso\/AFP via Getty Images)\nA new state law set to take effect next month marks the end of New Hampshire\u2019s flirtation with offshore wind \u2014 at least for now.\nThe\n\u201c\nThe move comes as President Donald Trump attempts to stop the emerging offshore wind industry in its tracks. On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order pausing all permitting and lease sales for new projects, and in the months that followed his administration has attempted to halt the construction of fully permitted offshore wind developments, including, most recently, the nearly complete Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island.\nOther governors in New England, a region that has been counting on offshore wind for climate action and grid reliability, have been resolute in pushing projects forward. In fact, every coastal New England state aside from New Hampshire is party to a lawsuit seeking to overturn Trump\u2019s offshore wind executive order.\nThe law marks a shift from the stance taken by previous governor, Republican Chris Sununu, who was in office from 20172025\nSwing state New Hampshire has long been a libertarian-leaning outlier in deeply Democratic New England. On climate and energy issues, New Hampshire has generally been less aggressive than neighboring states: It doesn\u2019t have legally mandated greenhouse gas reduction targets, has pulled back on energy-efficiency goals and programming, and recently all but drained its renewable energy fund to pay for other state needs.\nFor a time, however, the state seemed on the verge of embracing offshore wind. In 201920212022\n\u201c\nThis year\u2019s legislative session, however, saw a flurry of bills aimed at keeping the New Hampshire government out of the business of offshore wind. One proposal even\nThe recently signed law is less aggressive, pulling away from offshore wind without prohibiting it. To soften the blow further, the state Senate, led by Democratic state Sen. David Watters, amended the legislation to make it clear that the energy innovation office would still have the authority to do work related to offshore wind if interest is revived in the future.\n\u201c\nDuring the legislative process, however, it was clear that many interested parties saw the bill as a referendum on offshore wind in general, not merely the structure of government offices and committees. Public comments during a House hearing on the bill in February dwelled heavily on the perceived dangers of offshore wind, including potential threats to wildlife, possible hikes in electricity prices, and concerns about the intermittent nature of wind power.\nThe movement against offshore wind, observers said, is driven by a mix of national conservative hostility toward renewable energy and New Hampshire\u2019s unique character. The state Senate is reasonably open to renewables, Watters said. However, the 400\nFurthermore, the state has always been fiscally conservative, priding itself on its lack of sales and personal income taxes. It was always unlikely to offer tax incentives, like neighboring states, or take the risk of getting locked into a power purchase agreement at prices that could exceed market rates, said Sam Evans-Brown, executive director of Clean Energy New Hampshire.\n\u201c\nStill, some clean energy advocates are concerned that the offshore wind law is a troublesome step backwards when the state needs to be charging ahead on renewables. There is widespread agreement that New England needs more power supply to help control soaring electricity prices and maintain grid reliability. At the same time, observers said, restraints on natural gas supplies make more gas-fired power generation unlikely, and building new nuclear facilities would be contentious; either option would take years to begin sending electrons into the grid.\nNow, the Trump administration continues to throw up as many roadblocks as possible to offshore wind, potentially scuttling what may be the region\u2019s best \u2014 and speediest \u2014 chance to build large-scale energy generation.\nIt makes no sense to let ideological objections to renewable energy get in the way of considering all available resources, said Nick Krakoff, senior attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation.\n\u201c\u201c\nFor others, the new law is a reasonable response to political realities in New Hampshire. If the state was never going to be a major supporter of offshore wind, it makes sense to focus the Office of Energy Innovation on measures that might actually have a fighting chance, Evans-Brown said, pointing to microgrids, battery developments, demand-flexibility programs, and electrification as promising options that would help the state make the most of the power production it has.\nAdvocates and policymakers across the board, however, are holding on to hope that while the state explores other courses of action, the development of offshore wind is merely delayed.\n\u201c\u201c\n* Offshore wind\n* Policy & regulation\n* Wind\n* Northeast\n* New Hampshire\nSarah Shemkus is a reporter at Canary Media who is based in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and covers New England.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\n## read next\n* ![Gray metal boxes lined up with a blue sky overhead ](\nBatteries\n### California has a new law to prevent big grid battery fires\n* ![Aerial shot of a large warehouse complex next to homes ](\nVirtual power plants\n### Can crowdsourcing help solve the data-center power crunch?\n* ![A large ship with cargo at a port ](\nMarine transport\n### Global rules to decarbonize ships delayed amid Trump\u2019s pushback\n* ![ ](\nPolitics\n### The DOE\u2019s loan office enters its \u2018energy dominance\u2019 era\n![](",

(Joe Sohm\/Visions of America\/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)\nA bill on its way to the governor\u2019s desk in New Hampshire could spur new, energy-efficient housing development in the state as soon as this summer, supporters say.\nNew Hampshire legislators on Thursday voted to adopt a loan program that will create a new way to finance clean energy and energy efficiency while making it easier to build residential developments in a state facing an acute housing shortage. The measure passed unanimously in the House and has broad support from Democrats, Republicans, environmental advocates, and the business community.\nGov. Kelly Ayotte (R) is expected to sign the bill into law shortly. Individual cities and towns will then need to vote to authorize the program in their communities, which could happen as soon as their annual spring town meetings in March and April. New construction projects could start taking advantage of the loans as soon as July or August, said developer Stephen Duprey, a supporter of the program.\n\u201c\u201c\nCommercial property-assessed clean energy \u2014 or C-PACE \u2014 loans let commercial building developers and owners borrow money for clean energy and energy efficiency projects from a private lender but pay the money back through an added line item on their property tax bills. When the property is sold, the buyer takes on the loan as well, getting a higher tax bill but a building with lower operating costs. At the same time, the loans have longer terms than conventional financing, leading to lower payments.\nC-PACE has been nominally on the books in New Hampshire since 2010\n\u201c\nThen, last year, Duprey had a conversation with a lender who asked why New Hampshire didn\u2019t have a C-PACE program. Duprey had a vague memory of the term but asked for more information about the program.\nAfter listening to the lender\u2019s explanation, he realized the model had potential to spur development of multifamily residential buildings \u2014 homes the state direly needs. If a developer uses C-PACE to finance the energy components of a new build \u2014 heat pumps, solar panels, insulation, efficient windows \u2014 they can take out a smaller mortgage for the construction and need less equity to fund the development, he said. That frees up money for building more units.\nFor Duprey, any benefits for energy efficiency or clean energy are secondary. \u201c\u201c\nSo Duprey asked the staff at the New Hampshire Business Finance Authority, of which he is vice chair, to investigate the existing C-PACE legislation and find out why it didn\u2019t work. He discovered that the original version of the law put too many restrictions on the program to make it appealing. Municipalities were asked to carry too much of the administrative burden, he said. Banks were wary of a new kind of loan coming in and competing with their conventional products, Evans-Brown said.\nDuprey, a former chair of the state Republican committee, began reaching out to his contacts in the legislature and the business community to work on a C-PACE overhaul that would eliminate these barriers.\nThe resulting bill has garnered widespread approval.

Under the 20222033420262027\nThis sudden change puts states in a tight spot: If wind or solar projects can\u2019t get started within a year, they\u2019ll be considerably more expensive. And power demand and utility bills are already rising nationwide.\nAll of these factors are putting pressure on state energy regulators, who typically move at an exceedingly deliberative pace, which is to say, very slowly. The usual months of back and forth and obscure bureaucratic wrangling could force customers to pay billions of dollars more, based on the new deadlines from the Republican majority in Congress.\nIn recent weeks, Colorado became one of the first states to try getting ahead of that damaging outcome, creating a playbook others could learn from. Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, kicked off the effort with an Aug. 1\u201c\n\u201c\nTaking up that call, key players in the Colorado energy establishment 22\u201c20264200300\nOn Aug. 27\nDelivering on the faster schedule could save Xcel\u2019s Colorado customers $520\nFor several years running, solar, wind, and batteries have accounted for over 90 to the U.S. power grid.

Federal tax credits can cut project costs by more than 30\n\u201cS2\u201c\nIndeed, it\u2019s rare to find enthusiastic agreement between a monopoly utility and a ratepayer advocate, whose job is to contest utility spending that could raise bills for customers. In this case, the clear threat of higher energy prices from Trump administration policies has created an unusual alignment of interests. Ricketts refers to this catalyst as \u201c\nSpeeding up regulatory approvals is valuable on a number of levels. The typical pace of states\u2019 energy infrastructure deliberations has been out of step both with the urgency of the climate crisis and the more recent spike in electricity demand. Faster approvals of cheap clean energy projects could push down prices compared to further reliance on expensive, aging coal and gas plants. But the exigencies of climate change, demand growth, or customer wellbeing haven\u2019t prompted the kind of speed-up that Trump\u2019s reworking of federal energy policy achieved.\nThat said, the acceleration will be limited in its scope. States will have to allocate time and effort to salvage just some of the energy benefits that had been promised for a decade to come.

    "content":"Solar produced nearly as much electricity as gas in the nation\u2019s most populous state in 2024\n![](\nBy Julian Spector\n15 April 2025\n* *\n!Ground-mounted solar panels and other energy equipment in a sandy outdoor expanse.\nTopaz Solar Farm, a 550-megawatt power plant in San Luis Obispo County, California. (Sarah Swenty\/USFWS)\nCalifornia, for all its talk of clean energy and climate leadership, has long depended on fossil gas to keep its lights on. A decade ago, gas provided around 60\nCalifornia\u2019s solar systems, from rooftop panels to massive desert installations, generated nearly as much electricity as its gas plants last year, according to data pulled from think tank Ember\u2019s 2012\nSolar far outpaces all other electricity sources in new power plant construction, not just in California but in Texas and the nation as a whole. But that metric is measured in megawatts of production capacity \u2014 it doesn\u2019t tell us how much electricity solar panels actually make in the course of a year. Solar produces only when the sun shines, so it needs more megawatts of nameplate generating capacity to rival sources like gas or nuclear that can operate around the clock.\nThat\u2019s why this chart is so striking: It displays actual electricity production in California throughout 202430\nThis inflection point represents the culmination of yearslong trends. Gas surged to a record level in 2012hot summer nights and mild shoulder months alike.\nOver the last decade, it\u2019s worth noting, generation from nuclear, wind, and geothermal has stayed flat, and hydropower fluctuated with the annual weather patterns. Those carbon-free sources all have their own passionate advocates and deeply researched reports from the Department of Energy on how they can break out of stasis and grow again. But solar is the only one of the bunch consistently increasing production year over year.\nThat\u2019s not guaranteed to always be the case. The Republican-led Congress still could axe federal tax credits that currently support renewable installations for the next decade. California has also gotten in its own way, as when Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s handpicked utility regulators chose to dismantle the prevailing rules for rooftop solar, greatly diminishing the pace of residential installations.\nNonetheless, if gas power production continues its downward plunge, California will eventually have to figure some things out. Specifically, it needs other tools to ensure on-demand power through the nights and weather patterns that dampen solar production.\nState grid planners have ordered utilities to start procuring long-duration energy storage, a category of technologies promising to deliver steady clean power for far longer than lithium-ion batteries can manage at today\u2019s price points. The state is also taking early steps to open up its coastline for offshore wind development; the deep Pacific seabed calls for floating turbines, a newer technology that has not yet been built in the U.S. Efforts to better connect the western grid could also make it easier to balance supply and demand across the region.\nCalifornia, whose state economy would rank fifth among the world\u2019s nations, is not a place that can change course in an instant. But this impending unseating of gas power by solar shows what can happen over a decade of dedicated policy, regulatory, and business efforts to push down carbon emissions and accelerate clean energy. It took time to get to this point, but now the results are undeniable.\nLove Canary Media and find our reporting valuable? Please consider financially supporting our work with a donation.

(Allen Tran via Getty Images)\nAs Illinois looks to prepare its electric grid for the future, a new voluntary program in the Chicago area promises to lower costs for both customers and the utility system as a whole.\nComEd is finalizing plans to roll out time-of-use rates in 20266597\nUnder a plan before state utility regulators, customers who sign up would pay a much steeper energy-delivery charge during afternoon and early evening hours but see a significant discount overnight. The goal is to shift use to hours when the grid tends to be less congested as well as deliver cleaner and cheaper power.\n\u201c\nMost standard customers are set to pay an energy-delivery charge of 59\u201c107173\n\u201c17\nUnder the proposal, most time-of-use rate customers would pay delivery rates of around 46179\nThe details were approved in January by the Illinois Commerce Commission but put on hold last Thursday after commissioners agreed to consider a request by ComEd to also incorporate energy-supply charges into the program. (The initial proposal included only the portion of customers\u2019 bills that pays for the delivery of energy but not the cost of electricity itself.)\nThe Citizens Utility Board is happy with the plan approved in January, DeBellis said, and it wants to ensure a delivery-only option remains for customers who buy power from alternative retail electric suppliers since these customers would not be able to participate in a supply-charge ComEd program. The utility watchdog also would have liked the \u201c\n\u201cHVAC\u201c\nThe prospect of limiting air conditioning on hot afternoons could dissuade people from enrolling in the program, DeBellis continued. \u201c\n## Incentivizing EVs\nConsumer advocates have long asked for time-of-use rates, which are considered crucial as Illinois moves toward its goal of\n\u201c\nPeople with electric vehicles will save an extra $2\n\u201cEV\nRichard McCann, a consultant who testified before regulators on behalf of the Citizens Utility Board and the Environmental Defense Fund, recommended that in order to qualify for rebates for level 2\nDeBellis and his wife recently bought an EV\u201c\n\u201cEV\u201c\n## Pilot lessons\nComEd crafted the time-of-use program after a four-year pilot and a public comment process overseen by state regulators. The pilot was focused on the energy supply part of the bill, but DeBellis noted that the lessons apply to any time-of-use program, since demand peaks are the same regardless of which part of the bill one looks at.\nThe pilot program\u2019s final annual report showed that both EV\u201c6EV10307020232024\nOverall, in the pilot\u2019s final year, energy usage did shift significantly from peak hours to night-time hours thanks to an increasing number of EV\nIn 202120221900EV\nMany utilities around the country already offer time-of-use programs: 42829\nComEd\u2019s filings with state regulators include a survey of 15\nComEd also saw larger reduction in summer peak-time electricity demand than many of the other time-of-use rates. ComEd\u2019s program structure was similar to that of the other utilities, the company doing the study found, though in California, peak times were later in the afternoon, likely because of the state\u2019s climate and proliferation of solar energy.\n## Hours and education\nThe program is designed to be revenue-neutral, meaning ComEd won\u2019t earn more or less depending on when people use energy. Still, it has potential to lower costs to the system overall by helping to make more efficient use of existing infrastructure and postponing the need for new generation or transmission investments.\nThe new time-of-use rate would only apply only to residents. Industrial and commercial customers already have an incentive to use power at night, since their energy-delivery charge is based on their highest 30966\nComEd has since 2007\u201c1\n\u201c\u201c\nSome clean-energy groups had argued for a program that automatically enrolls residents unless they opted out. DeBellis said the Citizens Utility Board promoted the opt-in version that is currently proposed.\n\u201c\nThe Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, introduced into the state legislature in February and backed by a coalition of advocacy groups, would mandate large utilities offer residential time-of-use rates, outlining a structure similar to what ComEd is planning. After the rates have been in place for a year, the Illinois Commerce Commission could do a study to see if the rates are indeed reducing fossil-fuel use and work with utilities to adjust if needed.\nWhile the commission\u2019s ruling last week reopens debate about the program\u2019s structure, a ComEd spokesperson said the company is confident it will be available by next year.\n* Utilities\n* Emissions reduction\n* EV\n* Midwest\n* Illinois\nKari Lydersen is a contributing reporter at Canary Media who covers Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\nUpvotesNewestOldest\nR\nRob\n0 points\n56 days ago\nIt's not clear how this program (ComEd\u2019s Rate BEST)compares with the currently available ComEd\u2019s Hourly Pricing program, Rate BESH (Basic Electric Service Hourly Pricing).

    "content":"The legislation would scale back incentives for residential solar and allow a nuclear power plant to benefit from renewable energy programs, among other changes.\n![](\nBy Sarah Shemkus\n28 April 2025\n* *\n!Ornate government building with a blue flag and a gold dome, against a cloudy blue sky\nThe Connecticut State Capitol in Hartford. (Till Westermayer)\nConnecticut lawmakers are touting newly introduced legislation as a way to lower out-of-control power bills, but opponents say it could devastate the state\u2019s renewable energy progress. Provisions of the complex, 80\n\u201c\nConnecticut\u2019s high electricity rates \u2014 clean energy programs are driving high prices.\nThat belief is the basis of some provisions in\nThe proposed legislation includes several sections that do not explicitly address clean energy. It calls for the creation of an in-state procurement authority to watch the power markets and, ideally, buy electricity at better prices. The bill would also eliminate the sales tax on electricity purchased by commercial and industrial users, and mandate an expansion of variable time-of-use rates, which nudge households to use less energy during high-demand times by raising the price of electricity.\nRenewable energy advocates, however, are focused on three elements they claim would completely undermine state support for clean energy and energy-efficiency programs without creating any overall savings for the public.\n## Nuclear credits would undermine renewables\nThe first measure that worries advocates is a small wording change that would define existing nuclear power generation in the state \u2014 a category that includes only the Millstone Power Station \u2014 as a Class I renewable energy source. This designation would allow Millstone to sell renewable energy credits (RECs) as part of the state\u2019s renewable portfolio standard.\nUnder the standard, utilities must buy RECs to offset a certain percentage of the power they sell. That proportion rises over time: This year, for example, Connecticut utilities must procure enough renewable energy to meet 3032\nIf Millstone were allowed to sell Class I RECs, it could do so at much lower prices than other clean energy sources because the nuclear plant is already built and running without this added financial support, said Francis Pullaro, president of renewable energy nonprofit RENEWREC\nThere would also be little need for solar or wind RECs in the market if Millstone were allowed to sell credits. In 20233326REC\nThe effect would be to render the renewable portfolio standard essentially meaningless, he said.\n\u201cRPS\n## Removing incentives for residential solar\nAnother major issue advocates have flagged in the bill is a proposed change to how homeowners with solar panels are compensated when their systems generate extra power that flows onto the grid, a process called net metering. The legislation would allow homeowners to receive credit only for the supply of excess power they generate, and not for the costs of distribution or transmission, which are currently part of the compensation calculations. The rationale for this change stems from a concern that customers without solar will find themselves footing the bill for compensating households with solar.\nThe new rule would make rooftop solar \u201c2024\n\u201c\u201c\nThe third area of concern for advocates is the bill\u2019s proposal to eliminate the public benefits charge from customers\u2019 power bills. That\u2019s a fee that helps pay for energy-efficiency programs, a state clean energy fund, assistance to low-income customers, mandated nuclear power purchases, and other energy-related public policy programs. The legislation would create a Green Bond Fund that would borrow money to pay these costs, removing them from monthly bills and spreading out the financial impact over the bond repayment period.\nMany advocates, however, worry that this approach would result in less certain funding for the energy-efficiency and clean energy programs currently supported by the public benefits charge. As outlined in the legislation, the bond fund would be able to spend up to $800868202312024\nThe bond fund \u201c\nThe Finance, Revenue, and Bonding Committee voted favorably on the bill last week, and it is now expected to\n\u201c\n* Clean energy\n* Nuclear\n* Policy & regulation\n* Solar\n* Northeast\n* Connecticut\nSarah Shemkus is a reporter at Canary Media who is based in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and covers New England.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\nUpvotesNewestOldest\n![](\nGreg Ballantyne\n0 points\n6 months ago\nAny effort that results in a slowdown of building more distributed solar makes energy more expensive.

The Energy Innovation article is fundamentally flawed. The electricity that we consume comes from a variety of sources including merchant power plants and base load generators that have long term PPAs. Most merchant power plants like Merrimack Station in NH rely on forward capacity payments to offset fixed operating costs. Unlike base load plants, these merchant plants only come online when there is demand. During high demand periods, power prices are higher. So the average price for a megawatt generated by a coal plant like Merrimack Station is higher because they only produce when prices are high or ISO New England tells them to run (typically when demand outstrips supply and prices are high). The same would be the case for a wood burning biomass power plant that receives capacity payments. Their average generating cost is higher because they run during peak periods. What this article is actually telling us is that power prices are higher on average when merchant plants are dispatched because there are less merchant plants and more non-dispatchable generators like solar and wind farms. Coal power isn't more expensive because of the cost of coal. It's more expensive because the market supports it. Otherwise, the coal plants wouldn't run.\nThe article also doesn't consider the cost of capacity payments which have increased in recent years to offset the reduction in dispatchable generation. These costs are passed to directly to rate payers. Basically, the subsidies that solar and wind farms receive through tax incentives allow those projects to put cheap power on the grid. However, that power is unreliable. So organized markets like ISO New England charge rate-payers more money per MW to subsidize fossil fuel dispatchable plants to remain available. Retaining more dispatchable generation, whether coal or natural gas or some other fuel, will help keep prices down.\n## read next\n* ![Two people in blue coats and hard hats look at a piece of metal manufacturing equipment ](\nGreen steel\n### Electra announces deals with Meta, Nucor to scale its clean iron tech\n* ![A Pila Mesh Home Battery atop a refrigerator in a home of one of Pila Energy\u2019s friends-and-family testers ](\nBatteries\n### The startup trying to make \u2018DIY\u2019 home batteries happen\n* ![Gray metal boxes lined up with a blue sky overhead ](\nBatteries\n### California has a new law to prevent big grid battery fires\n* ![Aerial shot of a large warehouse complex next to homes ](\nVirtual power plants\n### Can crowdsourcing help solve the data-center power crunch?\n![](",

    "content":"The self-made solar billionaire is forging on with a new U.S. manufacturing business, despite tariff uncertainty and the loss of tax credits.\n![](\nBy Julian Spector\n7 July 2025\n* *\n!Aerial shot of rows of solar panels on grassy field\n(John Touscany via Getty Images)\nDean Solon stands out as one of the very few\nBut a few weeks ago, as he and I found seats outside the Midwest Solar Expo in a far western suburb of Chicago, it was clear the major cashout hadn\u2019t changed his style. Solon, age 61\n\u201c\u201c2017100\nIn fact, Solon\u2019s instinct to tinker and solve problems has thrust him back into the solar manufacturing space at the industry\u2019s most chaotic moment in years.\n\u201c\u201c\nSolon has decided to compete in these dire circumstances by essentially building the entire menu of items needed for a modern solar, battery, or microgrid project, and designing all the pieces to fit together seamlessly. His new firm, Create Energy, will sell developers solar modules, trackers, batteries, inverters, power stations, and other auxiliary equipment. The goal is to save customers time and effort compared to buying separately from a tracker vendor, a module vendor, an inverter vendor, and so on, and then assembling all those components with separate crews.\nIt\u2019s an ominous time to start a new solar manufacturing business in America, to say the least. After a booming few years following the implementation of the 2022\nWhat better moment to check in with one of the most singular voices in the solar industry, who has survived and thrived through the solarcoaster of the last two decades without wavering in his commitment to American manufacturing?\n## U.S. factories can work, but tariffs are complicating the buildout\nSolon\u2019s previous company Shoals originally made automotive parts for Bosch back in the \u201890\nAround that same time, he got an inbound request from a budding solar enterprise that needed some manufactured junction boxes and cable assemblies; that upstart turned out to be First Solar, pretty much the only U.S. panel manufacturer that has excelled over the last few decades (and whose stock has been on a tear as Congress prepared to revoke tax credits for solar projects that use Chinese-made materials).\nOnce he made the jump into solar equipment in the early 2000\n\u201c\u201c\u201870\nThat ethos continues in the new venture. The strategy is to build high-quality equipment and find customers who understand its value, because they\u2019re investing with a longer-term mindset.\n\u201c\u201c\nIn theory, a company with this attitude would welcome tariffs, which raise the cost of cheaply produced competition from Chinese factories. The last few months have seen new tariffs aplenty, though Trump has waived some within days or weeks of announcing them. But while tariffs are often billed as helpful to domestic manufacturers, President Trump\u2019s tariffs are also causing complications for the American factory buildout.\nFor starters, Trump\u2019s blanket tariffs on all Chinese goods impact manufacturing equipment produced in that country. Not only does China make most of the world\u2019s solar panels \u2014 it also makes many of the machines required to manufacture solar.\n\u201c\u201c\n\u201c\nEven if Solon could get his hands on that equipment without exorbitant price hikes, the U.S. lacks enough production of solar cells \u2014 the component that actually converts sunlight into electricity \u2014 to meet the demand for domestic module assembly. Factories that can\u2019t obtain the limited domestic cells need to import them, but the so-called reciprocal tariffs Trump has announced on much of the world, and then delayed, have scrambled the economics for cells from outside the U.S.\nCreate is making other products at its Portland, Tennessee, factory, but the timeline for making solar modules in-house has been pushed back due to the macroeconomic headwinds.\n## To enter the solar market today, deliver big savings\nA decade ago, solar module costs started to plunge, and the price of solar-generated power fell along with it. That has propelled solar to the front of the pack for new power plant construction. But lately the slope of cost declines has leveled off, and incremental module improvements do less and less to push the cost of solar power lower.\nSolon is stepping into that mature marketplace, so he has to bring something new to the table to stand out. After years of making the electrical connectors needed to hook up solar panels into a functioning power plant, he realized he could eliminate several steps for installers with clever design hacks.\nToday\u2019s standard solar-plant construction process creates inefficiencies. \u201c\u2018\nA singular project might have different crews clear the earth, pound the posts, add torque tubes, bolt the modules in place, check the torque on the bolts, handle the electrical work, and then clean up the site, he said.\nThe new products from Create come with electrical connections pre-wired into the modules and the torque tubes of the trackers. Installers can easily snap everything together, at which point, Solon insists, the systems won\u2019t need any more maintenance.\nSolon\u2019s goal was to make installation so easy that it would be doable for an avatar of the modern man that he refers to as \u201c\u201c12\n\u201cAI\u201c\nThat vision would threaten a number of specialized jobs in the solar installation and maintenance business. But it would also deliver more efficient construction, so the same workforce could theoretically deliver more clean power in the same amount of time. If Solon can pull it off, that kind of benefit could be valuable as the industry stares down the loss of its decades-long tax-credit regime.\n## The solar industry is in for a period of pain, so stability matters\nSolon doesn\u2019t deny that the solar industry writ large is heading for a contraction, but he rejects the more apocalyptic outlooks some fear for the sector. Instead, he thinks it\u2019ll be a reset for the industry after the bounty of Biden-era policy supercharged the pace of activity.\n\u201c\u201c\nThe wave of bankruptcies has already begun, taking down longtime industry stalwarts like solar loan provider Mosaic, rooftop solar financier Sunnova, grid-battery integrator Powin Energy, and more.\nIt\u2019s not a bad time to have a billion dollars in the bank and several decades of manufacturing experience.\n\u201c\u201c20304050\n\u201cIPO\u201c\n* Solar\n* Clean energy manufacturing\nJulian Spector is a senior reporter at Canary Media.

Earlier this year, Duke University researcher Tyler Norris made waves in the AI-energy world with\nThe Aligned battery offers a concrete example of that kind of research. The utility studied just how big the battery would need to be to compensate for challenges imposed on the local grid by the data center. Aligned and Calibrant had their own calculations, Martin said, \u201c\nDue to the local nature of the power constraint, the battery had to be built close to Aligned\u2019s facility; the company ultimately provided the land to host the grid storage installation. In other cases, where a proposed data center runs up against a system-wide capacity constraint, a battery solution could be further away.\nAnother glimpse of the battery-enabled future came this summer when Redwood Materials, a richly funded battery-recycling startup, unveiled a new business line that repackages old EV to serve data-center demand. The first installation, at Redwood\u2019s campus near Reno, Nevada, fully powered a very small, modular data center using a solar array and a field of former EV\nRedwood just got its own vote of confidence in that concept: On Thursday, it\n## Business model protects other utility customers\nAligned\u2019s commitment to paying for the battery itself could serve as a model of socially responsible AI-infrastructure development.\nSome utilities around the country are jumping to build new power plants to support the projected data-center buildout, and charging their regular customers for the investment, hoping the AIAI\nBecause Aligned is footing the bill, the utility\u2019s other customers won\u2019t be forced to pay for the data-center firm\u2019s growth ambitions. But, though this one large customer will provide the land and funding, the battery will sit on the utility side of the meter. That means the utility can leverage the tech for other grid uses, like frequency management and capacity, when it\u2019s not maintaining the flow of power to the data center during otherwise scarce hours.\nIn this case, Martin said, the permitting and buildout could move faster with the battery connecting to the utility grid instead of directly to the data center. In other situations, bigger batteries on the customer side of the meter might make more sense.

Across the country, utility bills are rising, and the budget bill and other Trump administration actions impeding clean energy development are expected to drive the price of energy up further.\nMost households that install rooftop solar\nBut without these tax credits, installing rooftop solar will be significantly more expensive \u2014 putting it out of reach for many, especially the lower-income residents who stand to benefit the most. It would take the average homeowner five or six years longer to break even on their solar system if incentives disappear, per Ohm Analytics.\nThe tax-credit repeal would be only the latest blow to residential solar in the U.S., 68\nThat same year, California, the country\u2019s largest residential solar market, slashed the amount of money households can earn from selling solar power back to the grid, eroding the economics of solar as a result. High interest rates over the last few years have also hampered installations because most buyers finance solar panels. In recent weeks, two major national rooftop-solar firms have gone bankrupt due to a combination of these factors and the new uncertainty over the tax credits.\nIt remains unclear what the final outcome for the tax credits will be. On Monday, the Senate Finance Committee released\nIf the tax credits are indeed repealed or significantly reduced, it would be a major setback not only for energy affordability and for the U.S. residential solar industry that\n* Solar\n* Policy & regulation\n* Politics\nDan McCarthy is a senior editor at Canary Media.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\nUpvotesNewestOldest\nJ\nJim Lazar\n1 point\n4 months ago\nInfant industry subsidies are supposed to go away eventually. If, as the article suggests, homeowners can still recover their investment in 5-6 years without the credits, perhaps it is time for these credits to fade away.\nIn the years since the 30% solar ITC was originally adopted, a decade ago, the cost of solar has dropped by much more than 30%. So the economics today, without a tax credit, are better than they were a decade ago with the tax credit.\nOf course, the flip side of the tax credits COULD BE a national carbon tax or cap and trade system. That would help pay down the deficit, and have the same effect on solar affordability as a tax credit. This Congress and this President are not likely to pursue this obvious solution. But the next one might.\nJ\nJosh\n0 points\n4 months ago\nThe article said it could take \"five or six years longer to break even...\", not 5-6 years total. It will be 10+ years payback period for most homeowners unless the cost of energy is extremely high or you can install yourself. Also it doesn't seem logical to phase out renewable incentives while leaving massive subsidies for the oil & gas industry. This is all backwards. But I do think solar has gotten cheap enough that it can be competitive especially when interest rates come down.\nD\nDwight L Johnson\n0 points\n4 months ago\nThe loss of these credits will be a grieous opportunity lost.

However, it may be counterintuitive but it could actual turn out to help advance solar in the long run. DER Solar is on par cost wise with other generation sources. The drawback is its subsidies. This BBB action means DER solar can stand out as a generation source installed without federal subsidies unlike nuclear and fossil fuels. Just flip the tables on federal subsidies. Today with the ITC DER solar SPBs are around 7 years and this will push that back up to 10+ year. The industry has lived in the past with a SPB around 10 years when costs were $12 to $18 a watt installed and had grown. The industry needs to refocus on DER solar benefits - you make your own fuel to power your EV and heat pump lowering your costs. It can lower the load on the distribution system if paired with battery storage under FERC Order 2222. DER Solar can lower supply costs by reducing the need for supply side generation, transmission and ancillary services without federal subsidies. And if DER Solar can do this let's end all direct and indirect energy subsidies and than lets see who can actually compete. Hope for the best - keeping the ITC but prepare for the worse. Just a thought\nB\nBrandon Deno\n0 points\n4 months ago\nThink of those \"solar industry colleagues\" in your LinkedIn feed that you know voted for this... They are forever on my personal blacklist.

The developer currently has dozens of community solar projects operating in Illinois, too. (\nCommunity solar has thrived in Illinois, thanks to clean-energy laws passed by state legislators in 20162021sent to an early grave by the GOP\nThe beauty of community solar is that it allows anyone, even those who can\u2019t put photovoltaic panels on their own properties, to access solar energy via subscriptions to a larger array sited elsewhere. Until congressional Republicans passed their budget law this summer, the companies building community solar could tap federal tax credits into the 203020262027\nBefore any power-generating project can connect to the grid, it needs to undergo a lengthy review. Utilities must determine the project\u2019s viability and the cost of grid upgrades that it might require, which the developer usually pays for and needs to know ahead of time to secure financing. Though the process is notorious for taking too long, the actual length of time a proposal spends in this interconnection queue can vary greatly depending on the utility.\nAdvocates are calling out Ameren, which serves central and southern Illinois, for taking longer than the norm. One major reason is that the utility only studies community solar applications one at a time. At that rate, it takes years or even decades for proposals to be reviewed and ready for construction.\nBy contrast, ComEd, the utility that serves northern Illinois, reviews multiple project proposals concurrently and \u201c\nAmeren currently has over 1700\nThe utility is moving toward studying proposals concurrently, like ComEd does, but the policy won\u2019t be fully in place until January 2027\n\u201c\u201c\n## How can utilities speed up the interconnection queue?\nIllinois currently ranks among the top five states for community solar capacity. Illinois lawmakers kick-started this development in 2016\nAbout 768\nComEd now has about 200430MW202544275080\nEven with the glut of applications, ComEd said it has managed to complete interconnection studies and agreements in a timely fashion, in part because it studies projects concurrently.\nDevelopers agree with that assessment.

To avoid this unnecessary use of resources, Love said Ameren is \u201c\nThe utility is \u201c\nThis means that Ameren \u201c\nCollingsworth said that more information and transparency from the utility make developers\u2019 jobs easier, since they know which proposals to prioritize.\nLove said Ameren has made maps and queue reports more user-friendly, so that developers will have a better idea of which projects are worth pursuing. The utility is also offering companies \u201c\nWhile delays have not been a major problem in ComEd territory, according to developers, the utility has also taken steps to reduce interconnection wait times. It is allowing the use of a letter of credit or escrow account instead of cash as the deposit needed before construction can begin, and it is connecting developers seeking to do projects on the same part of the grid, so they can potentially collaborate to reduce costs.\n## State lawmakers look to ease interconnection\nA\nThe state\u2019s 2021\u201c\nWhile the bill\u2019s passage likely wouldn\u2019t help projects meet the July 2026create a virtual power plant program, providing extra revenue to battery-equipped community solar projects that send power to the grid at times of peak demand.\nProfessionals in the solar industry said that the impending loss of federal tax credits underscores the importance of such state-level programs and policies.\n\u201c40\nAndrew Linhares, who leads Midwest policy work for the Solar Energy Industries Association, echoed Theisen\u2019s sentiment. \u201c\n* Solar\n* Policy & regulation\n* Utilities\n* Midwest\n* Illinois\nKari Lydersen is a contributing reporter at Canary Media who covers Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\n## read next\n* ![Gray metal boxes lined up with a blue sky overhead ](\nBatteries\n### California has a new law to prevent big grid battery fires\n* ![Aerial shot of a large warehouse complex next to homes ](\nVirtual power plants\n### Can crowdsourcing help solve the data-center power crunch?\n* ![A large ship with cargo at a port ](\nMarine transport\n### Global rules to decarbonize ships delayed amid Trump\u2019s pushback\n* ![ ](\nPolitics\n### The DOE\u2019s loan office enters its \u2018energy dominance\u2019 era\n![](",

(Ben McCanna\/Portland Press Herald via Getty Images)\nMaine\u2019s solar incentive program has become a political scapegoat for rising electricity prices in the state, but clean-energy advocates say the numbers don\u2019t add up.\nMaine utility customers pay some of the country\u2019s highest electricity prices, but the portion of their monthly bills that goes toward buying surplus power from neighbors\u2019 solar panels has actually decreased in recent months, according to one analysis.\nMeanwhile, the amount of money utilities are paying for power from fossil fuel\u2013fired plants and transmission represents a far bigger share of the electricity-bill bottom line.\n\u201c\u2018\u201c\nMaine Republican lawmakers this session have introduced four different bills calling for the repeal of net energy billing, the system that compensates utility customers for unused electricity they generate and share on the grid. Supporters of the bills have called the program\n\u201c\u201c\nThe hostility toward Maine\u2019s net energy billing rules is part of a wave of efforts to blame rising power prices on clean-energy and energy-efficiency programs, particularly in New England. In Rhode Island and Maryland, legislators have called for cuts to fees supporting energy-efficiency and clean-energy programs. And Massachusetts regulators last week ordered $500\nAt a legislative committee hearing last week, Maine legislators testified that small-business owners will be forced to close their doors and low-income households put in dire financial straits by wealthy solar-panel owners imposing the cost of their renewable-energy choices onto everyone else. It is \u201c\u201c\n## Looking at the evidence\nThe numbers tell a very different story, beginning with the actual dollars-and-cents impact of net energy billing on the average consumer.\nMaine\u2019s net energy billing program was expanded in 201920241500MW100MW2019\nStatewide, costs attributed to net energy billing now make up a slightly smaller percentage of the average bill than they did in the latter half of 2024500640762706\nSo if it\u2019s not the solar program, then what is causing utility bills to rise? One of the main forces driving electricity prices is the cost of energy supply in New England, more than half of which comes from natural gas\u2013fired power plants. Volatility in the natural gas market, therefore, translates directly into higher electricity rates for consumers. Prices spiked in 2022202339\n\u201c\nThe other major contributor is rising transmission costs, which on average make up 51372023\nThere are some commercial cases in which the cost for net energy billing does have an outsized impact on energy bills, supporters of the incentive agree. Commercial power customers are charged a fixed rate based on the specific rate classification their business falls under. This system means some businesses end up with a much larger percentage of their bill paying for net energy billing.\nAt last week\u2019s hearing, Sen. Stewart testified that potato processor Penobscot McCrum will pay close to $70000055\nSupporters of net energy billing agree that situations such as these are unfair and unsustainable, and a docket is already underway with the state Public Utilities Commission to address that specific issue without repealing the entire net energy billing program, Donoghue said.\n\u201c\n## Unseen savings\nNet energy billing also provides benefits that are hard to see but which offset the costs, supporters said. In 2023130160\u201c\nMore solar generation in the state means more Maine households are getting power produced in or near their communities, lowering the strain on the transmission and distribution systems \u2014 and the associated costs. Solar developers also pay for any infrastructure upgrades needed to accommodate their projects.\n\u201c\nFurthermore, eliminating net energy billing would have its own financial consequences for the roughly 110000\nOpponents in the legislature have passed three rounds of rollbacks to the program.

Phil Scott, right, is pushing for a bill that would undo some of the state's climate and clean energy policies. (Suzanne Kreiter\/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)\nVermont clean energy advocates are playing defense this year in Montpelier.\nThe Green Mountain State has long been a leader on clean energy, generating nearly all of its electricity from renewable sources since 2015\n\u201c\nA new crop of Republican state lawmakers is taking aim at clean energy policy in the state, and while most of their bills are unlikely to pass in the Democratic-controlled Legislature, those backed by Republican Gov. Phil Scott are expected to get committee hearings. Meanwhile, Democrats have lost their legislative supermajorities, which means any legislation they pass will be vulnerable to a veto.\nGov. Scott, who stood up for climate action during the first Trump presidency, is striking a newly skeptical tone about the cost of clean energy programs and has announced his intent to roll back some provisions of state climate laws. As a backdrop to it all are growing concerns about energy price inflation that has caused some to falsely blame climate and clean energy policy for rising utility bills.\n\u201c\n## Vermont Republicans look to delay, roll back climate policy\nVermont was one of the first states to pass a \u201c\nWhile the state\u2019s electricity supply is largely decarbonized, the transportation and heating sectors are still responsible for 70\nThe Vermont Global Warming Solutions Act, passed in 2020402030199020502021\nThe plan maps out decarbonization strategies including encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles, reducing the number of vehicle miles traveled by promoting development of compact communities, reducing the use of fossil fuels to heat buildings, and expanding weatherization services.\nScott vetoed the Global Warming Solutions Act, but the Legislature overrode his decision by sizable margins. Now, Scott wants to undo some of the law by pushing\nThe bill would replace the state\u2019s renewable energy requirements with a clean electricity standard that includes nuclear power. Advocates worry the change would shift money from solar and wind to nuclear projects. The bill would also reapportion efficiency funds \u2014 which now pay for a range of services including home energy assessments, commercial lighting support, and financing programs \u2013 to support weatherization, a narrower focus which advocates say would not have as much impact on greenhouse gas reductions as the broader array of options.\nThe bill would remove the Climate Council\u2019s authority to direct policy, making its role merely advisory. The legislation would then create a separate body tasked with developing its own \u201c2026\n\u201c\u201818\n## To avoid Gov. Scott\u2019s veto pen, Democrats seek budget-neutral solutions\nAt the same time, Democrats \u2014 aware of Scott\u2019s resistance to any clean energy action that comes with a price tag \u2014 have proposed just one major energy bill.\n\u201c\nDemocrats\u2019 proposal would expand the mission of the state\u2019s energy-efficiency utility, Efficiency Vermont, to include a broader range of emission-reducing and cost-saving solutions, including fuel switching and electric vehicle adoption.

Buddy Carter, the Republican congressman for Georgia\u2019s 1st4\nJulian Spector:\nIt\u2019s an honor to have you here. We\u2019re just kicking off our first live event in Washington, D.C. Everyone is into the energy scene \u2014 the technologies and the policies. I wanted to start by saying why we were so excited to have you here. You\u2019re the Republican congressman from Georgia\u2019s 1st\nBuddy Carter:31\nSpector:8EV\nCarter: 76\nAs I say, $768500\nSpector: 59\nI\u2019m from D.C., and I ended up going to college down in the South. (Go Blue Devils, figure that one out.) But sometimes, I think D.C. folks, we don\u2019t always keep up with all the things happening in the South. There\u2019s really a cluster of innovation and factories there. I was wondering if you could say, what has clean energy meant to the economy of Georgia, both in the manufacturing side and the installation of solar and battery projects?\nCarter: 7\nI also would be remiss if I did not mention the fact that Georgia is the first state to have nuclear reactors in the last 30\nI\u2019m a nuclear fan. Plant Vogtle is the largest clean energy plant in the United States. We added two reactors, reactors 3433\nSpector: 1819\nCarter: AP1000\nWe look forward to that because nuclear power is a big part of what we\u2019re doing. We also have battery plants in the state of Georgia.\nGeorgia, for 111\nNow let\u2019s talk about affordability, because I think that\u2019s an important thing to talk about as well. Yes, nuclear power is more expensive at this point, but I think it\u2019s important to note that the difference between the cost of reactor No. 34\nWe learned a lot of things when we built reactor No. 34\nSpector:\nSpeaking of the cost of energy, I think we can\u2019t ignore there\u2019s a little something going on in Washington this week, which is this big, beautiful budget. I was looking back over a letter you wrote with some of your colleagues from the Conservative Climate Caucus last summer, basically saying that prematurely repealing the energy tax credits, particularly those used to justify investments that already broke ground, could undermine private investment and stop development that\u2019s already ongoing. And I think that applies both to factories that are trying to make things in America, and power plants, solar plants.\nSo, you voted for the budget bill. What happened between the argument you were making in that letter last summer and the bill that you ultimately voted for?\nCarter:\nIn fact, I\u2019ve signed three letters saying that we should not take a sledgehammer to the Inflation Reduction Act. Instead, we should take a scalpel, because I\u2019ve always said, and I continue to say, if these policies result in stabilizing our supply chain or if they result in domestic manufacturing, why wouldn\u2019t we look at them? Why wouldn\u2019t we keep them? That\u2019s Republican priorities anyway.\nI want to share a quick story with you because I thought it was somewhat humorous. I was calling up a supporter. And, you know, I\u2019m running statewide. I should have mentioned that I\u2019m running for U.S. Senate in the next election.\nI called up a potential supporter, and he was saying, \u201cIRA\nAnd I said, \u201c\nHe responded: \u201cIRA\nGive me a break. Republican ideas, Democratic ideas. We do it all the time \u2014 we take things that the Democrats did, we claim them to be ours, and they do the same thing. They\u2019re good ideas, and I think it\u2019s important to note that. Some of these things did result in stabilizing the supply chain and in domestic manufacturing. Why wouldn\u2019t we keep those things? Why wouldn\u2019t we look at that? The Republicans want that just as much as the Democrats.\nNow, having said that, let me make one thing clear: The decision to make the $76\nNow, would they like to have the tax credits? Of course they would; any business would. But I think it is significant that we understand that decision was made. Let me assure you, as I have assured them, they made a wise decision. There\u2019s going to be a market for EVs.\nI\u2019m one who strongly believes that the government shouldn\u2019t be choosing winners and losers, because when the government chooses winners and losers, consumers lose. There\u2019s going to be a market for EVs. It may not be in rural South Georgia, but eventually it will. I can assure you, in the urban areas, Hyundai is going to do great.\nSpector:\nCarter:\nI think it ought to be market-driven. I don\u2019t think the government should be telling people what kind of car to be driving or what kind of appliance you\u2019re going to be using. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the role of the government.\nSpector:\nCarter:\nThe main thing is we\u2019ve got to get these tax cuts extended. We have to make sure that we don\u2019t have the largest tax increase in the history of the world.\nWe have companies coming into our office every day. They need stability. They need certainty in order to make investments. I understand that \u2014 I was in business for myself for 32\nThe government\u2019s been run in the past few decades by executive orders. We\u2019ve got to get away from that. Whether you\u2019re Republican or Democrat, you ought to feel, if you\u2019re a member of Congress, that the legislative branch has got to assert themselves and their authority as our forefathers intended for it to be.\nI am trying to encourage some of these senators and, even still, some House members, because it\u2019s going to come back to us.\nI\u2019m not going to mislead you. It\u2019s a heavy lift. I think the biggest hurdle we\u2019re trying to get over is in the Senate, and some of those who, first of all, feel like, you know, we didn\u2019t address the debt. That\u2019s not what we were doing this for. Does it need to be addressed? Obviously. I\u2019m on the budget committee. Obviously it needs to be addressed. And don\u2019t think that we can\u2019t do another reconciliation package. We can do another one, and I would submit to you that we need to do a budget reconciliation package for debt reduction.\nI\u2019m chair of the health subcommittee. I\u2019m a pharmacist by profession. Medicaid, Medicare \u2014 we need reforms in that, but not here. Keep the main thing the main thing, and the main thing is to get these tax cuts extended, because if we don\u2019t, the impact it\u2019s going to have on our economy is going to be devastating.\nSpector: AI\nAfter decades of pretty much flat demand for electricity, we\u2019re now seeing pretty mind-blowing expectations of how much is going to be needed in the next few years. Solar is the thing that\u2019s getting built the most across the country right now, and if the credits sort of shake up the investment landscape there, they\u2019re saying it could jeopardize 60\nDo you think your colleagues are grappling with that, a possibility that these cuts might actually undermine the president\u2019s AI\nCarter: AIAIAIAI\nWe understand now, to your point, the demand for energy. That\u2019s why I\u2019m an all-of-the-above type energy strategist, because we are going to need every electron we can get. We all know how much data centers in AI\nTo your point, yes, we\u2019re going to need solar, we\u2019re going to need wind, we\u2019re going to need nuclear and its baseload reliability. Yes, we\u2019re going to need it. We\u2019re going to need every available electron.\nAll of you understand how important this is. We cannot afford to lose this race to China. We cannot afford to lose the AI\nSpector: AI\nCarter:\nWe had this tragedy in Fukushima, and I was able to go to Japan and see what happened there. Europe\u2019s kind of abandoned nuclear energy, but I think they\u2019re going back now. I know France, thank goodness, didn\u2019t abandon it; they\u2019re providing it for everyone. Nuclear is going to be a big part of it. We\u2019re going to need everything. I am encouraging my colleagues to look at everything.\nSpector:\nCarter:\nI have the honor and privilege of representing, as I said, the coast of Georgia. It\u2019s where I\u2019ve lived all my life and where I intend to live the rest of my life. Some of my fondest memories growing up are going fishing with my dad. I want my sons, I want my grandchildren, to have that same opportunity to enjoy those memories.\nI love the environment. I\u2019m not going to ever do anything intentionally to hurt the environment. I tell you, environmentalists are tough \u2014 you can be with 99901\nMy point is, it is important for us as Republicans to acknowledge, and I do believe. I believe in climate change. I believe that man has an impact on the climate and that we need to address it.\nI believe that we should be looking toward cleaner energy and renewable energy. I do believe that. That\u2019s why I\u2019m cochair of the Conservative Climate Caucus. That\u2019s why I work. That\u2019s why I signed those three letters. That\u2019s why I\u2019m working diligently on this. I want us to do that, but at the same time, we\u2019ve got to be careful not to cut our nose off in spite of our face. It needs to be an approach that is sensible and logical.\nSpector:\nCarter:\nI\u2019ll give you an example. I think this is relevant. As I said, I represent the city of Savannah. The Savannah Harbor expansion project, where we deepened our harbor from 42472022\nThe permitting \u2014 this is true \u2014 the permitting for that project started in 1996\nIn that period of time, China has started and completed three new ports.

Solar and energy-storage industries are backing another bill that includes even more ambitious goals for building out new transmission and energy storage.\nThere\u2019s widespread agreement that Illinois\u2019 current grid is not ready for the state\u2019s mandated transition to 1002050proliferation of data centers in Illinois.\nCRGA73\n\u201c\nThe industry-backed transmission and storage bill (715GW24203GW1\nStakeholders generally agree that new energy legislation is especially crucial given the Trump administration\u2019s rollbacks to clean energy incentives and mandates.\n\u201c\n## Study first\nIllinois does not do the type of comprehensive planning for energy use and transmission that electric utilities do in states with vertically integrated energy markets. In Illinois, separate companies generate and transmit electricity, with the idea that the open market will match supply with demand. But experts say centralized planning is necessary to ensure that clean energy can meet the state\u2019s needs.\n\u201c\nCRGA\nThe bill also mandates public studies of the grid to determine where it is underutilized and how the latest technology could more efficiently move electrons around \u2014 increasing the grid\u2019s capacity without building new wires.\n\u201c\n\u201c\u201c\n\u201c\u201c\n## Transmission, storage, and efficiency\nLast year, companies hoping to build new high-voltage transmission in Illinois backed a proposal for creating renewable energy credits to incentivize it, similar to those that helped Illinois grow its solar capacity manyfold to\nCRGA\nThis could help the company 350underground transmission cable connecting Iowa and Illinois.

That smashes 202321\nTo be sure, the data comes with a notable caveat. Heat pumps outsold gas furnaces, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean more households are choosing heat pumps over gas heating; homes often need multiple heat-pump units to replace a single fossil fuel\u2013fired appliance.\nStill, heat pumps have clear momentum. In fact, the market has been RMI\u201c\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why. Electric heat pumps have massive comfort, climate, and health benefits. They\u2019re essentially two-way air conditioners that can both heat and cool building interiors, are routinely three to four times as efficient as fossil-fuel systems, and are one of the most effective ways an individual can reduce their planet-warming pollution.

Contractors are also apt to move cautiously because they want to be sure that a technology will work for their business model before committing to it.\nA medley of factors are causing heat pump sales to grow, according to experts Canary Media spoke to. Firstly, consumers and contractors are gaining more familiarity with the tech and having better experiences, Unger said.\nAdvances in heat pump technology have made it well-suited to some of the coldest climes in the U.S. Just look to Maine; heat pumps proved so popular there that the wintry state blew past its 2025can work well below -22.

Installation costs for these systems are on average\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, the most ambitious climate legislation in history, gave Americans state-distributed home energy rebates of up to $8000how long these incentives might last under the Trump administration is an open question.\nThanks to steady growth in heat pump sales thus far, the U.S. is now among the top countries quickly transitioning from oil and gas heating to heat pumps, said\nWhat will it take to drive heat pump sales even higher in the U.S.?

(Courtesy of Dominion Energy)\nAn army of conservative think tanks are lobbying for a stop-work order on U.S. offshore wind installations that are already under construction along the East Coast. But one of those groups is breaking ranks, refusing to endorse the demise of America\u2019s largest project, off the Virginia coast.\nThe dissent reveals a chink in the armor of Republican opposition to wind, which has grown dramatically since President Donald Trump\u2019s return to office.\nAt the heart of the disagreement is Dominion Energy\u2019s 26781766\nUnder a hypothetical cancellation, the residents of Virginia could potentially have to pay for that abandoned investment in the form of higher utility bills, without getting anything in return.\n\u201c\u201c2025\n\u201c\u201c\nHaner felt compelled to speak up about the economic fallout that would result from killing Dominion\u2019s project after a group of GOP\u201c\nHaner declined to join the petition and explained why in\n\u201c\u201c\n\u201c11\u201c\nThe letter was signed by a half dozen conservation groups known for their far-right policy agendas, including the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, the Heartland Institute, the John Locke Foundation, and the Caesar Rodney Institute. A few anti-wind advocacy groups also signed on, including Green Oceans and REACT\nSome of the think tanks, like the Delaware-based Caesar Rodney Institute, have ties to existing lawsuits aimed at stopping various offshore wind projects. Those complaints, filed against the federal government, contain similar claims found in Tuesday\u2019s letter about \u201c\nNone of these lawsuits led by GOP\nHaner said that the Thomas Jefferson Institute declined to participate in those lawsuits.\n\u201c\u201c\nBesides, he added, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, endorses the Dominion project, too.\nThe Thomas Jefferson Institute has previously aligned with the Caesar Rodney Institute on anti-wind lobbying and has teamed up with other members of the conservation coalition known as the State Policy Network, which promotes far-right policies favored by Trump.\n\u201c\nStevenson believes that the federal government could somehow reimburse ratepayers for any sunk costs left by a federally mandated cancellation of projects. There\u2019s little precedent for such an outcome. In fact, historically, ratepayers have had to bear the financial burden when a project goes awry.\nFor example, South Carolina residents are still paying for a nuclear power plant that was never completed. Construction on the infamous V.C. Summer nuclear project ceased in 20179\nHaner used to hate the idea of offshore wind coming to his home state. The high upfront costs of construction made little sense to him. For many years, he used his think-tank leverage to try and prevent the industry from gaining a foothold.

(Chris Wingard\/U.S. Department of Energy)\nA first-of-its-kind pilot to electrify homes on Cape Cod and Martha\u2019s Vineyard is set to finish construction in the coming weeks \u2014 and it could offer a blueprint for decarbonizing low- and moderate-income households in Massachusetts and beyond.\nThe Cape and Vineyard Electrification Offering is designed to be a turnkey program that makes it financially feasible and logistically approachable for households of all income levels to adopt solar panels, heat pumps, and batteries, and to realize the amplified benefits of using the resources together. These technologies slash emissions, reduce utility bills, and increase a home\u2019s resilience during power outages, but are often only adopted by wealthier households due to their upfront cost.\n\u201c\nIn total, the program is providing free or heavily subsidized solar panels and heat pumps to 5512\n\u201c\u201c\nIt\u2019s a strategy that program planners hope can help address the disproportionate energy burden felt by lower-income residents of the region, where households making less than one-third of the area median income spent an average of 272023\nThe initiative is a project of the Cape Light Compact, a unique regional organization that negotiates electric supply prices and administers energy-efficiency programming for the 212018202020212023the green light.\nAn energy-efficiency contractor partners with each program participant to assess their home, then coordinates the necessary work, including any preparations that need to be completed before solar panels, heat pumps, or batteries can be put in. The batteries installed through the program are enrolled in ConnectedSolutions, a state program that pays battery owners who send power to the grid when needed. Because the pilot footed the bill for the batteries, these payments will go to the Cape Light Compact, rather than residents, to help defray the cost of the program.\nBringing the program to life was not always a smooth process.

A whole town, or city, quite another. Is it costing the folks footing the bill (not the home owners), $10,000 a home, $50K a home, or a whole lot more. Also what has been the timeframe from contact with the home owner and completion of the job. As the article points out, each home may have different issues - no basements, old electrical panels and wiring roofs needing reinforcement, or just repairs. How much time does it take from start to completion - a range, covering all 55 homes? Is this another super expensive project that governments have to pay for, or is there a reasonable cost basis to this.\nI note that these homes are selling their electric to the utility. But as we see in most states with big solar pushes to put solar on roofs, ie CA, after a while the utilities can no longer afford to pay retail rates to homes providing electric back at peak times. That's why in CA new solar installations are falling off a cliff while existing home owners with solar are adding batteries (a good thing). Still, while we are upgrading a few homes, the norm because the utility is paying far more for residential electric buys than wholesale electric from power plants, etc, increases the share of the utility bill paid for by folks that can't afford solar, et al.\nA follow up article that answers some of these questions would make this program something to consider, or abandon, but without details it just sounds like another experiment, more likely than not, to fail, due to costs.\nSo how about a good follow up piece? thanks\n## read next\n* ![A Pila Mesh Home Battery atop a refrigerator in a home of one of Pila Energy\u2019s friends-and-family testers ](\nBatteries\n### The startup trying to make \u2018DIY\u2019 home batteries happen\n* ![Gray metal boxes lined up with a blue sky overhead ](\nBatteries\n### California has a new law to prevent big grid battery fires\n* ![Aerial shot of a large warehouse complex next to homes ](\nVirtual power plants\n### Can crowdsourcing help solve the data-center power crunch?\n* ![A large ship with cargo at a port ](\nMarine transport\n### Global rules to decarbonize ships delayed amid Trump\u2019s pushback\n![](",

Greg Abbott and other Republican leaders were quick to blame trouble with wind and solar power generation for the power outages. While renewables did struggle to generate electricity in the frigid temperatures, so did natural gas power generation after power plant equipment and some pipelines that supply gas to the plants froze.\nAfter that disaster, lawmakers argued that the state needed more on-demand power \u2014 specifically natural gas power plants \u2014 that doesn\u2019t require wind and sun to generate electricity. They started the Texas Energy Fund with an initial $5528\nBut since 2023\nEnergy demand is rising globally due to the construction of new data centers for artificial intelligence, and many regions are turning to natural gas power because of its relative affordability, lower emissions compared to coal, and its ability to operate at all times of the day, unlike wind and solar.\nThat demand is straining the supply chain for turbines, specialized equipment used in power plants that cost tens of millions of dollars. Wait times on orders for the machinery have\nA turbine order placed today likely would not arrive before 2029\nAt the same time, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the state\u2019s power grid operator, is predicting energy demand in the state will double by 2030AI\nThe state is on course to meet those electricity demands, but largely through advancements in solar technology and battery storage, which are significantly cheaper than natural gas power plants to install. In Texas\u2019 deregulated energy market, which gives preference to the least-expensive power, this takes away the forecast market share available to companies hoping to profit from a new natural gas power plant, meaning the plants cost more to install and are likely to make less money over time, said Dennis Wamsted, an energy analyst with the nonprofit Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\n\u201c\u201c\nLegislators this spring have responded by extending the deadline for spending the $52023PUC2268PUC\u201c\n\u201cTEF\n## **PUC**\nThe PUC1515\nState Rep.

Canary Media went on-site to see how one startup aims to achieve that using electromagnetic beams.\n![](\nBy Julian Spector\n13 March 2025\n* *\n![](\nStartup Quaise began yard tests of its rock-melting energy beam in January, clearing the way for field tests that will dig into the earth. (Quaise)\nOne recent day in a warehouse south of downtown Houston, I got a peek at something that just might revolutionize the clean energy transition: a molten orange puddle of instantly liquefied rock.\nMoments before, an attendant loaded a slug of basalt under a metal-frame structure that looked like something a supervillain might point at a tied-up James Bond, and I was ushered behind a protective barrier. An order went out, the contraption began to whir, and we turned our focus to a TV\nOne mustn\u2019t believe everything that appears on a screen, but then Carlos Araque, CEO2000\nThe flashy demonstration was just one example of how startups are looking to revolutionize geothermal energy production. The U.S. built its 1960044solar and battery capacity Texas installs in four months these days.\nThe way out of this decades-long malaise may simply be down. The more subterranean heat a geothermal plant can access, the more energy it can generate, and the Earth gets hotter closer to the core. But the intense conditions below a few miles deep rapidly wreck conventional drill bits.\nAraque figured that if he could build a strong enough drill bit, it could harness this super-deep heat and deliver cheap, clean, and abundant geothermal power, pretty much anywhere.\nSo he left a career in oilfield drilling and formed Quaise in 2018\n![](\nAn early test shows the glassy obsidian that solidifies after the Quaise millimeter-wave beam melts a hole in a basalt slab. (Julian Spector)\nAraque likened the technology to the familiar microwave oven, which heats food by zapping it with a particular band of electromagnetic waves that excites water molecules.\n\u201c\u201c\nHe first pitched me on his super-powered drill bit six years ago. At the time, it all sounded like science fiction, something that Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers might study and venture capitalists might take a flyer on but that wouldn\u2019t materialize as real technology.\nIn fact, Quaise did spin out of an MIT100\nStill, Quaise has plenty more work to do before it can deliver its transformative promise \u2014 and that starts with getting out of the lab and into the field.\n## Field tests of rock-melting beam to begin in Houston and Austin, Texas\nBy the time I visited in late January, Quaise had been melting rock outside of the lab but on its own property for weeks. I personally witnessed rock-melting in two places: in the hangar, with a drill rig pointing the millimeter-wave beam at a target rock, and in the yard, where a contraption mounted on tank treads blasted into a rock sample placed in a concrete receptacle on the ground.\n\u201c\nThese tests are necessary to calibrate the novel combination of millimeter-wave emitter and conventional oil-drilling rig. (The Quaise founders know their way around that world, having come from drilling powerhouse Schlumberger.) Quaise proved it can transmit the waves while moving the device, something that the nuclear fusion folks never needed to test. The company\u2019s \u201c\n![]( Canary Media's Julian Spector conferred with Quaise CEO Carlos Araque on the grounds of Quaise's Houston facility. (Lisa Hymas)\nThe tests so far amount to the karate demonstration where someone chops through a stack of two-by-fours: Most impressive but not a commercially viable way to chop wood. The next step is obvious \u2014 Quaise needs to get out and drill into the earth. That\u2019s coming soon.\nQuaise obtained a test site in north Houston where it can drill up to 100100182\nSoon after, Quaise will swap that out for a new 1108\nDrilling 100500\u201cBYOG\n\u201c\u201c\n## New geothermal power plants coming soon\nIf and when the time comes to drill for actual power plants, Quaise aims to ride conventional drilling technologies as far as they\u2019ll go. The plan is to hire traditional rigs to burrow through the first 232\nAfter hitting basement rock, Quaise will swap drill bits for its millimeter-wave drill and blast to about 5\nQuaise leaders did not disclose a timeline for the company\u2019s first commercial deep drilling. At that point, Quaise will need to build an actual power plant and navigate the myriad permitting and transmission-connection hurdles that face renewables developers broadly. The company is running this development process in-house and already has multiple geothermal leases secured, a spokesperson noted.\nIn the meantime, a handful of other startups are making headway on commercial-scale geothermal plants, albeit with different approaches.\nFervo Energy has applied fracking technologies to geothermal drilling to make the process more efficient; after a successful 35 in Nevada, the company began drilling the 400\nCloser in principle to Quaise, a Canadian startup called Eavor is developing ways to drill deeper than was economically practical before. Instead of reinventing the drill itself, Eavor defends it with insulation and \u201c\n\u201c180 temperatures, [but Eavor\u2019s] insulated drilling pipe has a cooling effect on the tools making them work at even higher temperatures just by insulating the pipe,\u201d a company spokesperson said in an email.\nEavor notched a big win in 2023342508264\nTaken together, geothermal innovators like Quaise, along with the somewhat less science-fictiony enhanced geothermal startups like Fervo and Eavor, could produce the \u201c\n\u201c\u201c\nQuaise could in theory supply those other geothermal innovators with a better type of drill to extend their range. But Araque insisted Quaise wants to be in the power generation business, not the widget business.\nThe company also has to manage an evident chokepoint in its development: those highly specialized gyrotrons. Quaise owns four, Araque said; the global gyrotron supply chain currently can\u2019t handle an order for 10\nThe work to extend from boring a few inches of rock to miles of it should not be underestimated, but Quaise has already crossed the more daunting chasm from never melting rock with an energy beam to doing so daily.\n* Geothermal\n* Clean energy\n* Southeast\n* Texas\nJulian Spector is a senior reporter at Canary Media.

Yet the vast majority of the global supply of hydrogen is made through methods that use fossil fuels and generate planet-heating emissions. When made with electrolyzers powered by renewable energy, hydrogen produces almost no emissions at all, but production of this form \u2013 green hydrogen \u2013 is nascent and comes at a high premium.

Though the national government opened China to imported scrap steel that could be used in EAFs, imports halved in 2024\nBut if China can deepen its stockpiles of scrap steel, the country could more quickly build out a lower-carbon steel industry using EAFs while it waits to improve technology on green hydrogen that can bring down costs of fully decarbonized steel, Shen said.\n\u201c\u201c\nThe bottleneck, she said, is \u201cDRI\nBut two recent policy changes on renewable power could incentivize Chinese companies to use more of the nation\u2019s vast solar and wind resources to generate green hydrogen.\nThe first, called the 4301531\u201c\nWhether policies that direct renewable power away from the grid benefit hydrogen producers by making that power more available to them depends on the provincial-level strategies for the fuel, which vary, Shen said.

But I can tell you I am tired of the constant parade of articles that praise China for renewable development when they have built more coal in the past 10 years than the US has ever used. The emissions produced from this coal generation in China swamps the almost the entire world use of coal at this point, but let's make sure we continue to praise China for renewable development as the continue to add 50,000 MW of new coal production each year. Makes perfect sense to not present the facts about what they are doing versus talking about the fact that we've all but eliminated coal in our energy production stack and reduced the electric industry's emission profile by more than 60% in the past 25 years while China's environmental emissions are increasing exponentially year over year. But congratulations to China for building a little bit of wind and solar and producing green steel. Keep shotting those BB's at the elephant issue of your coal emissions that continue to exponentially increase.\nP\nPeter Taylor\n0 points\n2 months ago\nRe Chris Hickman's comment: \"But congratulations to China for building a little bit of wind and solar ....\" Are you unaware that China has installed more wind and solar generation capacity than the rest of the world out together for three years running? That's not \"a little bit\". I do not belittle their enormous CO2 emissions, although they were lower in the first half of 2025 than the first half of 2024. A large part of those emissions are to make goods for developed countries like ourselves. Just about every manufactured item I see in the shops was \"made in China\". But the emissions associated with their manufacture also happen in China, whereas they should be attributed to importing countries. The best thing developed countries can do is to stop buying their manufactured goods and make them at home or at least on the same continent.\nD\nDominik Lenn\u00e9\n0 points\n2 months ago\nGood article, thx. i m o , the situation will change with an emission cap based emissions trading system in China, as opposed to the current emission-intensity based system, which is leading to only very moderate progress on the emission side. Rumour has it, that such a cap will come ~~ 2030. When it's there, the price for high-emissions steel will go up within China as well and a clear incentive for low emission steel plants will be there. (Plus, EUs CBAM will put a lesser import tariff on CHN steel.) Also, low carbon H2 can be produced with NG and CCS. I don't know whether China is exploring this path - might yield cheaper low - carbon steel, if working one day.\n## read next\n* ![Gray metal boxes lined up with a blue sky overhead ](\nBatteries\n### California has a new law to prevent big grid battery fires\n* ![Aerial shot of a large warehouse complex next to homes ](\nVirtual power plants\n### Can crowdsourcing help solve the data-center power crunch?\n* ![A large ship with cargo at a port ](\nMarine transport\n### Global rules to decarbonize ships delayed amid Trump\u2019s pushback\n* ![ ](\nPolitics\n### The DOE\u2019s loan office enters its \u2018energy dominance\u2019 era\n![](",

Let\u2019s dig into the details of this clean-heating tech.\n## How geothermal heat pumps work\nGround-source heat pumps, also called geo-exchange, earth-coupled, and earth-energy heat pumps, are so efficient because they tap heat where it\u2019s steady and abundant: underground.\nThe appliances connect to flexible plastic pipes that delve into the earth.

Dandelion has gotten better at taking geology into account; a home on bedrock, a great thermal conductor, doesn\u2019t need as much ground loop as a similar home on clay. And the company has moved from water-well drilling rigs to more-compact ones that can be operated by fewer people, she said. Today, drilling costs are about two-thirds of what they were when the company started in 2017\nThe beloved TV2019\nReducing a home\u2019s heating demands by weatherizing it first can help you spend less on a heat pump and energy bills, whether you choose an air-source or ground-source system.\n## Incentives for geothermal heat pumps\nHomeowners can take advantage of thousands of dollars in tax credits and rebates from the federal government, states, and utilities to get ground-source heat pumps.\nThe biggest incentive is the federal 25 after its section of the tax code. Offering 3025 is uncapped. By contrast, 25, is limited to $2000\nThe 25 tax credit first took effect in 200820222032killing the IRA.\nEven if Congress does repeal the tax credit, homeowners should still be able to claim the credit next year as long as they have finished installing their ground-source heat pump systems while 25 is still on the books, according to \u201c\nGenerous, even enormous incentives can also be found elsewhere, especially in the Northeast with its cold winters and a legacy of expensive fuel-oil systems.

Ask about the projected total lifetime cost; it could be lower for a geothermal heat pump than for an air-source system because of its low operating costs, especially after incentives. And as with any major home project, get multiple quotes.\nGeothermal heat pumps are the most efficient home-heating systems available.

The Trump administration is erecting obstacle after obstacle to block clean energy, particularly wind projects. (Jim West\/UCG\/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)\nHundreds of business people, policy analysts, and conservative advocates filled a downtown Cleveland conference hall last week for the National Conservative Energy Summit. One major theme: the need for both the federal and local governments to remove increasingly high hurdles to building renewable energy.\n\u201cCEO\nThe group, which cohosted the program with the Ohio Conservative Energy Forum, has a mission \u201c\nThe Trump administration has taken a more single-minded approach to energy.\nSince January, it has promoted more fossil-fuel use and stalled the retirement of aging power plants. At the same time, it has rescinded grants and loans for clean energy projects; eliminated tax credits for wind, solar, EVs, and home-energy upgrades; and even halted construction on some offshore wind projects.\n\u201c\u201c\nAs President Donald Trump attacks clean energy at the federal level, some states like Colorado and Maine are pushing to speed up deployment. But in general, state and local laws that restrict renewable energy development are 1645040\nSpeaking at the conference, Jenifer French, chair of Ohio\u2019s Power Siting Board and its Public Utilities Commission, noted that approximately 30202152public interest in several cases where bans didn\u2019t apply but where local governments unanimously opposed the proposals.\nAsked for her advice to developers, French said, \u201c\nCompanies often hear such suggestions, but \u201c\nNo matter how many community meetings are held, some people will still fight projects, putting pressure on local officials who may not have expertise in energy issues, he noted.\nThe deference to local governments creates a slippery slope, said Amanda Stallings, senior policy manager for clean-energy developer Geronimo Power, who also spoke on the panel. In her view, the states that pile on restrictive policies will not only see less investment from solar and wind developers, but will also discourage other industries from moving in.\nConstraints on renewables also tread on landowners\u2019 property rights, Stallings said, pointing out that in some cases a local government tells farmers not to use their land for solar but would have no problem with a housing development.\n\u201c\nMeanwhile, \u201cISOwarned of potential reliability issues from delaying Revolution Wind, a nearly finished offshore project that the Trump administration has halted for now.\nThis past spring, Ohio managed to pass bipartisan legislation that is expected to help the state build more energy \u2014 both renewable and fossil-fueled \u2014 in large part because the law doesn\u2019t pick winners, according to state Rep.

(Greenlane)\nIt\u2019s a tough time for electric trucking in the U.S. The Trump administration has cut off funding for heavy-duty vehicle charging and port infrastructure. Republicans in Congress are trying to rescind states\u2019 authority to set clean vehicle mandates. And tariffs are throttling incoming cargoes to U.S. ports, hampering the business of trucking as a whole while likely also driving up the already-high price of battery-powered trucks.\nBut in Southern California, the transition away from diesel trucks, which emit a disproportionate share of the transportation sector\u2019s planet-warming and health-harming emissions, is moving forward despite federal policy obstacles. Two big all-electric charging depots opened in April to serve clean trucks operating in the region, which is home to the busiest seaport complex in the country and is the epicenter of U.S. electric truck adoption.\nThe first, located in Rancho Dominguez, 12startup with more than $1 in capital and that is working with a 720125\nThe 601240029\u201c18010\nThese facilities are the latest in a line of big truck-charging depots springing up across California, built by major firms like logistics operators like Prologis, and startups including Forum Mobility, Voltera, and WattEV. This proliferation is in response to the state\u2019s ambitious truck electrification goals, which include a target for completely zero-emissions fleets by 2045\nTerawatt\u2019s and Greenlane\u2019s newly opened electric truck stops represent a new class of charging site meant to serve the next phase in the Southern California electric truck charging evolution.\nEarly truck-charging sites were designed to serve shorter-range trucks that deliver goods from a central warehouse before returning to recharge overnight. But Terawatt\u2019s and Greenlane\u2019s new depots are meant to function more like a classic highway stop for battery-powered trucks looking to deliver goods hundreds of miles away.\nThe new stations will support more routes per day from Southern California\u2019s crowded ports to its distribution warehouses further inland, said Emilia Sibley, lead of Terawatt\u2019s heavy-duty business unit.

Those are important both for on-the-go truckers spending a half hour to an hour to top up their batteries for the next leg of their journey and for trucks reserving bobtail spots to recharge overnight.\n\u201c\u201c\n## The risks and rewards of building truck-charging depots\nThis build-it-and-they-will-come approach to electric trucking comes with its fair share of financial risk \u2014 particularly in the shadow of the second Trump administration.\nThe administration has frozen or restricted billions of dollars in grant funding authorized by Congress in the 20212022for building charging infrastructure on major transit corridors and\nThe Trump administration Advanced Clean Fleets mandate, which set statewide zero-emissions truck purchasing quotas on most large truck fleets.\nMeanwhile, Republicans in Congress 10\nEconomic troubles are compounding the regulatory uncertainty. President Donald Trump\u2019s crushingly high tariffs imposed on China have led to a major reduction in cargo being shipped to U.S. ports, any\nThose tariffs will also drive up the cost of lithium-ion batteries, most of which are made in China today. Battery costs are the biggest reason why electric trucks remain\nThese headwinds further complicate the inherently uncertain economics of electric truck charging.

Now a new state energy-efficiency plan aims to accelerate the trend to cut emissions and control power prices.\n![](\nBy Sarah Shemkus\n14 May 2025\n* *\n!A person stands next to a ladder inside a home. An appliance lays on the ground nearby.\nA worker installs a heat pump in a home in Standish, Maine. (Brianna Soukup\/Portland Press Herald via Getty Images)\nMaine\u2019s\nThe plan, set to go into effect in July, is heavily focused on getting electric heat pumps in as many homes as possible. It comes as other states debate rolling back efficiency programs funded by utility customers as a short-term fix to rising energy prices. Maine\u2019s strategy takes the opposite approach: It leverages investments in efficiency and electrification to lower rates for everyone.\n\u201c\u201c\nMaine has been an aggressive adopter of home heat pumps in recent years. In 201910000020251750002027\nThe state\u2019s new energy-efficiency plan is geared toward continuing this progress. It is centered largely on the idea of \u201c\nOver the next three years, the incentives in the plan are forecast to support 380006500990090003000\nThis strategy should decrease annual heating costs by more than $1000490\nHow? Utilities have certain fixed costs, such as maintaining power lines. To pay for them \u2014 and this is a bit of a simplification \u2014 they essentially divide the expense by the amount of power they expect customers to use in a year, and add that number to the rate they charge per kilowatt-hour. When more heat pumps come online, power demand goes up, so the fixed costs are spread out over more kilowatt-hours, lowering bills for the average consumer.\nAccomplishing that effect depends on finding ways to make sure much of the added demand occurs during off-peak hours, when there is plenty of room for more power to flow along the lines without building out more infrastructure and thus increasing the utilities\u2019 fixed costs. To achieve this timing, Maine\u2019s plan includes demand-response programs that pay consumers for using less energy at peak times, an incentive for low-income residents to buy electric vehicles with chargers that can be set to work at off-peak times, and other measures.\n\u201c\u201c\nMaine\u2019s plan also includes an innovative program that calls for Efficiency Maine Trust to negotiate with retailers and distributors for discounted prices on electric water heaters and for agreements to keep the equipment in stock. The strategy is particularly effective at getting people to switch from fossil-fuel water heaters in moments when their old equipment has failed and they are searching for an affordable, easily available replacement, said Erin Cosgrove, director of policy and programs for the nonprofit Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships.\n\u201c\nMore states have prioritized electrification in their efficiency programs in recent years, said Mark Kresowik, senior policy director for the research group American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. Massachusetts, for example, phased out its incentives for oil and gas equipment last year, and Washington, D.C., has also eliminated rebates for fossil-fuel-powered systems and appliances.\n\u201c\u201c\nEnergy-efficiency programs have traditionally centered the big-picture goal of helping consumers lower their energy use to save money and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, whether that energy comes from an oil-delivery truck, a natural gas pipe, or over power lines.\nAmid rising concern about climate change, however, more states have looked for ways to amplify the emissions impact of their programs. The solution has been to limit or eliminate incentives for fossil-fuel equipment and lean into electrification, which can often save consumers money and almost always reduce the emissions associated with heating and cooling their homes.\n\u201c\n* Energy efficiency\n* Electrification\n* Emissions reduction\n* Heat pumps\n* Northeast\n* Maine\nSarah Shemkus is a reporter at Canary Media who is based in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and covers New England.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\nUpvotesNewestOldest\n![](\nGreg Ballantyne\n0 points\n6 months ago\nCommunity solar does a great deal to lower electricity costs.

Now the effort is paying off in an undeniable way.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Energy might \u201c\nFrom January to July, as 39262032nearly unseating gas as the largest source of power.\nThese trends have resulted in numerous clean energy records this summer. In the California Independent System Operator\u2019s grid, which serves most of the state, solar delivered a record 30730\nCalifornia\u2019s electricity supply increasingly diverges from the nation\u2019s. Gas has predominated since 20164016207\nInitially, California\u2019s billions of dollars in solar subsidies and suite of supporting policies couldn\u2019t overcome the state\u2019s gas dependency. The solar systems cranked out excess power through the sunny hours, much of which got curtailed for lack of simultaneous demand, then California turned to fossil fuels to keep the lights on at night. That addiction at times overpowered the state\u2019s environmental ethos: California even opted in 2020\nSuch desperation gave temporary succor to solar skeptics and gas boosters. But when an energy system starts to change, snapshots in time are less instructive than the trend lines. And California\u2019s trend lines have been pointing in one direction.\nWhile the state hasn\u2019t been building new gas generation, it has connected gigawatts of new solar and batteries each year. These resources are nearly free to operate once built, while gas plant owners have to buy fuel to combust and keep complex machinery in fine working order. And the liquefied exports going to the highest bidder). Now California\u2019s gas plants have more competition in the peak hours from cheaper, cleaner resources; they\u2019re getting squeezed toward fewer hours of intense demand.\nBut it would be a mistake to think that these trends stop at the Sierra Nevada. Indeed, these patterns are playing out nationally: Very little new gas capacity is getting built, quite a lot of solar and batteries are, and gas prices are going up.\nSome regions allow developers to respond nimbly to these trends, namely Texas, which indeed has leapt ahead of California in its pace of solar and storage installations. Other regions obstruct such dynamism and face the consequences, like the mid-Atlantic wholesale markets run by PJMskyrocketing capacity auctions are pushing costs to crisis levels.\nCalifornia\u2019s grid overhaul has been a long time coming, and one lesson here is that big changes \u2014 like redesigning the energy system for the world\u2019s fourth largest economy \u2014 take time. But other states won\u2019t have to wait as long: They can tap into a mature supply chain that scaled up thanks to California and other early adopters, plus the industrial expertise to design and manage large solar construction efforts and the financing options de-risked by years of data from earlier projects.\nThe federal government is trying to stymie renewables however it can. But California is demonstrating the rewards for getting solar to escape velocity, and that momentum is set to carry forward in the coming years.\n* Solar\n* Batteries\n* Clean energy\nJulian Spector is a senior reporter at Canary Media.

Those projects need funding to progress and meet deadlines set by the grid operator to stay in the queue, Medakkar explained.\n\u201c\u201c\nA letter from storage and renewable developers to the chief of the Commerce Commission\u2019s Public Utilities Bureau, offering comments on the draft report, noted that storage projects take seven to 102030\n\u201c\u201c\n## What\u2019s the best way to incentivize grid batteries?\nThe commission\u2019s report proposes incentivizing storage through a market for indexed storage credits, structured similarly to the state\u2019s renewable energy credit program that has fueled a boom in solar power and, to a lesser degree, wind power. Under this design, the developer or owner of the storage is essentially allowed to sell credits for funds awarded by the state and collected from utility customers.\nNew York is the only other state with a storage credit market, according to experts. If Illinois passes legislation and launches the program this summer, it will be rolling out around the same time as the nascent program in New York, scheduled to hold its first procurement by the end of June. In other states, grid storage is supported through a structure known as tolling agreements, wherein utilities or other companies build and operate battery installations on the grid, and utility customers are essentially charged for their use.\nIn both models, residents pay for the new storage through their electric bills \u2014 just as they pay for renewables under Illinois\u2019 existing renewable energy credit program. The Commerce Commission found that 3GW39169\nDanielson said battery storage developers prefer a tolling structure since it is a much more common and potentially more effective practice.

In comments to the commission on behalf of clean energy groups, Gignac stated that solar and wind developers can request waivers under the state law if they can\u2019t find equity-qualifying candidates for certain jobs; meanwhile, there is \u201c\nThe final recommendations encourage the same equity standards for storage development as for renewables, a change lauded by advocates.\n\u201c\nClean energy advocates and industry representatives plan to encourage lawmakers to amend or introduce legislation based on the findings in the Commerce Commission\u2019s report, they said\nThe Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition, which helped pass CEJApushing for a new energy omnibus bill this legislative session.

(Felix H\u00f6rhager\/picture alliance via Getty Images)\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine three years ago, it ignited an energy crisis that threatened to upend Europe.\nThe continent relied on Russia for much of its gas supply for electricity and heating. Suddenly, European consumers faced soaring fuel prices, which rewarded Russia for the very chaos it had caused. European leaders became determined to find replacements for Russian fossil fuels, so they could stop paying the aggressor to fund its own war effort.\nClimate activists argued for seizing the opportunity to hasten Europe\u2019s clean energy transition by building more renewables and electrifying gas heating, and the European Commission linked the \u201c2022EU40452030\nNow that three years have passed, it\u2019s worth taking stock of just how Europe has fared with these ambitious goals.\nThe continent has indeed radically reduced dependence on an aggressive Russia to keep its lights on and its homes heated, and it has cut overall usage of fossil fuels since the war began, especially in the power sector.\n\u201c\nThat decimation of energy flows from Russia represents a huge geopolitical success for Europe, one that would have been hard to envision prior to the war. Meanwhile, the EU\nOf course, many factors outside of climate policy enabled this outcome.\nAmerican shipments of liquefied natural gas took the place of much of that Russian fuel, swapping one country\u2019s planet-warming fossil fuels for another\u2019s. Some factories shut down or moved overseas rather than operate with such high energy costs. The energy price spike acted as an unintended carbon price, pushing consumers to limit gas combustion out of financial necessity. Relatively mild winters also offered reprieve from ruinous heating bills.\nIn short, many of the factors driving down gas demand were entirely separate from muscular climate policies, and not necessarily permanent. As a result, the aggressive decarbonization that many had envisioned has not been fully realized.\n\u201c\u2018\u201c\n## Europe cut total gas demand and replaced most Russian imports\nEurope uses gas for many things: generating electricity, heating buildings, supplying heavy industry. Over the last three years, Europe has managed to lower its total gas demand while almost zeroing out the gas it gets from Russia.\nEurope consumed about 4002021802020232024\n\u201c1102024\u201c\nEurope imported about 140202130202420251521\nCorbeau cautioned against attributing too much to electrification and renewables policies. Those efforts made a mark in the power sector, but in many cases 2020212023\n\u201c\u201c2025\nLowering gas consumption at the expense of a thriving industrial sector is not the kind of trade-off European leaders want to make. Indeed, they finalized a Clean Industrial Deal last month to show that decarbonization can proceed without snuffing out factories entirely, but that policy has not had time to make an impact yet.\nThe question lingering over the top-line gas decrease is whether it will persist.\nGas consumption plummeted amid the 2022BNEF\u201c\u201c\n## Clean energy surges across European power sector\nEuropean nations have succeeded best at driving gas out of their electricity supply.\nSteady advances in solar and wind installations helped renewables generate 7129\nFossil-fuel generation fell 9202416solar produced more power than coal for the first time in EU last year.

This created some success stories: Germany prioritized renewables construction over other interests in permitting discussions. Italy, by contrast, gave siting power to regional governments, which let some regions slow or ban renewables entirely, Perelli-Rocco added.\n## Heat pumps leapt ahead, at least temporarily\nSome 40\n\u201c\nEarly efforts got rapid results after the Ukraine invasion: European heat pump sales shot up 4020212022202328\n\u201c2024\u201c\nThe price of heat pumps is coming down as manufacturing volume goes up, said Bond, who has researched the learning curves exhibited by these and other clean energy technologies.

(peeterv via Getty Images)\nA number of Connecticut cities and towns want to secure more clean electricity for residents using a program that has already saved millions of dollars for consumers in other states.\nCommunity choice aggregation allows cities and towns \u2014 or, in some cases, multiple municipalities working together \u2014 to negotiate with electricity suppliers on behalf of their residents. The goal is to achieve lower rates than those offered by utilities, often with a higher percentage of renewable energy in the mix.\n\u201c\u201c\nNationally, community choice aggregation, also known as municipal aggregation, is authorized by 1011th\nData suggest there are opportunities for meaningful savings. In Massachusetts, 2253512024200237511\n\u201c\u201c\nConnecticut\u2019s version of aggregation could be particularly ambitious, following a model used in California and New Hampshire. This approach allows cities and towns to choose between a basic aggregation program, in which a hired energy broker negotiates for electricity on behalf of residents, and a system in which multiple municipalities band together to form a larger aggregator that could handle the process of procuring power itself.\nThe multi-community approach allows these aggregation groups to retain the revenues that would have gone to an outside broker and use these reserve funds to develop and manage their own programs aimed at producing renewable energy, supporting energy efficiency, or reducing demand. In its first year, New Hampshire\u2019s aggregation program saved ratepayers in participating communities about $1410\nIn California, this strategy has helped fund dozens of programs including battery rebates, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and discounts on solar power for low-income households.\nSome skeptics of community choice aggregation have raised concerns about Connecticut\u2019s proposed model, which would make a city or town\u2019s negotiated rate the default for residents but allow them to opt out if they\u2019d rather stick with utility service or an alternate supplier. Consumers, they say, should not be placed in a new program without choosing to make the move.\nSupporters, however, argue that the successes in states where municipal aggregation has already been deployed demonstrate the model works with little risk to consumers.\n\u201c\u201c\n* Clean energy\n* Emissions reduction\n* Policy & regulation\n* Northeast\n* Connecticut\nSarah Shemkus is a reporter at Canary Media who is based in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and covers New England.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\n## read next\n* ![ ](\nGeothermal\n### California can\u2019t get out of its own way on geothermal\n* ![Profile shot of a woman speaking into a microphone ](\nUtilities\n### Why utility regulators need to do more than call \u2018balls and strikes\u2019\n* ![ ](\nSponsored\n### The case for optimism in America\u2019s energy transition\n* ![Aerial shot of large warehouse surrounded by other buildings ](\nBatteries\n### In a first, a data center is using a big battery to get online faster\n![](",

None of these have killed anyone, but a pivotal 2019\nMoss Landing\u2019s design was \u201c1950\nIn this case, the lack of exact copycats is very good news: It means that the design elements that allowed Moss Landing to burn so apocalyptically are not present in newer or forthcoming battery plants. The bad news is that a handful of other battery projects built around the same time as Moss Landing are slated to operate for years to come.\n## Key factors in the Moss Landing battery fire\nWe don\u2019t know what caused the Moss Landing fire, but we do know two big factors that help explain why the facility burned so spectacularly.\nFirst off, Vistra used batteries manufactured by Korea\u2019s LGLGNMC\nIndeed, many of the most prominent battery fires in the U.S. sprang from LG2024LGLG2020\nNMCEV\nThe grid storage market has also LFPLFP2021\nThe other defining factor specific to Moss Landing was the choice to use a large, legacy building to house rows and rows of battery racks.\nThat decision made sense at the time. California was looking for big batteries to help its shift to clean energy, and Vistra had taken over the old Moss Landing power plant in its acquisition of power producer Dynegy. In hindsight, it seems that the design choice packed too much battery fuel into one enclosed space, creating the conditions for an unstoppable, 100\nNearly all grid batteries installed in the past several years have opted not for one overarching building but for row upon row of modular battery containers. Each box contains batteries, controls, and safety equipment. Projects are designed so that if a fire breaks out at one individual container, it won\u2019t propagate to neighboring units. This limits the amount of fuel a fire could engulf and makes it easier for emergency responders to suppress a fire with water.\nCase in point: A fire broke out at the neighboring Tesla project in September 2022\n## A brief history of battery safety regulations\nWhile industry trends have moved toward safer batteries and containerized systems, fire safety codes have also evolved.\nTwo major fire safety codes govern grid battery installations today: Most states, including California, to International Fire Code (IFCNFPA855\nIFC2018NFPA85520192020NFPA855\nCalifornia regulators formally 20182020\nThe state began enforcing the 2018IFC\nMoss Landing may have reflected the storage industry\u2019s best insights into battery safety, but the industry was considerably younger then. The U.S. installed just 300MW\nWhen Moss Landing was under development, the storage industry hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to learn from mistakes. After the battery fire erupted near Phoenix in 20192020\nThe upshot here is that nobody building a battery project today would do it with the particular technological generation of batteries or the fire code specs that Vistra used at Moss Landing. Now the lessons learned from Moss Landing will shape the fire codes for projects that come after.\n\u201c\u201c\nIn another promising new trend for battery safety, leading manufacturers now perform more intensive fire testing of lithium-ion cabinets, not just individual cells or modules, said Warner, who co-founded the Energy Safety Response Group. This kind of large-scale testing with real fire is being incorporated into forthcoming safety code updates, Warner added, and provides much more realistic data for understanding how batteries behave in a fire compared with extrapolations from small-scale fire or stress tests.\nThe industry\u2019s incremental progress on safety didn\u2019t stop the residents of Moss Landing from having to flee their homes again, and that\u2019s a major failure. But a justifiably wary public can rest assured that this particular facility has little in common with the rest of the United States\u2019 rapidly growing grid battery fleet.\n* Energy storage\n* Batteries\n* West\n* California\nJulian Spector is a senior reporter at Canary Media.

It should be added that UL 9540 (the safety standard for ESS) which has been required by the last two code cycles of the IFC, IRC, and NFPA 855 has proven quite effective and there have been very few incidents with UL 9540 listed ESS.\nAnother item to mention that both LFP and NMC have safety considerations that are different, but important to understand. Neither is better or worse, just different safety profiles with NMC being more vulnerable to thermal runaway and LFP creating more potential off gassing in thermal runaway.\n## read next\n* ![Gray metal boxes lined up with a blue sky overhead ](\nBatteries\n### California has a new law to prevent big grid battery fires\n* ![Aerial shot of a large warehouse complex next to homes ](\nVirtual power plants\n### Can crowdsourcing help solve the data-center power crunch?\n* ![A large ship with cargo at a port ](\nMarine transport\n### Global rules to decarbonize ships delayed amid Trump\u2019s pushback\n* ![ ](\nPolitics\n### The DOE\u2019s loan office enters its \u2018energy dominance\u2019 era\n![](",

    "content":"The EV\n![](\nBy Julian Spector\n2 July 2025\n* *\n![](\nRedwood Materials is powering a data center outside Reno, Nevada, with a large solar array and over 700 used EV batteries, pictured above. (Courtesy of Redwood Materials)\nRENOJB\nMy Redwood tour guide assured me, however, that we were in the right place. Underneath those white shrouds were 792EV\nRedwood hailed the installation as a breakthrough in the sleepy field of second-life batteries, which has been around for a while but failed to move beyond initial proofs of concept to repeated, large-scale deployments. The firm has indeed broken a record for that stunted sector, certainly in the U.S. and likely the world, delivering 631247\nGiven the initial success, Straubel sees the energy storage business as a key growth area for Redwood, which was founded in 2017\n\u201c\u201c\nAssuming the concept scales up further, it could be a game changer for data centers that prize speedy new energy construction. But it could further reshape the clean energy transition. Dozens of startups have toiled for years to invent new batteries for long-duration storage. Redwood has already beaten them to a large-scale deployment, without inventing anything new and risky \u2014 all it took was some clever reimagining of what others viewed as waste.\n## A radical new approach to second-life battery design\nUsing old EVEV80\nYet few second-life grid storage installations exist.\nMost of the people who have actually installed second-life batteries have approached it as a small-scale research project, typically grant-funded. A scrappy company called B2U2020built an array of old packs to deliver solar power into California\u2019s energy markets in the most lucrative evening hours. I verified that with my own eyes in 2021B2U2812\nAnother startup called Element Energy obtained a bounty of lightly used packs, quite possibly through their investor LG53. Next, it plans to build a factory to mass-produce enclosures for second-life installations.\nNow, Redwood has entered the scene with its sprawling Nevada installation.\nAll of these developers have had to grapple with the same initial challenges. They need to get their hands on old EV\nRedwood immediately stands out for its ability to handily source old packs. The company is, officially, a battery recycler, and it says it receives more old batteries than any of its U.S. competitors. All week long, trucks drop off pallets of everything from toothbrush batteries to electric-truck packs, which workers sort and stash in a 32\n\u201cEV120235\n\u201c\nAnother differentiator might as well be called moxie. Founder Straubel sets the tone as a clean-energy nerd who just likes to give things a shot. He tried second-life microgrids at home before making it a focus for the workplace. His engineers hacked together a universal controller box that connects to each type of EV\n![]( The solar array that powers Crusoe\u2019s data center, tucked in between Redwood\u2019s recycling facilities. The open-air depot where Redwood receives and stores battery deliveries is visible in the back right. (Courtesy of Redwood Materials)\nLastly, the Redwood approach bucks conventional opinion in ways that save time and money.\nThe storage industry, as a rule, puts its batteries in big metal boxes. Redwood engineers saw that as unnecessary, given how painstakingly ruggedized the packs had to be for vehicular use. No big boxes means no pouring concrete pads. The approach saves on labor, time, and materials.\n\u201c\u201c\nOn the solar side, Redwood went with a company that shares the \u201cErthos, a scrappy new alternative to the highly engineered trackers that eke every last electron out of the day\u2019s solar arc. This flat-on-the-ground installation also allows a handful of cleaning robots to circumnavigate the array daily and wipe the dust away; their little headlights peeked through the night as Redwood\u2019s celebration cast laser lights across the battery field.\n## **AI**\nRedwood launched Redwood Energy, its business line for second-life storage, at a precarious time for the battery recycling industry, which has promised to recover nearly all the useful materials from old EV\nRedwood succeeded in raising nearly $2 in equity investment since its founding in 2017declared bankruptcy this year after failing to raise the money to complete its recycling facility in upstate New York. Another top contender, Ascend Elements, has pushed back its timeline for a facility in Kentucky, citing delays from its anchor customer.\nThe actual task of economically recovering the most valuable battery materials appears to have proven harder in practice than it looked in the pitch decks. Setting aside the technical challenges, there are serious business obstacles. Many key battery commodities have fallen steeply from high prices a few years back, undercutting the value of the recycled products. And there isn\u2019t yet a critical mass of cathode makers to sell to in the U.S., so any recovered materials are just going to generic metals markets for now.\n\u201cEV\nWhile that market for recycled materials develops, Redwood can pull in \u201c\n\u201c\u201c\nThat\u2019s somewhat jarring to hear from the battery recycling startup with the most money behind it. The investors funded a battery materials business, not a second-hand battery purveyor. But Straubel stressed that he sees the energy business as additive, not competitive with the original business.\n\u201c\u201c\nRedwood Energy is talking with AI\n\u201c\nA clarification was made on July 72025B2U1228\n* Energy storage\n* Batteries\n* Long-duration energy storage\n* West\n* Nevada\nJulian Spector is a senior reporter at Canary Media.

The U.S., which is the only major country that hasn\u2019t ratified the 1994\u201c\nDuring the negotiations, run by the United Nations affiliate known as the International Seabed Authority, little progress was made on the specific task at hand: finalizing a code that would permit commercial mining on the high seas under the Law of the Sea.\nInstead, during the two final days, the high-stakes deep-sea mining talks devolved into a public airing of grievances against the United States \u2014 including by several of the country\u2019s allies, who, in an unusual move, have started to align more with China over the U.S. in the increasingly contentious fight.\nThat\u2019s because President Donald Trump has been pushing the U.S. to barrel ahead on deep-sea mining. The country plans to permit mining in international waters under an obscure U.S. law from 1980\u201c\nMany legal experts worry that invoking the antiquated act now is a violation of international law.\nFor years, a handful of private firms have pushed the international community to green-light deep-sea mining, which they argue offers a less environmentally destructive path than land-based mining for acquiring the metals needed for the clean-energy transition. Scientists, environmental advocates, and others, meanwhile, have fiercely criticized the idea, calling into question the claim that deep-sea mining is the lesser of two evils \u2014 or even an economically feasible enterprise.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s new push to unilaterally license mining was seen as a slap in the face to the dozens of countries meeting in Jamaica last month. Delegates emphasized that the International Seabed Authority is the only entity legally authorized to permit mining in ocean areas that lie beyond nations\u2019 jurisdictions.\nA main point of contention is that, according to the U.N. treaty, the international seabed is designated the \u201c\n\u201c21\n!People in business attire sit at long tables facing a panel of people sitting at a raised wooden desk\nFrom July 21 to July 25, the U.N.-affiliated International Seabed Authority hosted the annual assembly of countries that are party to the Law of the Sea.

These minerals are currently used in most of the lithium-ion batteries that go in EVs, but it\u2019s unclear how much the auto industry will need in the coming decades.

(Bright Saver)\nSmall solar-panel kits that can be assembled as easily as an Ikea bookcase and plugged into a regular residential outlet could be coming soon to New Hampshire and Vermont. Lawmakers and advocates in both states are preparing legislation that would make these plug-in solar systems accessible to residents who don\u2019t have the space, money, or inclination to install a larger, conventional rooftop array.\n\u201c\u201c\nThese systems \u2014 also called \u201c\u201c\nUnlike rooftop arrays, plug-in systems don\u2019t generate enough power to meet all, or even most, of a household\u2019s needs, but they offset enough consumption to pay for themselves within four or five years, even without incentives like tax credits or net metering, Chou said.

They also define safety standards for the systems, including that they be certified by Underwriters Laboratories, or UL\nAt the moment, two manufacturers make plug-in solar systems with inverters that have been certified as complying with safety requirements, Chou said.

It will be refined in the coming months and formally introduced in the legislature in January.\nNotably, Watters said, his proposal would not stop homeowners associations or landlords from imposing their own rules on members and tenants.\n\u201c\u201c\nIn Vermont, two Democratic state legislators \u2014 Sen. Anne Watson, chair of the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy, and Rep.

The state\u2019s governor, Phil Scott, however, is a Republican who has shown reluctance to spend public money on clean energy. Further, the legislature lost its veto-proof Democratic majorities during the last election, so prospects for forward movement on energy and climate issues have been dimmed this year.\nHowever, Watson has already heard a lot of positive feedback from her fellow lawmakers, even though the bill won\u2019t be taken up until the legislature reconvenes in January.

A \u201c20332040\nTo meet the report\u2019s unconstrained scenario, Virginia would need to erect twice as many solar farms per year by 20402024\nEven then, Virginia would need to double current power imports from other states. And it would still need to build new fossil-gas power plants, which would 15204059\nBut Perry and her colleagues face an uphill battle in their bid to more closely regulate data center growth. Data centers are big business in Virginia. Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, has \u201c7400091GDP\nStill, policymakers can\u2019t avoid their responsibility to \u201c\nFrom the mid-Atlantic down to Texas, tech giants and data center developers are demanding more power as soon as possible. If utilities, regulators, and policymakers move too rashly in response, they could unleash a surge in fossil-gas power-plant construction that will drive up consumer energy costs \u2014 and set back progress on shifting to carbon-free energy.\nBut this outcome is not inevitable. With some foresight, the data center boom can actually help \u2014 rather than hurt \u2014 the nation\u2019s already stressed-out grid. Data center developers can make choices right now that will lower grid costs and power-system emissions.\nAnd it just so happens that these solutions could also afford developers an advantage, allowing them to pay less for interconnection and power, win social license for their AI\nWhen it comes to the grid, the nation faces a computational crossroads: Down one road lie greater costs, slower interconnection, and higher emissions. Down the other lies cheaper, cleaner, faster power that could benefit everyone.\n## The big picture: A data center demand bubble\nAfter decades with virtually no increase in U.S. electricity demand, data centers are driving tens of gigawatts of power demand growth in some parts of the country, according to a\nProviding that much power would require \u201cNRG\nUtilities, regulators, and everyday customers have good reason to ask if the costs are worth it \u2014 because that\u2019s far from clear right now, he said.\nA fair amount of this growth is coming from data centers meant to serve well-established and solidly growing commercial demands, such as data storage, cloud computing, e-commerce, streaming video, and other internet services.\nBut the past two years have seen an explosion of power demand from sectors with far less certain futures.\nA significant, if opaque, portion is coming from cryptocurrency mining operations, notoriously unstable and fickle businesses that can quickly pick up and move to new locations in search of cheaper power. The most startling increases, however, are for AI\nHundreds of billions of dollars in near-term AIAI2030\nBeyond financial viability, these plans face physical limits. At least under current rules, power plants and grid infrastructure simply can\u2019t be built fast enough to provide what data center developers say they need.\n## Too big for the grid to handle\nBold data center ambitions have already collided with reality in Virginia.\n\u201cCEO\u201c\nSimilar constraints are emerging in other data center hot spots.\nThe utility Arizona Public Service 203820302023\nThese saturated conditions are pushing developers into new markets, as the below chart from the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie shows.\n!Wood Mackenzie chart of nearly 100 gigawatts of data center projects proposed in 18 U.S. states (Wood Mackenzie)\n\u201c\nOf that demand growth, only a fraction can be met by building new solar and wind farms, Seiple added. And \u201c\nSeiple is referring to data centers\u2019 need for reliable round-the-clock power, and utilities\u2019 responsibility to provide it, including at moments of peak demand, usually during hot summers and cold winters. A lot of the money utilities spend goes toward building the power plants and grid infrastructure needed to meet those demand peaks.\nWhere renewables fall short, other resources like carbon-free hydropower, nuclear, geothermal, or clean-powered batteries could technically be built to serve at least a large portion of data center demand. But that\u2019s generally not what\u2019s playing out on the ground.\nInstead, the data center boom is shaping up to be a huge boon for fossil-gas power plants. Investment bank Goldman Sachs AI5020304060\n## How data centers could make the grid dirtier\nEven tech firms with clean energy goals, like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, are having trouble squaring their soaring power needs with their professed climate commitments.\nOver the past decade, those four companies have secured roughly 40GW\nThe inability to match growing demand with more clean power isn\u2019t entirely these hyperscalers\u2019 fault.

But these options can\u2019t be brought online or scaled up quickly enough to meet short-term power needs.\n\u201cAIISI\u201c\nAnd many data center customers and developers are indifferent to clean energy; they simply seek whatever resource can get their facility online first, whether to churn out cryptocurrency or win an advantage in the AI\nUtilities that have sought for years to win regulatory approval for new gas plants have seized on data center load forecasts as a new rationale.\nA 108GW91GW\nIn Nebraska, the Omaha Public Power District has\n\u201c10\nIn some cases, tech companies oppose these fossil-fuel expansion plans.\nGeorgia Power last month 8GW2030allow data centers to secure more of their own clean power, was among those that\nBut in other instances, data center developers are direct participants.\nIn Louisiana, for example, 15GW\nState officials have 2GW15GW15\n\u201c15\nIn other cases, AIAI2024\nIn the absence of adequate grid service from Memphis\u2019 municipal utility, the site has been burning gas in mobile generators exempt from local air-quality regulations, despite concerns from residents of lower-income communities already burdened by industrial air pollution.\nIn December, xAI announced a tenfold increase in the site\u2019s computing capacity \u2014 a move that the nonprofit Southern Alliance for Clean Energy 150MW1GW\nThe nonprofit had hoped that \u201c\u201c\n## How data centers could help, not hurt, energy costs and climate goals\nIf gas plants are built as planned to power data centers, dreams of decarbonizing the grid in the near future are essentially out the window.\nBut data centers don\u2019t need to be powered by fossil fuels; it\u2019s not a foregone conclusion.\nAs Frontier Group\u2019s Good noted during last month\u2019s Public Interest Network webinar, \u201c\nIt\u2019s up to regulators to sort this out, said Silverman of Johns Hopkins University. \u201c\nThat\u2019s what the Virginia lawmakers proposing new data center bills said they were trying to do. Two of the bills would order state regulators to study whether 252040\nOther bills would give local governments power to review noise, water, and land-use impacts of data centers seeking to be sited in the state, require that data centers improve energy efficiency, and mandate quarterly reports of water and energy consumption.\nAnother sought to require that proposed new data centers undergo review by state utility regulators to ensure they won\u2019t pose grid reliability problems. Democratic Delegate Josh Thomas, the bill\u2019s sponsor, said that\u2019s needed to manage the risks of unexamined load growth. Without that kind of check, \u201c18\nBut that bill was\nData center developers have the ability to minimize or even help drive down power system costs and carbon emissions. They can work with utilities and regulators to bring more clean energy and batteries onto the grid or at data centers themselves.

Kowalski\n17 April 2025\n* *\n!Power lines, poles, and treetops silhouetted against a dimly lit sky\n(chemtrailchaser)\nOhio consumer and environmental advocates are calling on state regulators to address disparities within FirstEnergy\u2019s grid after a recent report found\nAreas defined as disadvantaged under the Biden administration\u2019s Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool were twice as likely to have low-voltage circuits compared to other parts of FirstEnergy\u2019s Ohio territory, according to the study by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. Equipment was also generally older and had less capacity for normal and overload situations.\nThe results reflect historical patterns of underinvestment in disadvantaged communities, the report says, but the full scope of the problem \u2014 including across Ohio\u2019s other utilities \u2014 is unclear due to the lack of information from utilities and regulators.\n\u201c\nThe Ohio Environmental Council submitted the report as part of 5\nThe state of the local grid matters when it comes to the reliability of customers\u2019 electric service, their ability to add distributed renewable energy resources like rooftop solar, and a community\u2019s potential to attract business investments that could improve its economic conditions.\nRegulated electric utilities file reliability reports each spring that focus on two commonly used metrics. The system average interruption frequency index, or SAIFICAIDI\nThe annual reports also list factors involved in outages, with breakouts for transmission-related service problems and major events. Major events such as severe weather are considered statistical outliers that don\u2019t count for calculating whether utilities meet their company-specific standards for CAIDISAIFI\nWhile weather accounted for the majority of time Ohioans went without power last year, equipment failures also triggered thousands of outages. For the ninth year in a row, at least one Ohio utility company failed to meet reliability standards, reports filed this month show. Both\nThe Public Utilities Commission of Ohio also collects data on the worst-performing circuits. Individual circuits serve anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand customers. However, the state doesn\u2019t post these reports online or disclose the circuit\u2019s exact locations, which could be used to show whether they are concentrated in disadvantaged communities.\nThe SAIFICAIDI\nUtilities in Ohio tend to be reactive in dealing with circuit problems, Banton said. Communities can face longer outages if utilities wait for equipment to fail before replacing it. Instead, Banton wants utilities\u2019 capital investments to address current disparities and then prevent them from recurring in the future.\n\u201c\n\u201c\nFirstEnergy has challenged the Ohio Environmental Council\u2019s objections about grid disparities in its rate case. Meanwhile, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio is due to consider revisions to the annual reliability reporting requirements by Sept. 302026\n## How the local grid impacts clean energy and economic development\nThe quality of a neighborhood\u2019s grid influences more than whether residents\u2019 lights stay on.\n\u201c\nRooftop solar or other distributed clean energy can add to traffic on local grid circuits, posing a challenge for equipment that\u2019s older or has lower voltages or capacity. Those circuits generally can handle less grid traffic, Banton said. In contrast, newer, high-voltage circuits tend to have \u201c\nThe grid\u2019s quality and capacity also impact an area\u2019s economic development. Historically, utilities have focused capital investment on places where people are moving or where they expect new industrial demand. That approach exacerbates inequity, Banton said. Even if businesses otherwise wanted to move to disadvantaged areas, poor electrical infrastructure may lead them to go elsewhere to avoid huge costs for upgrading the local grid, they said.\n\u201c\nBecause utilities have failed to invest in and maintain the grid evenly throughout their service territories, an equity-based approach to infrastructure modernization should make sure resources now go to areas that were left behind, Reames said.\nHe supports the report\u2019s call for more granular data, including details on customers with repeated or prolonged outages. The report also calls on utilities to publish maps showing grid capacity, and information about which census tracts are served by each circuit and substation transformers.\n\u201c\u2018\u201c\nLove Canary Media and find our reporting valuable?

Evidence from other states suggests such a rate could be implemented during the roll-out of advanced metering infrastructure, rather than waiting the minimum of four years the utilities say would be necessary for an EV-specific rate. The filing points to Colorado, where time-of-use rates are rolling out in concert with advanced metering infrastructure.\nAnother option would be to use data collected by vehicle computer systems or chargers themselves to issue rebates or apply lower rates for charging done at off-peak times. Utilities in California and Minnesota have already deployed this approach.\nThe same data could be used to offer other financial incentives.

Now, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has signed\nBatteries have become an integral part of California\u2019s push to clean up its electricity system. But the Moss Landing conflagration jolted the state as it burned for several days, provoked evacuations of surrounding communities, and destroyed an old power-plant hall that electricity company Vistra had packed full of lithium-ion batteries in 2020\nIn the years since Moss Landing came online, though, the grid battery industry has moved on from that type of design. These days, most every project places batteries in individual containers spaced out across an open field, which minimizes the chances of a fire spreading between them.\nEven with those advances in grid battery designs, state Sen. John Laird saw an opportunity to tighten state requirements in light of what happened in January, and he authored SB283\n\u201c\u201c\nInstead of leaving everything up to local jurisdictions \u2014 which may be reviewing a large battery project for the first time \u2014 the law requires developers to collaborate with first responders on emergency-response plans.

Her monthly utility bill from Duke Energy has been cut in half, she said.\nThe improvements are thanks to\n\u201c\u201c\nBoyd\u2019s home is among the roughly 1400Energy Savers Network has assisted with weatherization since its inception in late 2016\nBut Boyd\u2019s story is somewhat unique. She\u2019s in a smaller subset of people who\u2019ve benefited from a Duke initiative meant not just to aid the energy burdened in times of crisis, but to permanently reduce their electricity use through home efficiency improvements.\nAnd with politicians at the state and national levels turning against the clean energy transition in low-income communities and elsewhere, Boyd\u2019s experience is rare good news that advocates hope can continue to be replicated.\n## From utility bill assistance to energy efficiency\nEnergy Savers Network found Boyd through Duke\u2019s Customer Assistance Program. Part of a side deal the utility struck in 2023 to lessen the blow of its rate hikes, the program offers a monthly credit of up to $4215050000\nIn 2024\nNorth Carolina\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services manages the two funds and has a data-sharing agreement with Duke, which then enrolls customers in its program \u2014 a process that has minimized administrative expenses such as vetting participants for eligibility.\nAnd though in its first year the bill assistance benefited less than half the number of households forecast, experts say that\u2019s because funding for the two buckets of federal aid dropped, not because the need isn\u2019t great. Advocates remain bullish about the prospect for Duke to serve 100000\nTotaling over $500\nBut Boyd\u2019s case demonstrates the full potential of the Customer Assistance Program: Virtually every household receiving help gets referred to a local entity that can assess homes and perform free efficiency upgrades, reducing energy burdens beyond the 12\n## **\u201c**\nThe brainchild and passion project of former financial and utility consultant Brad Rouse, Energy Savers has undergone a few iterations over its nine years of existence. Its throughline is providing energy-efficiency retrofits, usually in a day\u2019s time, via a team of volunteers guided by a professional.\nWhen everything is running smoothly, that means the group can perform upgrades \u2014 such as adding insulation and sealing air leaks \u2014 for at least three homes a week, according to Rouse. But in its early years, Energy Savers sometimes struggled to meet that mark.\n\u201c\u201c\nBut now, the organization has almost eliminated that problem. \u201c\nThat\u2019s because the utility sends so many referrals that it\u2019s easier to find clients who will be ready by the time the Energy Savers team arrives, reducing the likelihood of cancellations. And when a client does fall through, there\u2019s a waiting list ready to be tapped.\nThe group identifies households in need through multiple channels, including farmers markets, community events, and word of mouth. But its largest source of referrals these days is the Customer Assistance Program, said Steffi Rausch, director of operations.\n\u201c\nBoyd, for instance, first got help paying her utility bills through Asheville Buncombe Community Christian Ministry, which accessed one of the federal crisis assistance funds for her. She was soon enrolled in Duke\u2019s $42\u201c\nIn the last 112636\n\u201c\u201c\nTo be sure, Duke and advocates for low-income customers are still working out kinks in the bill-credit scheme. One challenge is waning funding for the two federal crisis assistance initiatives that are used to automatically enroll individuals in the Customer Assistance Program. Another hurdle is connecting the dots for recipients, who often don\u2019t realize they\u2019re getting the bill credit or that they\u2019re getting referred to groups like Energy Savers.\nMost of all, advocates are mindful that the Customer Assistance Program is in the middle of a three-year pilot phase, and they want to extend it one way or another \u2014 as a feature of Duke\u2019s\nBoyd knows as well as advocates that the need for long-lasting energy savings is substantial.

It\u2019s all bad.\nThe thing is, it\u2019s also boring. I like to write nuanced stories explaining complicated issues, but what\u2019s the nuanced take on a climate-denial administration taking climate-denial actions? Is there a more sophisticated analysis of Trump pushing oil and gas, killing battery factories, lying that windmills cause cancer, and blaming the Green New Deal (which Congress never even passed) for the state of the economy than the obvious one: The dude likes fossil fuels and hates the climate?\nI doubt it. And I doubt it matters much whether Trump feels this way because he enjoys owning libs, because he\u2019s raking in oil and gas donations, or because he sincerely believes fossil fuels are harmless. Trump aides say he\u2019s simply committed to an all-of-the-above energy-abundance strategy to drive down energy costs, but that\u2019s bogus. It\u2019s some-of-the-above. He\u2019s throttling wind and solar projects that provide cheap power. He\u2019s pushing tariffs that drive up energy prices. He gaslights and defunds and deregulates like a fossil-fuel shill; he\u2019s a fossil-fuel shill.\nSo now what? As I\u2019ve been preparing to bring back my Eating the Earth column after some time off to finish\nThese are hard questions, harder than a lot of keyboard warriors make it sound. Bad things are happening, and more bad things will happen, but not all the things will be equally bad, and it will be counterproductive to turn the freak-out dial up to 11\nWhat matters is what happens, how bad it gets, and what progress can be made in the parts of climate world Trump doesn\u2019t control. The next four years will be a good time to figure out the best climate technologies and policies, even though the U.S. government won\u2019t pursue them. And there will be plenty of non-boring things to say about them.\nI\u2019m a little biased here \u2014 did I mention that\nSharp-eyed readers of Carl Hiaasen\u2019s raucous 2020\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\nIt\u2019s a funny book, if not a subtle one, with \u2014 spoiler alert! \u2014 a satisfying post-2020\u201c412\nOf course, in the real world, he\u2019s not.\nIn the wake of the 202021st\nBut instead, we\u2019re back in cuckooville, joining only Iran, Libya, and Yemen in rejecting the Paris accord. Every day, there\u2019s news about Trump rolling back climate programs and climate aid while axing environmental bureaucrats and environmental rules. It\u2019s not a lot more subtle than Hiaasen\u2019s depiction of Mastodon as \u201c\nThe media have an obvious responsibility to chronicle the carnage \u2014 I\u2019d recommend focusing less on what Trump says than what he does \u2014 but honestly, I wouldn\u2019t suggest that readers bum themselves out by doomscrolling through all the coverage. For example, the best place to find news about the clean energy transition happens to be an outlet called Canary Media, but unless it\u2019s your job to track this stuff, you\u2019ll make yourself crazy if you read every Canary story about a wind project biting the dust or a solar company in trouble. What you should read are Canary\u2019s big-picture stories about how the U.S. is still on track to install more grid batteries than ever, blue states are moving forward with green programs, and Europe is unveiling a clean industrial policy that would counteract Trump\u2019s fossil-fueled approach.\nThese days, the most useful and interesting clean energy stories \u2014 again, Canary is all over them \u2014 are about the post-Trump future. Like Eric Wesoff\u2019s dive into fusion, \u201c4050report on the prospects for turning methane into clean hydrogen. Or Maria Gallucci\u2019s look at the vast potential of geothermal power. The fate of these technologies will probably have a bigger impact on 2050\nIn general, it\u2019s smart not to hyperventilate about every move Trump makes to delay the clean energy transition, because the transition is happening. It really matters how long the transition takes, because energy generates two-thirds of the world\u2019s greenhouse gases, but we basically know where it\u2019s headed: toward a largely electrified economy powered by zero-emissions electricity.\nWhat we don\u2019t know is what the hell is going to happen with the other third of the emissions warming the planet, the greenhouse gases generated by our food and agriculture system. That system has not yet begun making a transition to a climate-friendlier approach. There\u2019s not even a consensus about what that kind of transition would look like.\nThat will be the subject of my Eating the Earth columns, and also of my book \u2014\nI explained our basic food and climate problem in my first Eating the Earth column: We\u2019ll need to grow about 50205075\nSo we can\u2019t stay on our current trajectory.\nUntil recently, there was only dim public awareness of any connection between food and climate \u2014 a vague (and, it turns out, incorrect) sense that GMOs, pesticides, and industrial agriculture in general are climate killers, while eating local, natural, and organic is climate-friendly. The 20232024\u201c\nIn fact, farming has a huge effect on climate change \u2014 more than transportation or industry, nearly as much as electricity. And while the rise of renewables has helped our energy and climate problem start getting a little better, though not nearly fast enough, our food and climate problem is still getting worse. Food is about 2525\nThe good news is that there are dozens of promising solutions that could help us eat less of the earth. I\u2019ve written about some of them: using fewer biofuels, eating chicken instead of beef, intensifying cattle pastures, and getting over our fear of high-tech meat substitutes. I promoted technological solutions like low-emissions fertilizers and a miracle tree called pongamia, while questioning whether vertical farming would ever pencil out. (It certainly\nTrump, needless to say, does not care. His administration is already trying to shut down President Joe Biden\u2019s $23\u201cwas actually climate-smart, so it\u2019s hard to say what effect this particular knee-jerk anti-climate response will have on global emissions. On the other hand, the Trump team has approved a billion-dollar Biden administration clean-energy loan for a Montana refinery to make \u201c a supposedly climate-friendly alternative to fossil fuel that may well end up eating much more of the earth.\nThe next four years, when serious climate policy is on hold in the U.S., will be a good time to piece together which of this stuff makes sense. Climate has become a partisan culture-war issue, but food and farming are still nonpartisan. Trump\u2019s unconventional health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is likely to clash with his conventional agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, over issues like seed oils, GMOs, and agri-chemicals, and Democrats are likely to face internal conflicts over those issues as well. Climate progress won\u2019t happen around energy as long as Trump is in charge, but it\u2019s at least conceivable and debatable around food.\nAt the very least, Trump\u2019s second term will offer an opportunity to fill in knowledge gaps that could come in handy the next time there\u2019s a president who actually wants to do something about global warming. Four years ago, a lot of us envisioned his story ending like Mastodon\u2019s ended in \u201c\u201c\nInstead, Trump\u2019s got more power than ever, and he\u2019s going to use it to block solutions to two-thirds of the climate problem.

(Landus)\nModern farming depends on massive amounts of ammonia fertilizer, almost all of it made from fossil gas in enormous chemical plants. These facilities use high heat and pressure to split that gas, mostly made up of methane, into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere, and the hydrogen is mixed with air, where it bonds with the nitrogen under high pressure via the century-old Haber-Bosch process.\nThe resulting ammonia is a carrier for the nitrogen that plants crave, but producing it this way is highly carbon-intensive, accounting for\nOutside the town of Boone, Iowa, startup\nTalusag\u2019s first pilot-scale facility in North America, built at a cost of about $512CEO\u201c\nTalusag has already started building a larger project in the nearby town of Eagle Grove, Iowa, that will be capable of producing up to 2015\nTwenty tons per day is a drop in the bucket compared to the roughly\n\u201c\n!Talusag's solar-powered green ammonia production facility in Boone, Iowa. Talusag's solar-powered green ammonia production facility in Boone, Iowa. (Landus)\nThat\u2019s fairly straightforward in the markets that Iwanaga and his team initially targeted. The startup launched in 2021\u201c\nBut even in America\u2019s agricultural heartland, Talusag can propose long-term contracts at set prices at or below the cost of ammonia shipped via pipeline from the Gulf Coast and then by tanker trucks to further-flung farms, Iwanaga said.\nThere\u2019s an important caveat to that, however. Talusag\u2019s ammonia is only cost-effective in U.S. markets if generous federal incentives for producing hydrogen with low or zero carbon emissions remain in place \u2014 a prospect that is looking increasingly uncertain.\n## Can small-scale green ammonia plants supply cheaper, more reliable fertilizer?\nTalusag\u2019s facilities use electrolyzers to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. The gas, commonly called \u201c is then fed into miniaturized versions of the gigantic Haber-Bosch reactors at industrial ammonia plants. That chemical process yields no greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 and if it uses clean electricity, it\u2019s completely carbon-free.\nThose green credentials are a nice \u201c\nLandus was first introduced to Talusag back in 2022\u201c\nThe Talusag offering \u201c\u201c\nIwanaga noted that Landus isn\u2019t taking on financial risk with these projects. Talusag pays for building and producing its green ammonia. That structure puts the pressure on Talusag to deliver on the quality and the low price it has promised to buyers.\nBut it also potentially provides the company with the long-term revenues it needs to secure project financing, rather than relying on equity capital. Talusag raised a\n## The economic balancing act for green ammonia in the U.S.\nShorter supply lines and fixed long-term prices are valuable features of Talusag\u2019s modular model for producing green ammonia. But Iwanaga conceded that the company\u2019s future in U.S. markets hinges on a key federal incentive that may not be around much longer \u2014 the 45 hydrogen production tax credit created by the Inflation Reduction Act.\nLast week, Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a reconciliation bill that calls for all but eliminating the federal clean energy tax credits created under the IRA2025\nTalusag\u2019s two projects in Iowa would squeak under that deadline, and the company may be able to start additional projects before year\u2019s end, Iwanaga said. But if the final bill does kill the 45 credit, that would rule out starting up any other U.S. projects for the foreseeable future, he said.\nRobin Gaster, research director at the Center for Clean Energy Innovation at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation think tank in Washington, D.C., noted that would-be commercial-scale producers of ammonia fertilizer made from green hydrogen face a tough road in U.S. markets.\n\u201c\u201c\nThe economics of green hydrogen production do not stand up on their own without subsidies like the 45 tax credit, he said. Today, hydrogen produced in the U.S. with fossil gas \u2014 referred to as \u201c12green hydrogen costs $5. \u201c\nCrowe noted that there\u2019s an important distinction between green hydrogen used to make ammonia for agriculture and green hydrogen that could potentially be used for industries such as trucking, shipping, and steelmaking. Farmers need ammonia now, and enormous quantities of gray hydrogen are already being used to produce it, while retooling industries like trucking and shipping to use hydrogen would require massive investments in new systems and infrastructure.\nThe on-again, off-again nature of U.S. clean hydrogen policy has made long-term commitments to green ammonia a tough sell. Some companies that announced ambitious plans to produce green ammonia in 20232024more stringent clean-energy tracking rules for the 45 credit than industry groups had hoped for. Cutting off the tax credit completely would make the economics of such projects even worse.\nIwanaga pointed out that Talusag\u2019s technology has some advantages over large green ammonia projects, however. For one, the company\u2019s modular systems can be manufactured and deployed in small increments, an advantage over gigantic chemicals facilities, so that exposes Talusag\u2019s investors to less risk, he said.\nTalusag\u2019s systems were also designed expressly to run on intermittent clean power, like the solar power serving off-grid or remote farms that were its initial target customers, he said. Most electrolyzer technologies don\u2019t perform as efficiently when they\u2019re forced to ramp up and down frequently to follow fluctuations in power supply. Talusag must deal with those challenges as well, but has incorporated several design features that minimize the efficiency losses, he said.\nTalusag\u2019s green ammonia technology isn\u2019t the only one designed to use solar and wind power when it\u2019s available. But being able to do that is a prerequisite not just for systems that rely on their own solar power, but also for grid-connected systems trying to capture the cheapest power available \u2014 which more and more frequently is also the cleanest.\nTake the wind energy that makes up an increasing share of the electricity flowing across Midwest power grids. Iowa is the second-largest wind power producer after Texas, 20232023\nWind farms produce when the wind is blowing, which isn\u2019t always when most customers are using electricity \u2014 and the more surplus wind power is available, the cheaper it is, Iwanaga said. That creates strong long-term prospects for using excess wind energy to make hydrogen, which could eventually make up for the absence of federal clean-hydrogen incentives, Iwanaga said \u2014 even if the economics aren\u2019t there yet.\nA similar concept has informed a 201320237\nRural electric cooperatives \u2014 member-owned and -operated entities that supply power to the most sparsely populated parts of the country \u2014 may also be interested in green ammonia projects that can capture the value of wind power that might otherwise need to be curtailed, Iwanaga said. \u201c\nGaster noted that access to cheap electricity could allow green hydrogen to compete economically with traditional ammonia production. \u201c\nIt\u2019s hard to say how the climate benefit of making green ammonia might stack up alongside the benefit of producing green ammonia locally, Iwanaga said. \u201c\nCrowe said that Landus hasn\u2019t yet considered the prospects of earning money from the carbon emissions prevented by buying Talusag\u2019s green ammonia. \u201c\nA correction was made on May 292025\n* Hydrogen\n* Clean energy\n* Midwest\n* Iowa\nJeff St. John is chief reporter and policy specialist at Canary Media.

    "content":"The state produces more clean energy than its grid can handle, forcing it to curtail the extra wind and solar power it can\u2019t use.

In those moments, the grid operator will order power plant owners to reduce their output. That\u2019s called curtailment, and it\u2019s common in places like California that have lots of renewables.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that California is having to curtail power as it adds more solar to the grid \u2014 but curtailments are rising faster in the state than renewable generation capacity is growing. Last year, curtailments jumped by 29202312\nCurtailments are at their highest in California during the spring, when the sun is strong enough to generate a lot of solar power but mild weather keeps air-conditioning use, and thus electricity demand, in check.\nWith power demand rising around the country thanks in large part to the rapid rollout of AI, and with\nThere are a few ways to do that. California can continue to push buildings, vehicles, and industrial operations to electrify, creating more demand to soak up what is now surplus solar. It can support the construction of interstate transmission lines that would allow it to export more power to states with less solar generation.\nThe state can also build lots and lots of batteries to store extra solar produced during the day for use in the evening. In fact, it\u2019s already doing that. It has installed more utility-scale storage than any other state, and the sector has grown rapidly in recent years: California had a total of 8GW2023\nIn order to stop wasting clean electricity, California will need to sustain that battery boom in the face of significant federal policy headwinds \u2014 and place some bets on other, more elusive solutions like transmission and long-duration energy storage.\n* Solar\n* Clean energy\n* West\n* California\nDan McCarthy is a senior editor at Canary Media.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\nUpvotesNewestOldest\nR\n0 points\n5 months ago\nInteresting article, but \"lots and lots of batteries\" needs discussion. Batteries are high capital cost items, and the capital cost must be paid off in annual loan repayments (with interest) of, say, $D\/year. If you use a 1 GWh output battery installation nightly, you get a storage added cost of $D\/365 per GWh, and you're (probably) in good shape. But if you're storing energy for a month or more, you're only using it 12 times per year or less, and the cost per GWh is at least $D\/12, thirty times higher! For any kind of long-term storage, we need much less expensive options. -Richard Leigh\nS\nSam Barro\n0 points\n4 months ago\nRichard, I mostly agree, but we do have a current technology, but that technology must be utilized within a top-down systems engineering approach. That technology is hydrogen (see my post elsewhere in this thread).\nG\nGeorge Walchuk\n0 points\n5 months ago\nCurtailment is inevitable with renewables, in particular for seasonal reasons. Solar for example can be 30% as effective in winter vs summer in many locations, so to handle winter with near 100% solar during the day, need three times the capacity compared to summer. And batteries are currently good only for several hours, no way suitable for seasonal storage. Currently there are no viable technologies for long term storage, and none on the horizon. Hydrogen is not viable less than 50% round trip efficiency and cost prohibitive ! If solar is cheap, best to just curtail !\nS\nSam Barro\n0 points\n4 months ago\nGeorge, You said, \"Currently there are no viable technologies for long term storage, and none on the horizon.\" Incorrect. Hydrogen gas storage in high pressure vessels can do it, and it's commercially available right now. Here's a short 4 minute video to explain the entire solution: A New Roadmap for Decarbonizing the US Economy:\nE\nEat till you weep\n0 points\n5 months ago\nNext month the Intermountain power plant comes on board and will soak up some of the solar that is being curtailed. The use will be the creation of green hyrdrogen to be used on the recently installed J power turbines that can burn hydrogen mixed with natural gas. 30% hydrogen mix to start. To facilitate the green hydrogen creation they will seek out cheap solar. It remains to be seen how this balances out.\nJ\nJackie\n0 points\n5 months ago\nThe solution to excess solar is notwaaaay\nS\nSam Barro\n0 points\n4 months ago\nJackie, I agree. The issue illustrates that we are wasting a lot of energy (no pun) and time by attempting a bottom-up, piecemeal approach to net zero. The quickest solution requires the use of existing technologies in a top-down systems engineering approach. If climate change is the profound threat to national security that scientists say it is, we need to do what we did to build the war machine for WWII. That was a top-down systems approach, as are virtually all engineering solutions.\nM\nMogens Lauritzen\n0 points\n5 months ago\nThe title should also include we are using more clean energy than ever! The installed battery base has gone from 0 to 15GW (45GWH) in just 5 years which has allowed us to use more PV energy. Yes, it is frustrating to see the regular PV curtailment, but I'm convinced we'll find a way to use the free energy aside from battery storage. Note, curtailment will remain a chronic choice while renewables are being added, and we are just at the beginning.\nJ\nJoseph Rizzi\n0 points\n5 months ago\nCA is 100% Total Solar or Renewables in some months? If you take curtailments into account maybe? So, why does CAISO not control\/commission batteries with Solar to daily offset usage? POWER political or organizational power not E. power is at play. \"We The People\" do not have control of these Monopolies enough for them to behave for the good of the PEOPLE instead of their $$$ investors.\nS\nSam Barro\n0 points\n4 months ago\nThere's no current battery technology that can provide the kind of energy storage that utilities require. Current storage is 4-hour storage, which is daily, or \"short-term.\" Utilities also require long-term - days of storage, and seasonal - months of storage.\nThe only current technology that can provide short-term, long-term, and seasonable is hydrogen, using high pressure hydrogen gas vessels (not underground salt caverns). But that technology requires a top-down systems approach (enhanced grid, pipelines, storage infrastructure, electrolyzers and fuel cells) in building the new green energy infrastructure. The current, piecemeal, bottom-up approach cannot utilize the enormous advantage hydrogen technologies provide. That's why hydrogen doesn't have a chance on the current marketplace.\nThe entire nation must address this issue with a centralized management that oversees a top-down systems approach, which is the approach taken by all engineering solutions to technical issues. This is what the nation did to build the war machine for WWII, to put a man on the moon, and in the Manhattan Project. The capitalist approach based on the marketplace was not capable of providing those solutions. The short 4 minute video explains one complete solution to our dilemna: A New Roadmap for Decarbonizing the US Economy:\nR\nRichard McCann\n0 points\n5 months ago\nAlmost all of this curtailment happens in the spring when loads are low and hydro generation is high. (And California has had 3 wet years in a row.) The solution is quite simple--turn off Diablo Canyon from Mar 1 to May 31 every spring. The amount of the curtailment is equal to about 3 months of Diablo generation which aligns with this solution. I wrote about this solution here:\nP\nPeter Grant\n0 points\n5 months ago\nThis is good news. With clean power generation ahead of the curve this allows focus on long term storage (lots of start and scale up in this space) and transmission (time to invest in infrastructure) as the demand picks up but also demand management via AI. Energy transition is not just moving from from hydrocarbons to electrons, it is also modernizing as we go. Keep going.\nD\nDanny W\n0 points\n5 months ago\nThis article does not correctly take into account the reasons for the curtailments. It assumes most of them are relating to insufficient demand, which is not always the case. CAISO reports curtailments as either \"Local\" or \"System\". System curtailments are due to the overall demand situation, as covered in the article. Local curtailments are due to congestion, though CAISO does not specify at what level the congestion takes place. In those instances, there is insufficient transfer capacity on the lines to allow renewables to meet demand on the system. Local curtailments are significant and are a growing portion of total CAISO curtailments. System-level solutions (untargeted storage) and shifting system demand won't help that much.\n## read next\n* ![Gray metal boxes lined up with a blue sky overhead ](\nBatteries\n### California has a new law to prevent big grid battery fires\n* ![Aerial shot of a large warehouse complex next to homes ](\nVirtual power plants\n### Can crowdsourcing help solve the data-center power crunch?\n* ![A large ship with cargo at a port ](\nMarine transport\n### Global rules to decarbonize ships delayed amid Trump\u2019s pushback\n* ![ ](\nPolitics\n### The DOE\u2019s loan office enters its \u2018energy dominance\u2019 era\n![](",

But how about attached to a raft, floating atop a reservoir?\nFloating solar photovoltaics, also called \u201cfloatovoltaics,\u201d is an emerging technology that\u2019s taken off in countries across Asia and Europe, especially near urban areas with limited space available for land-based solar.\nIt\u2019s also an untapped resource for the U.S. clean energy transition, 1476100\n\u201c10\nEven under the most conservative scenario the researchers considered, the potential of floating solar equals more than half of the solar capacity required for a fully carbon-free grid in the U.S. in 2050\nBesides minimizing land use, floating solar shades water bodies, which reduces evaporation and conserves limited water supply at reservoirs. Water also cools down the panels, making them\nBut so far, floating solar only makes up a tiny fraction of the U.S. solar market and is mostly limited to small-scale projects, including at a wastewater treatment plant in 89\nCompare that with projects like Thailand\u2019s \u201c10MW\nFloatovoltaics are often installed on reservoirs, water treatment ponds, and other human-made bodies of water, as currents, tides, and salt water\nThe NREL\nResearchers narrowed down which sites could feasibly host floating solar based on a range of technical criteria. For example, overly shallow reservoirs and those with strong currents were excluded. So were bodies of water located anywhere with extremely low temperatures, since projects typically cannot withstand high amounts of ice and snow.\nThe remaining federal reservoirs that could support floating solar are scattered across the country, with Texas, California, and Oklahoma taking the lead in potential capacity. More than half of the potential projects could generate between 10MW1123MW\nThe study didn\u2019t consider social, economic, or legal limits to developing floating solar, such as environmental regulations, the availability of transmission lines, and project costs. Those factors are \u201cNRELenvironmental impacts of floating solar is still nascent,\nBut this study adds to the growing evidence that floating solar could supercharge clean energy production.\nA 20182116GWNREL\u201c10\nNREL\u201c\n* Solar\n* Clean energy\nAkielly Hu is a freelance journalist and contributing reporter for Canary Media.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\nUpvotesNewestOldest\nD\nDavid Hrivnak\n2 points\n9 months ago\nAnother possible plus is many reservoirs are also hydro electric plants. So they already have infrastructure in place for the electricity and most dams have an exclusion zone keeping boats away from the dam. The floating solar can effective be that barrier and use the hydro as a partial battery back up. Cut back on hydro during sunny days and allow more flow on cloudy days and at night. So great utility at very little additional costs.\n## read next\n* ![Gray metal boxes lined up with a blue sky overhead ](\nBatteries\n### California has a new law to prevent big grid battery fires\n* ![Aerial shot of a large warehouse complex next to homes ](\nVirtual power plants\n### Can crowdsourcing help solve the data-center power crunch?\n* ![A large ship with cargo at a port ](\nMarine transport\n### Global rules to decarbonize ships delayed amid Trump\u2019s pushback\n* ![ ](\nPolitics\n### The DOE\u2019s loan office enters its \u2018energy dominance\u2019 era\n![](",

We can still draw useful lessons from it.\n![](\nBy Michael Grunwald\n4 June 2025\n* *\n!A large poster of Donald Trump's face under the words \"USDA\" hangs on the front of a government building\nA Trump banner hangs on the U.S. Department of Agriculture building in Washington, D.C., in May 2025. (Roy Rochlin\/Getty Images)\nThe \u200b\u201cEating the Earth\u201d column explores the connections between the food we eat and the climate we live in.\nFarms are a huge climate problem, so it was great that the Biden administration made a huge commitment to \u201c3\nThe Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program, launched by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in early 2022JBS135biofuels,\nFar too many grants went to scientifically controversial efforts to sequester carbon in farm soils through trendy \u201cUSDA\nI wrote a skeptical column about then-President Joe Biden\u2019s climate-smart approach back in 2022 so I had mixed feelings when the Trump administration cancelled the climate-smart commodities program this April. It was clearly a flawed program. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins had a point when she mocked it as slow and bureaucratic. While her primary complaint that it didn\u2019t send enough money directly to farmers wasn\u2019t my primary complaint \u2014 \u201c\nBut no one truly believes the program\u2019s cancellation had much to do with flaws in its design or execution. Its fatal flaw, from the Trump perspective, was obviously its climate-smart premise; Rollins slagged it as \u201c\u201c\u201cUSDA\nNobody who\u2019s concerned about the planet should be happy that an imperfect agricultural program was cancelled for the sin of trying to reduce agricultural emissions. As University of Iowa economist Silvia Secchi, one of the program\u2019s harshest critics, puts it, \u201c\u201c\nWhen President Donald Trump commits egregious transgressions \u2014 deporting a Venezuelan hairdresser to El Salvador or investigating the mayor of Chicago for bragging about his diverse staff \u2014 pundits often try to look balanced by criticizing the suboptimal behaviors he uses as excuses: Biden neglected the border; DEI\nWell, I spent the last six years reporting USDA\nBut I\u2019ve also pointed out that it\u2019s boring to harp on the badness of a climate-denial administration doing climate-denial things. And there are lessons we can learn from the politics and substance of the climate-smart partnerships \u2014 about mistakes that shouldn\u2019t be repeated, and at least one remarkable success story that should be expanded worldwide.\n## What is climate-smart ag? A federal experiment to find out is over.\nIn my book, I tell the tale of a big internal Biden administration fight over climate-smart agriculture that never made it into the public eye.\nOn one side was then-Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who wanted to pay farmers to adopt regenerative practices \u2014 like keeping soils covered and minimizing soil disturbance \u2014 that he believed would sequester carbon in their soils and help reverse climate change. He loved the idea of fifth-generation Republican dirt farmers who wore John Deere hats and drove Ford F-150\nOn the other side was White House climate aide David Hayes, who thought soil carbon was wildly overhyped \u2014 by the United Nations, environmentalists, foundations who seemed to cough up cash whenever they heard the word \u201c\u201c\nHayes was right about the science. It\u2019s extraordinarily difficult to measure soil carbon accurately or ensure it remains underground. It\u2019s also extraordinarily difficult to build more soil carbon without adding more nitrogen in the form of fertilizer or manure, which have negative climate impacts of their own. 2019\n\u201c\n!A person wearing a suit speaks into a microphone at a podium in front of a U.S. flag Biden\u2019s agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack (Alex Wong\/Getty Images)\nBut Vilsack won on the politics. Most of the climate-smart grants promoted regenerative practices designed to move atmospheric carbon underground and help build new markets where farmers could sell soil-carbon credits \u2014 and the same was true for another $20\nIf USDA4020\nHayes did pressure USDA300\nBut the Trump administration is cancelling those data-focused grants, too, part of its push to scrap grants that proposed to send less than 65\nThe Trump team also axed most of the grants focused on large numbers of small farms growing unconventional crops, because they required much more administration. For example, the Pennsylvania group Pasa Sustainable Agriculture lost a $5920002\n\u201c\u201c\nRobert Bonnie, Vilsack\u2019s deputy who oversaw the grants, says there was a political strategy behind the grant program: By offering farmers carrots rather than sticks, and helping them develop markets for climate-smart commodities regardless of their personal climate views, USDA\n\u201c\nAgain, it\u2019s not the Biden team\u2019s fault that the Trump team hates the climate. But just as many climate hawks now wish the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s clean-energy provisions had focused more on getting green stuff built quickly, and less on requiring union labor, American-made components, and other conditions unrelated to the climate, it\u2019s tempting to wonder what the climate-smart grants could have achieved before Trump ransacked them if they had focused on delivering quick emissions-reducing results.\nActually, we don\u2019t have to wonder, because a single grant amounting to just 0253\n## Soil carbon wasn\u2019t \u200b\u201c\nFour years ago, when a 23\nBut once he dug into the science and mechanics of soil carbon capture, Hull concluded it was mostly bogus. He calculated that farmers could at best sequester one-fifth of a ton of carbon underground per acre, so they would earn less selling credits than they would spend on seeds for cover crops \u2014 and since tilling the soil in the future would release the sequestered carbon, the carbon-credit agreements would prohibit any tillage on the land for decades.\n\u201c\u201c\nHull soon stumbled across an emissions-reduction opportunity that wasn\u2019t bogus at all: reducing methane from rice fields through better water management. Methane-producing microbes that thrive in flooded rice fields are responsible for 10\u201c\u201c\nAgriCapture received a $752022300002500091500005\nIf rice farmers worldwide all adopted these practices, they could eliminate enough emissions to offset half the aviation industry.\n\u201c\u201c\nRegenerative agriculture is sexy and popular, with support from Al Gore, Joe Rogan, Rosario Dawson, the Indian mystic Sadhguru, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but its ability to move a lot of carbon from sky to soil remains speculative at best. By contrast, AgriCapture\u2019s effort to reduce methane by reducing flooding on rice fields is simple, effective, and potentially lucrative.\nThere are also proven strategies to reduce methane from cow burps with feed additives, reduce nitrous oxide emissions by using fertilizer more efficiently, and store carbon above ground by planting trees and shrubs in pastures and fields \u2014 with climate benefits that are relatively easy to measure and monetize. The Biden team could have made an international splash by bringing those strategies to scale, if it hadn\u2019t been so excited about its soil-carbon experiment.\nNow that experiment is over, and that\u2019s Trump\u2019s fault.\nBut in the future, if policymakers who do care about climate progress want to make climate action more popular with the public, they might want to focus on actions they know will help the climate. And if those actions can create measurable environmental benefits that farmers can get paid for, they might even be popular in farm country.\n* Food and farms\n* Emissions reduction\n* Policy & regulation\n* Politics\nMichael Grunwald is a bestselling author and award-winning journalist who was a staff writer for The Washington Post, Time magazine, and Politico Magazine.

It didn\u2019t help that the Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act, with its many highly targeted tax credits for clean energy deployment and manufacturing, on a party-line vote.\n![]( States that reelected President Donald Trump in 2024 also host the lion\u2019s share of the domestic clean energy factories, which bring relatively high-wage jobs to their communities. (ACP)\nBut enough Republican representatives publicly argued against a wholesale repeal of the credits to give cleantech insiders hope. Indeed, the House Ways and Means Committee declined to eradicate the credits entirely in its budget proposal from last week. But the proposed tweaks to many of the individual programs narrow their scope and could render them wholly unworkable nonetheless.\n\u201c\u201c\nIn that light, the ACP\nThe manufacturing job count could grow to 57900020301340002024\nA Canary Media visit to the enormous QCells solar factory in Dalton, Georgia, last year showed why this work pays more than traditional manufacturing. The brand-new factories leverage considerable automation and robotic assistance for the heavy lifting and repetitive, high-precision tasks. Workers patrolled the lines and intervened when the machinery needed help. That greater output of an in-demand, high-tech product supported considerably higher pay than the carpet factories down the road.\n\u201c\u201cAI\nAcross cleantech factories, annual earnings from clean energy manufacturing averaged $11800076000\nIt\u2019s not just immediate employees who benefit, though. First comes the intensive but temporary construction phase. Once complete, the factories create additional work for support services in the region, such as shipping and delivery companies, food vendors, hotels for visiting customers, and waste disposal. Domestic manufacturing also relies on other component suppliers: Utility-scale solar panels sit on American steel trackers, covered in U.S.-made solar glass. The authors calculate that each job in a clean energy factory leads to three more in supporting industries.\n![]( U.S. energy-related factories have opened at a steady clip over the last four years, bolstered by growing demand and targeted industrial policies. (ACP)\nThis reality sounds a lot like the vision that Trump campaigned on last year, of growing jobs at home by restoring U.S. manufacturing from the ravages of globalization. He also repeatedly emphasizes a desire to secure more critical minerals for the U.S.; clean energy technologies provide much of the expected demand growth for those minerals.\n\u201c\u201c\nThe Ways and Means budget proposal dealt a blow to the cleantech industry\u2019s hopes for a predictable investment landscape.

However high efficiency does not mean heat pumps are cost effective. For example, in the Albany NY area, the average National Grid utility rates for electricity and natural gas for the three most recent heating seasons was 19.9 cents\/kWh and 83.2 cents\/therm, respectively. Based on those rates, the annual cost of heating with a heat pump that had a HSPF 4 rating of 11.2 (328% efficiency) was more than double (2.2 times) the annual cost of heating using a 95% efficient natural gas furnace. For the 2023-2024 heating season the annual cost of heating using that same heat pump was more than triple the annual cost of heating using that same 95% efficient natural gas furnace.\nJ\nJonathan Duffy\n0 points\n34 days ago\nWe converted to heat pump HVAC, hybrid hot water heater, heat pump clothes dryer and an induction stove.

(\nUtilities tend not to be big fans of rooftop solar, which eats into their revenues by reducing customer reliance on the power grid. A new Ohio lawsuit spotlights the tension between utilities and customers over the clean-energy technology.\nThe case deals with a monthly charge imposed by the city of Bowling Green\u2019s municipal utility on its few customers with solar panels on their rooftops. Customers who use batteries to store surplus solar power pay even more.\nResidents Leatra Harper and Steven Jansto claim the charge, which for them amounts to roughly $56\u201c37000\nThe city argues the fee is needed to make sure other customers don\u2019t subsidize those with rooftop solar. As households that produce some of their own electricity buy less from the utility, they pay less for fixed costs built into its retail rates, such as staffing, grid equipment, and maintenance. The utility would then look to other customers to make up the difference.\nThe situation echoes \u201c that have dogged rooftop solar around the nation. It could also be a preview of a statewide battle to come as the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio gears up to net-metering rules, which determine how solar owners are compensated for the energy they send to the grid. Municipal utilities like Bowling Green are not subject to these rules, but the dynamics around the fairness of rooftop solar rates are similar in either case.\nFor their part, Harper and Jansto installed rooftop solar panels and battery storage at their home in 20192020\n\u201c\n!Rooftop solar panels on a home against a cloudy sky Leatra Harper and Steven Jansto installed a rooftop solar array, pictured above, on their home about six months before the city of Bowling Green adopted a monthly charge on households with such systems.

There are US-made batteries, so they may not have to pay tariffs for imported batteries.\nThen that causes more pain for the utility because it has one less customer to pay for the operational cost of their grid.\nThere is a municipality utility in New York State that charges $8.00\/month even if you are off-grid.\nAt 2ndLife Batteries, we provide backup power for West African Hospitals, which suffer from blackouts from the grid. For example, a hospital experiences 4-hour blackouts every 2-3 days. That's equivalent to 17 days of 24 hours each day per year. Generators are used during blackouts. When they go off-grid with solar and energy storage, they consider the grid as a backup power source, not the primary power source, and they still have the generators as a third source of power source.\nAfrica will be develop because of microgrids, not transmitted thousand of miles of power lines.\nI mention the African experience not to belittle Harper & Jansto claims.

I've got a lot more solar generation and batteries than most, six Powerwalls and 21 kwh rated capacity generation. Cost? Around $220K before tax credits. I got 30% in tax credits (or will after the coming tax season) but future credits have been stolen. I cannot operate off grid. I can almost self power on an annual basis, but need grid as battery to do so - to the tune of 2.5 mwh. That is my annual \"solar season\" overproduction that I bank to grid and need back to get thru the winter season. 2.5 mwh, for those who aren''t aware, is a smaller grid scale battery module. I doubt I could achieve this with a doubling of my current system investment. Hard to justify, or to find a feasibile path toward. I've actually tried (at a lower level of effort, admittedly) to find and source supply and installation of this. I wholeheartedly support your efforts, what you are doing, and pretty much all you've posted, but if Harper and Jansto read it and begin to plot the path toward off grid living, they'll need to sell their current home and design their off-grid replacement from the ground up - from location, siting, design, supply, and builder, or a small scale EPC project, rather than buy a few more batteries and solar arrays.

That is, the expense of delivering electrons from the point of generation to the point of consumption. Utilities purchase electrons from owners of rooftop solar and move those electrons to the nearest point of demand - a neighbor's house next door or across the street. These electrons stay in the neighbrhood. The delivery distance is maybe 200 ft' and the delivery expense negligible. For example, the utility servicing my area, PG&E, pays $.05 per KWH for rooftop electrons, moves them maybe two hundred feet and charges my neighbor $.45 per KWH. A huge profit margin. Then, PG&E tries to equate the delivery expenses of those rooftop electrons with the delivery expenses of electrons it purchases from commercial wholesalers selling their electrons out in the desert or in Neveda, maybe 100-200 miles from the neighbor's house. The cost of delivering those electrons to my neighbor is vastly higher then the cost of delivering my rooftop electrons. PG&E makes a ton of money off my electrons which it could\/should pass on to its coustomers; instead it charges me a fee of nearly $13.00 per month, while alleging some sort of \"cost shift \" nonsense...\n![](\nGreg Ballantyne\n0 points\n4 days ago\nI am fortunate to live where there is full net metering. I pay a bit under $10 monthly to maintain a grid connection, for 10 billing periods annually. The remaining two billing periods, I buy and am charged for some grid power supply. The more households that do something like we have done, the more pressure is put on the status quo energy supply landscape. Across the US, grid operators and utilities are failing to respond intelligently to this pressure. It's a sad to see. This kind of response, to any pressures, rooted in expediency and ignorance, has become commonplace an is now being institutionalized in our Federal Government. The forces of Sanity must vote. If we are lucky, we'll get one more chance to do that - the upcoming midterm elections, if we fight for them. And fighting for them we will be forced into.

All the recently introduced Republican-backed bills would create this competitive structure by allowing third-party-owned projects where they were previously barred, the Coalition for Community Solar Access pointed out.\nCompanies that own shared solar installations pay property taxes that help fund local schools and emergency services. And these projects provide energy close to where it\u2019s being consumed, which can reduce the costs of building out grid infrastructure to deliver power to far-flung customers.\nPlus, community solar can help farmers keep their agricultural land in production.

The state has no sales tax or income tax, so government operations are funded mainly by hefty property taxes. It is also home to many small towns with constrained budgets.

We can understand the retail and wholesale prices, but coming to terms on what portions of transmission and distribution charges should be borne by back of the meter power producers seems impossible - see California, Hawaii, and now Minnesota. And for all of the people doing study after study after study, we don't get good information that can push us toward consensus on appropriate pricing.\nFrom my perspective (as a non-expert), it seems like (a) straight up net metering (banking a kw for providing a kw) doesn't work, (b) small producers are good because they are investing their own money and there is little permitting hold up, (c) the more clean energy production the better it is for low income households because air pollution tends to cluster in low income neighborhoods (of course that means, that polluting power sources are being shut down), and (d) small solar produces some benefits to the grid, but pricing those benefits is difficult. We also need better systems (not subsidies) for reducing the cost of fully installed solar.\n## read next\n* ![A Pila Mesh Home Battery atop a refrigerator in a home of one of Pila Energy\u2019s friends-and-family testers ](\nBatteries\n### The startup trying to make \u2018DIY\u2019 home batteries happen\n* ![Gray metal boxes lined up with a blue sky overhead ](\nBatteries\n### California has a new law to prevent big grid battery fires\n* ![Aerial shot of a large warehouse complex next to homes ](\nVirtual power plants\n### Can crowdsourcing help solve the data-center power crunch?\n* ![A large ship with cargo at a port ](\nMarine transport\n### Global rules to decarbonize ships delayed amid Trump\u2019s pushback\n![](",

Kowalski\n7 March 2025\n* *\n![](\nOpen Road Renewables held listening sessions last year for its now-scrapped Grange Solar project in Logan County, Ohio. (Courtesy of Open Road Renewables)\nMonths of proactive community engagement appeared to be paying off for the developer of the Grange Solar Grazing Center agrivoltaics project in central Ohio.\nOpen Road Renewables knew it faced an uphill battle before the state energy-siting board, whose recent deference to local opponents has helped make Ohio one of the most challenging places in the country to build large solar arrays. So the company showed up early and often in Logan County, listening to residents\u2019 feedback and committing millions of dollars in donations for community investments.\nAs public comments rolled into state regulators, the developer reviewed the submissions last month and found a clear majority of those weighing in supported its plan. The analysis filtered out hundreds of repeat comments, at least 14016\nOptimism around Grange Solar lasted only days, however. On Feb. 21\u201c\nOpen Road Renewables withdrew its application for Grange Solar late last week, making it at least the fifth large solar project in Ohio to be canceled over the past 15\nThe case highlights the power that local opponents have to block renewable energy projects in Ohio, even when they otherwise check all the boxes for regulatory approval. It also raises the question: What more can developers do?\nOpen Road Renewables held listening sessions last spring for its up to 500510\n\u201c\nThe section of the siting board staff\u2019s report that focuses on whether Grange Solar serves the public interest does not discuss local benefits. Nor does it address statewide public-interest issues, such as growing energy needs, efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and projected positive economic impacts.\nThe staff report also does not address conflict-of-interest issues and procedural problems raised by the developer about some of the local governments\u2019 filings. And it doesn\u2019t mention the company\u2019s analysis of public comments, showing that three-fourths of those who had commented on the project supported it.\nThe staff recommendation also does not consider the merits of opponents\u2019 reasons for not wanting Grange Solar to move ahead.\n\u201c\u201c\nRenewable energy developments face increasing headwinds across the country, often fueled by misinformation. Research released last June by Columbia University\u2019s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law identifies hundreds of projects encountering significant opposition 2024\nWithdrawing the Grange Solar application was a difficult business decision, Herling said in a phone interview with Canary Media. Management at the company felt it could have eventually won, if not at the Ohio Power Siting Board then perhaps on appeal. But even if the company did prevail, it had no guarantee on how long that would take. And Grange Solar is not the only site Open Road Renewables has been working on.\n\u201c\nThe Ohio Power Siting Board\u2019s staff report acknowledges that Grange Solar is exempt from terms in a 202152\n\u201c\n\u201c28\nOther stakeholders had very different reactions.\nThe regulatory staff\u2019s recommendation to block the Grange Solar Grazing Center \u201cIBEW32\nThe union also found fault with the local government leaders who opposed the solar farm. \u201c\n* Solar\n* Clean energy\n* Policy & regulation\n* Midwest\n* Ohio\nKathiann M.

The distribution grid data is critical and it is the most opaque part of our grids.\nI always assumed that the bill's author had to be involved in this type of last minute changes.\nThe appropriations phase of our Legislature is the least democratic part of it; no representation and no accountability.\nThanks for this great article.\nA\nArt Feierman\n0 points\n48 days ago\nSadly California has restructured (slashed) the pricing the big utilities pay solar rooftop owners (at least residential). This has resulted in a massive drop in new residential solar installations. Even if CA mandates new homes must have solar, there are so few new homes being built in CA (a pathetic number), that even requiring solar rooftops isn't likely to move the needle.\nHow badly is rooftop solar doing in California. perhaps ChatGPT, CA peaked in 2023, with the new rate structures brining about a 45% decline in added capacity for 2024. 2025 may be even worse. You have to go back to 2017 to find a year with less new capacity added, despite solar being a good deal more efficient today.\nAt least the sales of battery systems for residential has taken off, likely for the same reason, without the high payouts, and the ridiculously high California cost of electricity per kilowatt hour (over double the US average), solar owners would rather store the energy at home and rely less on SCE, PGE and SDGE in order to save a bundle!\nM\nMerry Nominal\n0 points\n50 days ago\nWhat\u2019s crazy is while I shop cost per kilowatt of grid connected versus non grid connected home batteries, and see I can easily get the minimum 10 kW a small home needs for emergency safety, at about half the cost of being grid tied ( less convenient use case but with inconvenient times in mind) I know I am wasting the value I could share to the grid. The aggressive VPP plans are out of style. So because of what you write, I can see it must be only the profit guaranteed to utilities rule, is the only rational reason why I have to waste my ability to use my own resources to contribute to others by sustaining myself. So this is why me as regular homeowner peak shifting ( and resilience planning) is a throw away value by entities that are set up to profit from unmet need. What planet can afford this kind of waste? Those charged with public good are being disincentivized by this rule of easy income stream. So this is why they wont buy my and my neighbors excess storage. So this is why DERs ability to aggregate is not helped or incentivised. So this sure looks to me like banking and profiting off of ignorance and profiting off maintaining and keeping the vulnerability of those vulnerable to both Outages and energy poverty. The point how simplest math shows they can\u2019t even build infrastructure fast enough and time and space limits the profit flow to the big through this drive a truck through it regulatory gimme. So That\u2019s what grants \u201c consumers\u201d wanting to consume less of the golden peak generation, our certifiable and insured roadkill status. This I\u2019ve really been wondering.

In fact, it could make ground-source heat pumps about as cheap as traditional HVAC\nOn Wednesday, Google X spinout 1500\nThe goal is simple, Kathy Hannun, Dandelion\u2019s founder and president, told Canary Media: \u201c\nJust being able to tackle hundreds of boreholes at a time should more than halve the drilling costs that burden existing home retrofits, she said. Large-project economies of scale and designing homes around the high-efficiency heating and cooling that Dandelion\u2019s system provides will yield further cost reductions, she said.\nAnd by eliminating the need for new gas pipelines and reducing the peak electricity demands on the power grid, subdivisions built on this model could save a bundle on utilities as well, she said. That\u2019s a key benefit cited in a January report from the Department of Energy, which\nThat study also found ground-source heat pumps could make a big dent in residential energy consumption and carbon emissions, particularly in climates where they outperform air-source heat pumps during cold winter weather.\nBut as it stands, the technology is in no more than 1now in about 13.\nThe chief barrier, once again, is the up-front expense. Dandelion has spent the past eight years\nTo break into larger volume deployments, Dandelion has an investor in Dandelion that now owns about 10\n## Colorado\u2019s push for geothermal energy\nLennar and Dandelion aren\u2019t disclosing cost data for the homes they\u2019re collaborating on in Colorado. But, Hannun said, \u201c\nThat\u2019s certainly the case in Colorado, where Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, has made geothermal energy, or \u201c\nOver the past few years, the state has passed legislation creating 2021to launch a Clean Heat Plan that will provide significant rebates to projects that improve energy efficiency and help customers switch from gas to electric heating.\n\u201c\nThe government and utility incentives will also lower costs for people who aren\u2019t buying these homes, because geothermal heat pump systems reduce the need for other utility infrastructure, he noted.\nAll-electric homes don\u2019t need new gas pipeline extensions, the costs of which are typically recovered through increases on the bills of utility customers at large. And ground-source heat pumps need much less electricity than air-source heat pumps to keep homes warm during the coldest hours of the year, since they\u2019re able to pull heat from deep underground thermal reservoirs rather than from cold outdoor air.\n\u201c\u201c\nPower grids are sized to meet maximum electricity demand, so buildings that can reliably keep electricity use below certain limits minimize the need to build more grid infrastructure. These factors can make geothermal networks the least expensive option on a system-wide basis when the lifecycle costs of infrastructure and energy consumption are built in.\nXcel Energy is looking for ways to mitigate growing grid costs as it seeks\n\u201c\u201c\n## Neighborhood geothermal energy options\nHannun isn\u2019t aware of other homebuilders embedding ground-source heat pumps into large-scale single-family construction, though they are being built into bigger buildings, including multifamily housing.\nBut there are similar, yet distinct, approaches for single-family homes to tap underground temperature reserves to save energy and cut carbon emissions.\nOne is thermal energy networks \u2014 projects that build the infrastructure needed for geothermal heat pumps at a campus-wide or neighborhood scale instead of serving just one home. Utilities in Massachusetts and New York are actively pursuing these projects as part of their states\u2019 decarbonization strategies. Six other states, including California and\n\u201c\u201c\nNewly built neighborhoods can also incorporate thermal energy networks. A 7500\nUnder a \u201c\nHannun agreed that shared thermal energy networks are an effective way to approach neighborhood-scale geothermal heating. But they\u2019re also more complicated to build and administer than individual ground-source heat pumps, particularly for entities that aren\u2019t a regulated utility with state-mandated authority to provide energy services to customers. Lennar and Dandelion opted for single-home ground loops to avoid any complications that could arise from getting lots of homeowners to commit to a shared system, she said.\nNot all homebuilders will embrace the additional costs of ground-source geothermal, she said. Developers don\u2019t pay utility bills, incentivizing them to choose the lowest-cost heating and cooling options available. At the same time, nationwide homebuilders like Lennar \u201c\u201c\nIt\u2019s also a straightforward way to meet state or local energy-efficiency building codes, she added.\nAir-source heat pumps are inherently more energy efficient than fossil-fueled furnaces, since they use energy to move heat from one place to another rather than to create heat directly. But ground-source heat pumps can be more than twice as efficient as air-source models.\n\u201cHVAC\u201c\n* Geothermal\n* Carbon-free buildings\n* Energy efficiency\n* Heat pumps\n* West\n* Colorado\nJeff St. John is chief reporter and policy specialist at Canary Media.

In particular, New York and Maine are driving the steep decline.\nDevelopers in New York, a mature market, are having trouble finding sites, paying higher permitting and land costs, and having to wait an average of nearly three years to get connected to the grid, making projects more expensive to develop, Connelly said.\nMeanwhile, in Maine, two regulatory changes are at play.

In June, legislators also passed \u201cpariah for investors.\u201d\nSome states, such as Virginia and New Mexico, also have caps on the size of their community solar programs that are limiting new developments, according to Connelly.\nAnd more federal turbulence could be ahead.\nThe Trump administration is also trying to claw back funding that would\u2019ve supported solar: the $7 and the $20, programs passed under the landmark Inflation Reduction Act.\n\u201c\nWhile this year is likely to be a rough one for community solar, Connelly sees growth returning in 20262027\nMassachusetts will open up its Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target program, SMART30150\nBut that growth is just a temporary reprieve.

Reality is indeed quite the opposite. Dirty quickly creates deep debt. Killing debt. It is staggeringly inflationary. It is imprisoning. The kind of debt that rushes toward and guarantees extinction. The avoidance of debt is freedom, and life.\nJ\nJim Lazar\n0 points\n3 months ago\nOnce homes are very energy efficient, the heating requirements in most climate zones are quite small, and a heat pump can provide both heating and cooling all year around. A heat pump water heater can provide the hot water.\nOnce homes are this efficient, it's not cost effective to pay for a second energy distribution system, for natural gas. And heat pumps always beat propane and heating oil in any cost-effectiveness test.\nThe 2021 code in Washington State is cheaper that gas up to about 2,000 square feet in size, even in the service territory of the most expensive electric utility (Puget Sound Energy). Above that, gas had a bit of an edge. But gas prices have gone up faster than electricity prices, so even that balance point is changing quickly. And, in the lower-cost public power service territories, gas cannot compete at any building size.\nYes, there are parts of the country where supplemental heating is needed for the coldest days. I like my gas fireplace, and it could easily be a propane fireplace, adding 30,000 BTU of heat when needed, with no gas distribution utility required. It also provides me with a grid-independent source of heat, which has been great during power outages.\nOnce the avoided cost of a gas distribution system is factored in, an all-electric heat pump home will be the obvious economical choice except in the service territories of the highest-cost electric utilities -- the private utilities in California, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Pretty much everywhere else, all-electric heat pump, or all-electric heat pump with a propane fireplace, will be the economic choice for consumers.\n## read next\n* ![ ](\nGeothermal\n### California can\u2019t get out of its own way on geothermal\n* ![Profile shot of a woman speaking into a microphone ](\nUtilities\n### Why utility regulators need to do more than call \u2018balls and strikes\u2019\n* ![ ](\nSponsored\n### The case for optimism in America\u2019s energy transition\n* ![Aerial shot of large warehouse surrounded by other buildings ](\nBatteries\n### In a first, a data center is using a big battery to get online faster\n![](",

Kaufman\n28 October 2025\n* *\n!Aerial shot of industrial complex\nA wind-powered, off-grid hydrogen production project in China (Yang Qing\/Xinhua via Getty Images)\nA new policy in China could ramp up the nation\u2019s production of green hydrogen for use in airplanes, ships, and other heavy industries, potentially eclipsing output of the fuel in the United States and Europe.\nEarlier this month, the National Development and Reform Commission \u2014 the high-ranking executive department in charge of economic planning \u2014 released what analyst Jian Wu called China\u2019s single \u201c2025\nUntil now, China has encouraged provincial governments and state-owned companies to develop hydrogen technology by providing lower electricity prices and loans and by setting production quotas. But unlike the United States and the European Union, the national government in Beijing had no overarching policy to directly subsidize low-carbon hydrogen projects.\nWhile the document published on Oct. 15\nFor the first time ever, the rules outlining which types of industrial projects qualify for national grants list green methanol, carbon capture, sustainable aviation fuel, and \u201c\u201c\nBy designating those sectors for direct grants under Beijing\u2019s central budget, \u201c\n\u201c\u201c\nThe move comes as the United States turns away from its nascent efforts to develop a clean-hydrogen industry. The landmark 45 federal tax credits meant to spur production and use of clean hydrogen, once slated to last until 2033phase out in two years as a result of President Donald Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The Trump administration, meanwhile, is poised to use funding meant for hydrogen-based steel projects to bolster production of steel made with fossil fuels instead.\nChina is already the world\u2019s largest hydrogen market, by far. At about 331832\nBy contrast, \u201c\nSince a portion of that byproduct hydrogen is vented into the atmosphere as waste, the new national grants could include projects that capture and repurpose more of that gas. But China\u2019s world-leading deployments of solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear power plants also generate an ample supply of clean electricity to produce green hydrogen \u2014 the version of the fuel made by blasting distilled water with enough electricity to separate hydrogen molecules from the oxygen ones. Already, in July, China agreed to sell a historic debut shipment of green steel made with hydrogen to buyers in Italy.\nDespite China\u2019s clean-energy advantage, the U.S. and European Union had, until now, boasted stronger national policies for developing domestic green hydrogen.\nWhile China\u2019s government-owned businesses invested in green hydrogen, \u201c45 tax credits in America\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act or the European hydrogen bank, said Anne-Sophie Corbeau, a hydrogen researcher at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy.\nFor example, Beijing backed fuel-cell vehicles, but the support came primarily as a reward for reaching manufacturing targets, not as direct subsidies, she said. The central government might give an annual reward of 16225\u201c\n\u201c\nThis month\u2019s policy shift will direct Beijing\u2019s funding hose at heavy industries that transition from coal and gas to hydrogen, including \u201c\n\u201c\u201c\nStill, Shen warned, \u201c\u201c\nBetween 2021202310020060\nIf central government funding accelerates in the next year or two as expected, \u201c\nThat could put the U.S. and Europe at risk of lagging behind China, just as they have with other steps in the clean-energy supply chain, experts say.\nCorbeau said the conditions are already there for China to dominate the industry. Once the federal tax credits expire, she said, \u201c\u201c\nShe noted that in Europe earlier this year, the regional hydrogen bank\u2019s second offering of a public subsidy for hydrogen tried to limit funding for projects that had too many Chinese components.

Energy storage dominates the queues of projects waiting to hook up to the grid in the next few years in places like California and Texas.\nThe Senate still needs to debate this proposal and see if it rallies enough votes to pass. Then the Senate and House will have to reconcile their differences. There\u2019s no way to know if the current Senate language will become the law of the land.\nNonetheless, this proposal changes the political landscape for clean energy advocates, by splitting clean energy into winners and losers. It also tacks on requirements around foreign influence that seem conceptually more workable than the House\u2019s \u201c, but that could still thwart actual construction.\n## Splitting storage from solar and wind\nThe idea of excluding wind and solar from receiving credits has been percolating over the last few months, though it was easy to miss in a generally turbulent news cycle. In April, U.S. Rep.

The language would block incentives for projects that include any components from a \u201c\nThe Senate shares the concern about tax credits accruing to Chinese companies, but handled it differently. In its version, the company filing for tax credits cannot be literally or effectively controlled by prohibited foreign entities \u2014 that\u2019s a test that U.S.-based developers should, in theory, have no trouble passing. But the text gets very specific on what kinds of arrangements could constitute \u201c\nAdditionally, developers must spend a certain amount of the total project cost on products that are not from \u201c402026\nOf course, tax credit compliance is the province of well-paid lawyers, who would need to translate the details of the Senate language into actionable legal guidance for companies.

Today, the Trump administration has winnowed civil service staff and actively opposed clean energy; it\u2019s hard to imagine IRS\nStorage developers are frantically running the numbers on whether their power plant designs can stay within the guidelines for foreign components, so that they\u2019ll qualify for the tax credits. They also need their financiers to feel confident that they will.

It\u2019s arguably the only dispatchable technology that can be built quickly in the next few years.

Then, from 20276600002024\n\u201c\nThe fund\u2019s annual revenue has ranged from less than $1419200720235945140000400000\nProjects like these would be at risk if the proposal to return renewable energy fund money to utility customers becomes a reality, Krakoff said. \u201c\nVose acknowledged that the plan for the fund would deprive some proposed projects of access to money, but said tackling high energy bills is more important right now. In addition, the renewable energy market has developed to a point at which it might not need as much support from state incentives anymore, he said.\n\u201c\u201c\nThe bill is now under consideration in the Senate. Supporters and opponents alike expect the Senate to remove the provision that funnels money out of the renewable energy fund, though that does not mean it will be completely off the table. It is possible the measure could be restored when the two chambers conference to resolve the differences in their versions of the bill, Vose said.\nOtherwise, it is probable the idea will return as a standalone bill at the beginning of next year, he said. It would likely be joined by another measure adjusting some of the requirements for renewable energy procurement by utilities and lowering the payments they make into the fund for noncompliance.\nThat, said Paul, is where these ideas belong: In their own bills, facing public scrutiny, rather than deep within a budget implementation bill.\n\u201c\u201c\n* Clean energy\n* Policy & regulation\n* Northeast\n* New Hampshire\nSarah Shemkus is a reporter at Canary Media who is based in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and covers New England.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\n## read next\n* ![A Pila Mesh Home Battery atop a refrigerator in a home of one of Pila Energy\u2019s friends-and-family testers ](\nBatteries\n### The startup trying to make \u2018DIY\u2019 home batteries happen\n* ![Gray metal boxes lined up with a blue sky overhead ](\nBatteries\n### California has a new law to prevent big grid battery fires\n* ![Aerial shot of a large warehouse complex next to homes ](\nVirtual power plants\n### Can crowdsourcing help solve the data-center power crunch?\n* ![A large ship with cargo at a port ](\nMarine transport\n### Global rules to decarbonize ships delayed amid Trump\u2019s pushback\n![](",

    "content":"The Trump admin is trying to claw back funding for low-income solar, but projects can still save residents money if local financing fills in the gaps.\n![](\nBy Jeff St. John\n27 August 2025\n* *\n!A solar system at Abrams Hall, an affordable housing building in Washington D.C., installed by Flywheel Development.\nFlywheel Development installed this 473-kilowatt solar system in Washington, D.C., at Abrams Hall, an affordable multifamily housing complex for older adults and formerly homeless U.S. military veterans. (Flywheel Development)\nThe Trump administration is making it harder for low-income households to access the money-saving benefits of solar \u2014 but hard doesn\u2019t mean impossible.\nThere\u2019s a lot for developers of affordable solar projects to navigate at the moment.\nThe Trump administration has clawed back billions of dollars in Inflation Reduction Act funding for projects serving low-income communities across the country, including $7\u201c. In July, the GOP-controlled Congress passed a sweeping law that will swiftly phase out the tax credits solar developers use to bring down costs. And for months now, the administration has held up $20 in federal green bank funding, which some organizations planned to use to make solar available to more people.\nClean energy supporters are opposing the Trump administration\u2019s freeze on green bank money in court and are expected to challenge the Solar For All clawback as well. In the meantime, the nonprofits and state agencies planning affordable solar projects with the money are left in limbo.\nStill, some developers are forging ahead.\nTake John Miller and Jessica Pitts as an example. The pair, which founded 201435175\nFiguring out a way to continue this work is crucial as energy costs rise even faster under Trump.\nRooftop solar is an effective way for households to reduce their electricity bills. But for a number of reasons, many low-income households can\u2019t install rooftop solar: They may not own their home, or if they do, the up-front costs might be too high or they could struggle to qualify for a loan. Meanwhile, solar power is a tough sell for most multifamily housing, particularly rental properties where landlords take on the cost of installing panels that primarily benefit tenants, who usually pay the lion\u2019s share of utility bills.\nCommunity solar projects like those developed by Flywheel and others can solve these problems. Low-income households are able to sign up to access energy from these shared installations, letting them tap into the benefits of the clean energy resource.\nIn places where community solar isn\u2019t available, multifamily properties can still use on-site arrays to reduce their utility bills. Those savings can be used to invest in cost-of-living upgrades, as can lease payments paid to properties that are hosting solar systems.\n## How Trump has scrambled affordable solar economics\nFederal action may not have completely foreclosed affordable solar aspirations \u2014 but in many cases, it has narrowed what\u2019s possible.\n\u201c\nEnterprise has deployed 76MW\nEnterprise had hoped to deploy 242032\u201c\nAnd although Flywheel is pushing ahead with its full project pipeline, the financial calculus has gotten tougher due to Trump\u2019s policy changes.

Enterprise has historically offered average savings between 205020\u201c50\nFlywheel earns a fairly good return on its investments, if not as lucrative as those possible from higher-end real estate projects, Pitts said. The company evenly splits its revenues with host properties for some of its projects, and accepts 30\nLosing federal tax credits will make solar projects more expensive, which will require lenders to adjust their expectations, but Pitts said she thinks their more community-focused financing partners, like the DC\n\u201c\n## Keeping the affordable solar work going\nA large part of why Flywheel can press on with its plans is its partnership with the local government.\nMuch of its work has been backed by payments from D.C.\u2019s 6288\nFinding lenders for these relatively novel solar projects was tough at first, said Miller. The company has primarily worked with CDFIs, which focus on underserved communities.\nIt also found a crucial partner in the DCgrowing number of \u201c that make clean energy, efficiency, and environmental remediation loans in communities that have been shunned by mainstream lenders.

Flywheel\u2019s D.C.-backed projects at properties like the 154\nThey\u2019ve also provided $425\nFlywheel is helping property owners put some of those proceeds toward energy-efficiency upgrades, Pitts said, which would slash utility bills even further.\nAt the Perrington Condominiums property in D.C., for example, Flywheel combined solar photovoltaic panels that meet about half the building\u2019s annual electricity needs with rooftop solar thermal systems to offset about 40\nEnterprise is encouraging its buildings to do something similar. The nonprofit is working on long-term solar power purchase agreements to hedge against rising utility rates in the region. \u201c\nAny savings Enterprise can achieve through solar PPAs can be put toward energy-efficiency investments. \u201c\u201c30\nPlowing energy savings back into properties is key to increasing the financial attractiveness of low-income solar projects to conventional lenders, said Sadie McKeown, president of Community Preservation Corp., a CDFICPC23000024\n\u201cCPC\u201d\nCPC7\u201c\u201c\nDriving down the cost of borrowing to pay for these kinds of sustainability investments is a critical step in reducing the need for incentives or subsidies to make them pencil out financially, she said.\n\u201c\u201c\n* Solar\n* Climate justice\n* Energy equity\n* Policy & regulation\nJeff St. John is chief reporter and policy specialist at Canary Media.

(Fervo Energy)\nGeothermal energy was spared in President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tax and spending law, which made deep cuts to incentives for other forms of clean energy.

Proponents say Buy Clean programs can play a crucial role in curbing planet-warming pollution from heavy industrial sectors \u2014 both by disincentivizing dirty operations and by spurring public and private investment in cutting-edge domestic factories.\n\u201c\nThe federal initiative also aimed to unify and build upon the patchwork of Buy Clean programs underway in a handful of states \u2014 including California, Colorado, and Washington \u2014 and to boost existing efforts by industry groups to compile and share emissions data. Many of these initiatives are expected to continue in the years ahead, though it\u2019s unclear how quickly and deeply they can transform industries on their own.\n\u201c\u201c\nOne particular initiative that launched under Biden, the Federal-State Buy Clean Partnership, 13\nThe U.S. industrial sector accounts for about significant sources of toxic air pollution in the communities where they operate.\nAmerica\u2019s earliest Buy Clean efforts began about a decade ago in California as a way to boost business for local steel producers, which were losing out on state contracts to Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper but more emissions-intensive metal. Today, the broader Buy Clean concept has evolved to include prioritizing materials made not just from cleaner conventional facilities but also from next-generation projects \u2014 including potentially steel mills fueled by green hydrogen or cement plants that use coral-inspired processes to curb CO2.\nThe federal Buy Clean strategy officially launched in December 2021\u201c452022IRA\nAbout half of that pie went to help the General Services Administration procure low-carbon building materials for construction and renovation projects.

The White House website has taken down many announcements and resources related to Buy Clean. It\u2019s unclear whether national databases on emissions inventories and product declarations will remain online and accessible, though the U.S. Climate Alliance said it will house and sustain work related to the federal-state partnership\n\u201c\u201c\nRescinding Buy Clean also adds uncertainty for the slate of new U.S. facilities that received federal funding to demonstrate novel, lower-carbon manufacturing methods.

Another approach \u2014 one that could gain more traction under the tariff-friendly Trump administration \u2014 could be to adopt trade policies that penalize imports of steel made in highly polluting overseas facilities. Making cleaner domestic steel \u201c\nAnd while the federal Buy Clean strategy was pivotal, Williams of the Center for American Progress said he expects that state agencies will keep broadening their own Buy Clean strategies to curb industrial pollution within their jurisdictions.

    "content":"The startup says it has cut drilling times and improved performance at its closed-loop geothermal system in Germany, which could produce power this year.\n![](\nBy Maria Gallucci\n28 October 2025\n* *\n![](\nEavor's closed-loop geothermal system in Germany is expected to produce 8.2 megawatts of electricity and 64 MW of district heating when fully completed. (Eavor)\nOn Tuesday, the Canadian company released results from two years of drilling activity at its flagship operation in Geretsried, Germany, giving Canary Media an exclusive early look. Eavor said the data validates its initial efforts to deploy novel \u201c\n\u201c\nEavor is part of a fast-growing effort to expand geothermal energy projects beyond traditional hot spots like California\u2019s Salton Sea region or Iceland\u2019s lava fields. The company and other firms \u2014 including Fervo Energy, Sage Geosystems, and XGS \u2014 are adapting tools and techniques from the oil and gas industry to be able to withstand the harsh conditions found deep underground.\nThe industry wants to produce abundant amounts of clean electricity and heat virtually anywhere in the world, and it could serve as an ideal, around-the-clock pairing to solar and wind power. But geothermal companies are only just starting to put their novel technologies to the test.\nEavor began drilling in Geretsried in July 2023\u201c2818\n![](\nAn illustration of an Eavor-Loop system, which harvests heat from deep in the earth. (Eavor)\nOperations on the first of four loops are nearly complete, and the startup plans begin construction on its second loop in March 20268264MW\nIn its new paper, Eavor said it encountered significant challenges in drilling its first eight of twelve lateral wells, which took over 10010000050\nFor example, Eavor said it successfully deployed an insulated drill pipe technology, which can actively cool drilling tools even as they encounter increasingly hotter conditions underground and helps to increase drilling speed. The adjustments also enabled Eavor to triple the length of time its drill bit could run before wearing out, further reducing downtime during the operation.\nOn top of cutting drilling time and costs, these improvements should also pave a path to boosting Eavor\u2019s thermal-energy output per loop by about 35\nThe Germany project will be the first commercial system of its kind when it starts producing power later this year. But other next-generation approaches \u2014 like the enhanced geothermal systems that Fervo is building in Utah and operating in Nevada \u2014 are also scaling up.\nEnhanced geothermal involves fracturing rocks and pumping down liquids to create artificial reservoirs. The hot rocks directly heat the liquids, which return to the surface to make steam. This approach is relatively more efficient at extracting heat from the ground, but it can also raise the risk of inducing earthquakes or affecting groundwater \u2014 though experts say that\u2019s unlikely to happen in well-managed projects. In places that ban fracking, like Germany, closed-loop systems can still move forward.\nBut the closed-loop design has trade-offs of its own, said Jeff Tester, a professor of sustainable energy systems at Cornell University and the principal scientist for Cornell\u2019s Earth Source Heat project. Namely, the pipes can limit the transfer of heat from the underground rocks to the fluids inside the pipe, which in turn limits how much energy a system can produce.\n\u201c\u201c\nVany said that Eavor\u2019s modeling shows its technology is already in line with the \u201c50100\n\u201c\u201c\n* Geothermal\nMaria Gallucci is a senior reporter at Canary Media.

Now, it\u2019s offshore wind turbines that are becoming artificial reefs for creatures from haddock to lobster.\n![](\nBy Clare Fieseler\n31 March 2025\n* *\n!Wind turbines rise out of the water against a blue sky.\nThe Burbo Bank offshore wind farm near Liverpool, England. New research finds that some fish congregate around turbine foundations in the waters off of the British Isles. (Christopher Furlong\/Getty Images)\nWhen ecologist Anthony Bicknell went looking for fish around the foundations of wind turbines a dozen or so miles off the coast of Scotland in the North Sea, he wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d find.\nBut he was ready for something surprising. Around that time, some European lobsters were catching researchers off guard by taking up residence in wind turbine foundations in the waters off of the British Isles. Sure enough, Bicknell and his team counted two more sea creatures that scientists had never documented congregating around wind turbines: a flatfish known as a dab and, most strikingly, haddock.\nHaddock is one of Scotland\u2019s highest-value commercial fish, ranking above cod and just below herring in total number of fish caught annually. Unlike cod, haddock don\u2019t usually hang out around shipwrecks and other human-made structures on the seafloor.\nThe discovery that these sleek silvery fish are utilizing wind foundations, described in\nOffshore wind is growing rapidly in some parts of the world, particularly in northern Europe and China, as nations look to complement other carbon-free resources like solar.\nIn the U.S., the industry has faced opposition from the fishing industry, environmentalists, and other anti-wind groups who have raised concerns about how turbines will affect marine life. False claims about offshore wind\u2019s impact on ocean animals \u2014 especially whales \u2014 have been spread by opponents including President Donald Trump, who issued an executive order on his first day in office that has slowed the industry to a crawl.\nThe new study from Bicknell, a senior research fellow at the University of Exeter, is the latest in a growing body of research that suggests offshore wind turbines, like other hard structures introduced to the seabed, can not only coexist with marine life but potentially benefit certain species.\nScientists have repeatedly found, for example, that an oil rig or oil platform can become an oasis of hard structure in ocean expanses devoid of much else but sand. They attract barnacles, shellfish, invertebrates, and, eventually, the fish that like to eat those creatures. An entire food web can grow.\nStudies like Bicknell\u2019s find the same phenomenon is playing out around some wind turbines installed on the seafloor of the North Sea. Except, unlike oil rigs, these massive pieces of infrastructure are helping to reduce the carbon emissions caused by burning fossil fuels, which is rapidly warming the ocean and devastating marine life worldwide.\nBicknell and his coauthors discovered that the older the wind foundation, the more fish \u2014 and sometimes bigger fish \u2014 like to call it home. This is true, they found, for many demersal fish like flatfish, haddock, and cod, which sit lower on the food chain. His team focused on the U.K. offshore wind farms known as Beatrice and Moray East; some of the studied turbines were built in 20172020\nThese studies also underscore that offshore wind farms are clearly changing the ocean. Scientists are still debating which species are most feeling the change.\n\u201c\nTake the case of the European lobsters that like to turn wind foundations into homes. In 2021\nFor haddock, the turbines are more like a buffet. Bicknell described the fish as enjoying what he and other scientists call \u201c\nSome of these discoveries are helping researchers in the U.S., where offshore wind has been slow to catch on. Five projects are actively under construction in the country, but only one commercial-scale offshore wind project, South Fork Wind, is in operation today. Meanwhile, the U.K. has over 4015GW\n\u201c\nRunde is part of an ongoing research project to understand how fish use two wind turbines installed off the coast of Virginia as part of a 20202026\n![](\nBrendan Runde holds an acoustic telemetry receiver during a February trip to Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, located east of Virginia Beach. When installed underwater, the device listens for tagged animals. (Ryan Tharp)\nDuring construction, wind farms could have negative effects on fish, said Runde.\nArtificial noise, changes to seafloor sediment, and newly laid cables that emit electromagnetic fields can all impact fish in the short-term. However, his team\u2019s research has found that the Atlantic sturgeon, an endangered species, and a variety of sharks are not avoiding the area even during ongoing construction.\nAt least 78 off the coast of Virginia, according to Dominion, while new ones continue to be built in spite of federal headwinds from Trump. In Virginia, offshore wind has a history of bipartisan support, and Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, is a vocal supporter of Dominion\u2019s 26176\nRunde\u2019s research is ongoing and must now endure a challenging political moment for the offshore wind sector. In addition to calling wind farms \u201cgutted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of staff and resources in recent months. Runde actively collaborates with NOAANOAA\nWhen it comes to measuring the long-term benefits of these structures, Runde and his team use some of the same methods as their British counterparts: baited remote underwater video, which measures fish abundance, size, and diversity at the pilot turbines. The foundations they explore can reach depths of 120\nBlack sea bass are already making homes out of these foundations.

(Clare Fieseler\/Canary Media)\nGary Yerman, 7550\n\u201c\n\u201c\nIt was an unlikely sight. America\u2019s fishermen have long treated wind developers as their sworn enemies.\nThe conflict started in the early 2000\nFew of these predictions have come to pass in places like the U.K., which has already built over 50habitat for haddock. But even today, fisher-led groups in the U.S. are spearheading lawsuits aiming to halt at least two offshore wind farms under construction on the East Coast. One former offshore wind executive told Canary Media that the amount of pushback from fishermen in America has made offshore wind investments riskier than in Europe.\nYerman was one of the first fishermen in the U.S. to cross this bitter divide. He\u2019s become the reluctant face of a group of over 100\nPursuing work in wind power has come at a cost. After the awards event, back in blue jeans and with a celebratory beer in hand, Yerman recounted the exact word New England fishermen used when he and his crew first crossed the Rubicon.\n\u201c\nThose tensions have become supercharged with the election of President Donald Trump, who has called offshore wind \u201c\u201c\u201c\nYerman and his crew are left wondering if the industry they\u2019ve bet their livelihood on \u2014 and work they\u2019ve risked their reputations for \u2014 will all come crashing down.\nMany of the fishermen who work through Sea Services voted for Trump. And if the president fulfills his promise to halt the industry, it would be devastating not only for the Northeast\u2019s climate goals and grid reliability \u2014 but for thousands of workers in the region, from electricians to welders to Sea Services\u2019 fishermen.\nOne of Sea Services\u2019 captains, Kevin Souza, put it simply: The impact would be \u201c\n## **\u201c**\nSix years ago, Yerman was like the others \u2014 angry with offshore wind developers, particularly Danish giant \u00d8rsted, which had set up shop in his hometown of New London, Connecticut.\nConcerned that wind turbines might push his son out of the scalloping business, he pulled one of the only levers he could think to pull and contacted his state senator at the time, Paul Formica, a Republican who owned a local seafood restaurant.\nFormica wanted to see the two sides get along. He arranged a meeting between Yerman and an \u00d8rsted executive named Matthew Morrissey, who happened to be a native of New Bedford, Massachusetts, the most lucrative commercial fishing port in America.\n![]( Offshore wind turbine blades sit in the staging area of the recently modernized Marine Commerce Terminal in New Bedford, Massachusetts, awaiting deployment in one of three offshore wind projects being actively built off the coast in spring 2025. (Clare Fieseler\/Canary Media)\nYerman found in Morrissey a sympathetic ear, and in turn, he listened to what the executive had to say \u2014 that \u00d8rsted was open to partnering with fishermen. Morrissey had seen, with his own eyes, fishers working for and coexisting with \u00d8rsted in a tiny port in Kilkeel, Northern Ireland. The energy firm had a team of about two dozen marine affairs employees, Morrissey relayed, who could help make something like that happen in America if Yerman was on board. He pitched it as a win-win.\n\u201c\u201c\nThe idea intrigued Yerman. In the U.S., profits from scalloping have fluctuated from year to year, and, following a crash in the 1990\nYerman got to work.\nHis first call was to Gordon Videll, a longtime friend and affable small-town lawyer, who knew things about contracts that Yerman didn\u2019t. The two flew to Kilkeel \u2014 on their own dime \u2014 to see the model for themselves. Videll noticed that some of Kilkeel\u2019s fishermen were driving cars nicer than his. He and Yerman were inspired.\nWhen they returned to Connecticut, Yerman recruited about a half dozen of his commercial fishing buddies, and Videll started putting together the paperwork. They dubbed themselves Sea Services North America and in 2021\n\u201c\u201c\nToday, Sea Services operates like a co-op and has brought 22CEO11\nIt\u2019s important work: making sure, for example, no fishing gear, like crab traps, is in the way of cables, monopiles, or survey operations. If necessary, Sea Services fishermen move gear \u2014 with the owner\u2019s approval. When not cleared, these obstacles have caused days and sometimes weeks of costly delays for developers, according to Morrissey.\nSea Services was an \u201cwhich went online last year and became America\u2019s first large-scale offshore wind project, wrote Ed LeBlanc, a current \u00d8rsted executive, in an email to Canary Media. The firm has since contracted the group for other projects, in no small part because of their expertise about local waters, he added.\nCooperation between these two sides \u2014 offshore wind and commercial fishing \u2014 does exist elsewhere in America. For example, Avangrid and Vineyard Offshore, the codevelopers of the Vineyard Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts, have\nBut Sea Services is unique.

More visibility could mean more Sea Services contracts.\n![]( Cofounders of Sea Services North America wait among gala attendees on April 29, 2025, to receive a Ventus Award from the Oceantic Network, one of America\u2019s largest offshore wind industry groups. (Clare Fieseler\/Canary Media)\nBut, right now, the Sea Services business faces headwinds that no award can help overcome.\nSince taking office in January, President Trump has launched an all-out assault on the offshore wind industry. On his first day in office, he halted new lease and permitting activity and called for a review of the nine projects that already had their federal permits in hand. In March, his Environmental Protection Agency chief revoked a key permit for Atlantic Shores, a fully permitted project that\nThe most eyebrow-raising step came in April, when Trump\u2019s Interior Department issued a stop-work order for Empire Wind 1had begun at-sea construction.\nIt was a wake-up call for Sea Services, which works for Norwegian energy giant Equinor on the project. Videll, Sea Services\u2019 CEO912\nIn May, the administration suddenly lifted the stop-work order. Sea Services\u2019 contract was safe, at least for the time being. But it was the most bracing illustration yet that the business, in spite of all its success, now faces very choppy waters under the Trump administration.\n## Taking a risk\nOn a cloudless late-February day at the New Bedford port, 5710\nThose 10\nThe hulking scalloping boat, with its ebony-painted hull and wood-paneled interior, was bustling ahead of the journey.

One time, he said a Sea Services fisherman was turned away from a Rhode Island dock, in what Yerman characterized as an act of revenge.\nThe hardest part of Yerman\u2019s job is overcoming this cultural aversion and getting fishermen to the table, convincing them that working for the offshore wind developers is a way to sustain a livelihood whose viability has begun to fade.\n\u201c\u2018\u2018\nThe lobstermen have a point regarding Trump. As frustrating as their remarks may be, the biggest threat to offshore wind is not snipes from colleagues, but the actions of a president who many Sea Services members \u2014 including Souza \u2014 voted for.\n![]( Captain Kevin Souza goes through a checklist on the Pamela Ann, a scallop-fishing vessel, docked in New Bedford, Massachusetts, preparing to go offshore in late February 2025.

Experts say that the federal permitting process for offshore wind in America takes too long \u2014 about four years. But, in the Northeast region, according to energy analyst Christian Roselund, finishing the deployment of the offshore wind projects already in the permitting pipeline will be much faster than starting up new nuclear or fossil-gas power plants.\n\u201c\u2018\u201c\nMost of the fishermen in New Bedford are Trump supporters, he insisted.

    "content":"Slow and complex permitting and interconnection rules drive up U.S. rooftop solar \u201c\n![](\nBy Jeff St. John\n23 July 2025\n* *\n![](\n(Justin Sullivan\/Getty Images)\nRooftop solar costs way more in the United States than it does elsewhere in the world. That\u2019s long been a headache for the sector to navigate. But now with Republicans in Congress killing off the decades-old tax credit for rooftop solar, it\u2019s a life-or-death problem.\nSo says Andrew Birch, a 25\u201c\nSome of those factors are under a solar company\u2019s control, like how much it spends on acquiring customers and managing projects. Others aren\u2019t, like the expense associated with navigating complex permitting and interconnection processes that differ from city to city and from utility to utility.\nThose costs rise when solar systems are accompanied by batteries, something that is becoming increasingly common as households look for backup power and respond to new incentive structures that prioritize storage, as is the case in California, the nation\u2019s largest rooftop solar market.\nBig upfront costs are the GOP30\nIn order for the U.S. to keep installing rooftop solar at a healthy rate \u2014 something that\u2019s key to combatting climate change and helping people manage rising electricity costs and electrify their cars and homes \u2014 the industry needs to figure out how to prevent costs from ballooning once the incentives disappear.\n\u201c\n\u201c\nBirch, a native Australian known as \u201c\nHe helped launch \u201cused by more than 160 across the U.S. to process solar permits in hours rather than weeks.\nThere\u2019s plenty of evidence that lowering these costs is possible: The soft-cost problem is a bit of a uniquely American phenomenon. In other places with high rooftop solar penetration, like Australia, the\nSolar companies in Australia can quote, sell, and install a 771400036000\n## Streamlining permitting at cities and counties\nWhen it comes to cutting soft costs, local permitting reform is a big target.\nPermitting regulations and processes vary widely across the roughly 23000SEIA\nSome do a good job of making the process smooth and straightforward. Others can be far less helpful and efficient. Slow or cumbersome permitting takes a toll on solar installers, stretching the time it takes to complete current projects and move on to the next.\n\u201cCEO\u201c\u2018\u2018\nIt\u2019s hard to standardize permitting across local authorities, which range from well-staffed big-city departments to tiny towns with one or two people working on it. But software that can reliably complete the tasks of permitting officials can save time and reduce errors for big and small permitting authorities alike.\nIn 2018SEIA2020dramatically sped up permitting without sacrificing quality, the platform was made available at large.\nAutomated permitting turns multiple back-and-forth processes into a \u201csimilar automated platforms from startups and from city permitting departments are now providing similar same-day options.\nThe advantages of instant permitting are so great, Cinnamon said, that he\u2019s stopped doing projects in cities and counties that don\u2019t offer some form of it. With less than six months to finish projects that can secure tax credits, \u201c\nThe next step is to expand instant permitting from hundreds to thousands of cities and counties by taking on statewide permitting reforms, said Nick Josefowitz, CEO\nOver the past several years, states including Democratic strongholds like\nReform looks different in every state. California set mandates for cities and counties to use instant permitting, while Texas and Florida required cities and counties to allow licensed and credentialed third parties to issue permits and conduct inspections on homeowners\u2019 behalf. Colorado\u2019s law backed off on mandates but offered incentives for local authorities to deploy instant permitting, while New Jersey\u2019s law would empower a state agency to set up instant permitting for cities and counties to use.\nLowering permitting costs can allow solar installers to cut their prices, which increases their business, spurs more competition, and gives households more options, Josefowitz said. A series of studies this year from Brown University\u2019s Climate Solutions Lab and the Greenhouse Institute found that streamlined and instant permitting in 22030100\nThe results are good not just for households and solar installers but for cash-strapped municipalities, said Elowyn Corby, mid-Atlantic regional director for nonprofit group Vote Solar, which advocated for New Jersey\u2019s newly passed reform bill.\n\u201c\u201c\n## Streamlining utility interconnection processes\nPermits aren\u2019t the only solar roadblocks. Utilities also need to approve solar and battery systems at homes connected to their grids before they\u2019re allowed to be turned on. Solar installers have long complained that\n\u201cCEO\u201c\nInterconnection rules are complicated, and utilities apply them differently. But reports from solar installers over the years have highlighted problems ranging from\nA lack of state regulator oversight for interconnection policies complicates efforts at reform, Josefowitz said.\nRegulators in some states like California set rules for all regulated utilities, but other state regulators don\u2019t. Even those that have set statewide guidelines for utilities have been slow to adopt rules that require them to put in place more streamlined processes or take the latest technology advances into account. A \u201c13\n\u201c\nExtreme amounts of rooftop solar can cause problems on power grids designed to carry electrons from big substations to customers.\n\u201c\nThat\u2019s why solar companies ranging from nationwide players like Sunrun to regional and local installers are recasting their business approach to include becoming \u201c\nOpportunities to earn money for these services are relatively scarce today. But with Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration making it much more expensive and difficult to build more renewable energy to meet the growing demand for electricity, utilities may be well advised to reduce the barriers to installing solar and batteries that can provide it, Mikkelsen pointed out.\n\u201c2\u201c\n* Solar\n* Policy & regulation\nJeff St. John is chief reporter and policy specialist at Canary Media.

    "content":"Amid political chaos, the company ditched long-simmering efforts to build a factory from scratch. Now, it\u2019s hunting for an existing plant where it can set up shop.\n![](\nBy Julian Spector\n7 February 2025\n* *\n!parking lot, blue sky and sleek, rectangular building\nAn artist\u2019s rendering of Kore Power\u2019s planned lithium-ion battery cell \"gigafactory\" in Arizona, which has now been cancelled. (Kore Power)\nLast week, energy storage startup 12working on for years. This revelation,\nAt the same time, founder and CEO\u201c\u201c\nSuch auguries rarely portend well for a startup breaking into a difficult, low-margin commodity business. It seemed, for a moment, that the U.S. was getting its own version of Northvolt, the Swedish company that filed for bankruptcy last fall after trying to build a fleet of battery factories in Europe and North America.\nBut Jay Bellows, who assumed the position of CEO\n\u201c\u201c\nRetrofitting an existing site could take around a year and a half if key resources like utility hookups are already in place, Bellows said. Besides speed to market, this new approach should \u201c\nWhy is Kore Power making this pivot now rather than setting out with this plan initially? Broader political trends may have something to do with it.\nKore Power spent the last three years pursuing a loan from the Biden administration\u2019s Department of Energy. Satisfying the DOE\u201csecured a conditional loan for 80850\nThe Loan Programs Office sprinted to finalize billions of dollars of loans in the last weeks of the Biden administration, but Kore Power\u2019s loan did not make it across the finish line. The Trump administration quickly froze all grants and loans for clean energy initiatives, dimming the prospects for any new loans going out the door.\nThus, Kore Power finds itself heading into the second Trump era without a hefty federal loan in its war chest. Construction costs are now higher than when Kore Power began factory development, Bellows noted. Meanwhile, Chinese producers have kept honing their craft, and battery-pack prices have tumbled lower than ever, ratcheting up the pressure on new U.S. battery aspirants.\nGiven the state of play heading into 202512CEO\u201c\nThe news dealt a blow to economic development plans in Buckeye, the city outside Phoenix that Kore had worked with for years to bring the factory to fruition. But Bellows was sanguine about the future of that site. Buckeye is growing at a rapid clip, he said, and the Kore Power land comes cleared for construction, with grid power and access to the highway.\n\u201c\nEven with an existing structure to work from, developing a battery factory is no walk in the park. The dearth of battery-cell production in the U.S. rules out the possibility of snagging a facility outfitted for that purpose, so Kore Power will have to find the best fit among the population of empty industrial buildings.\nBattery factories need specific width and height dimensions to accommodate cell production lines, said energy storage analyst Ravi Manghani, who tracks the industry\u2019s supply chain at data firm Anza Renewables. Utilities across the country are struggling to keep up with fast-growing demand from large industrial users, so to avoid lengthy grid upgrades to power the factory, the site needs to have housed some other ravenously energy-consuming activity.\nKore will also need to assemble a workforce capable of high-precision, highly automated battery cell manufacturing; the company had said it would hire 3000\n\u201c\nU.S. battery cells are still struggling to match the low costs out of China, even with tariffs and supportive tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, Manghani said. But Section 30110IRA\nManghani said the U.S. currently lacks any large-scale production for lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, the chemistry increasingly favored for grid storage due to its safety and cost advantages. But his firm expects two lithium-iron-phosphate cell factories to open this year. Kore Power won\u2019t be the first to reach that milestone but could follow in a couple of years if its revised plans work out.\n* Energy storage\n* Batteries\n* Clean energy manufacturing\n* Clean energy supply chain\n* West\n* Arizona\nJulian Spector is a senior reporter at Canary Media.

This path would relieve some pressure on utility customers in California, because funding grid upgrades through bonds is cheaper than doing so through energy bills.\nUtility costs have reached a boiling point in California, with customers of the state\u2019s three biggest utilities \u2014 Pacific Gas &&\nThe bills \u2014\nThe two bills have been passed by their respective legislative chambers.

First, California can borrow money at lower rates of interest than utilities can. Second, the state can spread out the costs over a longer period of time, and reduce the portion of costs borne in earlier years, compared to how utilities pass on the cost of capital investments to their customers, he said.\nIt\u2019s also been done before in California.

There the transmission is owned (and operated) by a national, regulated, company (red electrica de espa\u00f1a). Distribution is also a regulated monopoly (owner varies per region). But Retailing and Generation is deregulated. This seems a reasonable approach balancing regulation, monopolies, and competition.\nM\nMichelle\n0 points\n3 months ago\nThere should be no for profit utilty companies. Period. Thats the problem with this Corporatocracy. The utility companies created the issue when they failed to maintain their own infrastucture because they wanted to line their pockets instead. Not only should they never have been allowed to pass the expense on to the consumer, but they should have also received additional financial penalties via Court order, to be paid for out of their own profit. Hold these fucking Corporations accountable. They should only be allowed to raise rates or get state funding if they can prove it is critically needed and that they have not made any profit, otherwise all profit needs to be exhausted first. That has always been the normal cost of doing business until we apparently collectively decided to constantly bail these welfare lords out. The CA government, and the U.S. in general, seem to forget that the people rule, not the fucking Corporations. Grow a pair and tell them what they are going to do. Stop asking.\nR\nRobert Archer\n0 points\n3 months ago\nThe article states: \"The $15 billion securitization plan in SB 254 and AB 825 is targeted at reducing utility costs and rates in the shorter term.\"\nThe article quotes Vivian Yang: \"\u201cThese are big projects that are regardless going to take five to 10 years,\u201d she said. \u200b\u201cIt\u2019s not like we can pass those public-financing bills and then the next year our rates will go down.\u201d\nThe latter is correct. The basic premise of the article that the bills will reduce costs is wrong. They will possibly keep distant future rates from rising as much as they would otherwise but they do nothing to address the short-term affordability crisis. This is predominantly due to the CA government loading programs and costs onto the utilities such as fire programs, rooftop solar, energy efficiency, demonstrations, etc. All of these should be moved to the state budget where more of the cost of these programs would fall on higher income households.\nJ\nJeff Romek\n0 points\n3 months ago\nThe question is why do California utilities pay twice the average of the rest of the country for energy? Regulations for green energy put in place by the legislature. Did the author discuss root causes? Not really. Journalists and the legislature are just as useless and partners in crime. I expect the solutions to the problems they created will be just as bad. At the end of the day, if energy prices they created get too expensive, they'll want to socialize it and make us pay for it that way. Too predictable.\nJ\nJohn R.

Just stop forcing this \"carbon free\" rhetoric about made up climate change, and just start investing in domestic oil production and nat gas power plants. We need to gut this delusional \"clean\" corruption from our society; it's a scam by the elites, who are laughing at you morons for falling for their fake science and scam. More and more working class millennials are fleeing the state for affordable and welcoming conservative states that actually support the working class, and don't perpetuate these lies or burden them with absurd costs on energy and food. We need to cut off wasteful spending on this garbage AI hype, and stop falling for these obvious scams before the next Depression comes. As more and more working class members go hard right, we are going to vote you out, and we are going to undo all this damage from corrupt profiteers bleeding the state dry, and we going to tax the ever loving sh*t out of you yuppy profiteers that got rich on the backs of workers.\nE\nEat till you weep\n0 points\n3 months ago\n1. The first question the Gov. and the CPUC need to ask themselves is why do \"SOME\" (about 70%) California's pay more than twice the national average while the other 30% pay the national average.\nTo find the answer to number 1, they would need to ask question #2, which utilities serve those 70% of customers who pay such high rates?\nThe answer to number 2 is PG&E, So. Cal Edison, and SDG&E. These are all IOU's (investor owned utiliites). Municipal utilities in the State, such as SMUD, offer rates more than 50% less than the IOU's.\nThen one needs to ask question #3, which govt. agency regulates the IOU's?\nThat would be the CPUC.\nFor the past 10 years, the CPUC simply rubber stamps every request made by the IOU's. And the result is cost rising more than twice the rate of inflation since 2017. Prior to that rates were a bit higher than the national average, but not significantly, and they typical increase annually at the rate of inflation.\nAnd who appoints members to the CPUC? That would be the governor.\nThe fault lies 100% with the CPUC and governor who has the responsibility to appoint competent people and replace those who are incompetent.\n## read next\n* ![A Pila Mesh Home Battery atop a refrigerator in a home of one of Pila Energy\u2019s friends-and-family testers ](\nBatteries\n### The startup trying to make \u2018DIY\u2019 home batteries happen\n* ![Gray metal boxes lined up with a blue sky overhead ](\nBatteries\n### California has a new law to prevent big grid battery fires\n* ![Aerial shot of a large warehouse complex next to homes ](\nVirtual power plants\n### Can crowdsourcing help solve the data-center power crunch?\n* ![A large ship with cargo at a port ](\nMarine transport\n### Global rules to decarbonize ships delayed amid Trump\u2019s pushback\n![](",

What's holding back women from buying EVs? It's functionality, style, purchase price, and the perception of potentially being stranded. The design of most EVs to date has limited women's interest. 5 seats doesn't work for a large portion of the female driving population. For women who drive babies, kids, and\/or elderly relatives, the ease of getting in\/out of most EV models is not great. Many women drivers need to be able to seat 6 (or more!) people (comfortably). Yes, the purchase price needs to be reasonable $30K or less is what most drivers (of any gender) need (financing higher price vehicles is hard). A lot of EV models have looked pretty dorky to date, too, IMHO. That's changing. Kia and Hyundai are set to eat the Big 3's lunch. Chrylser's hybrid options are a great idea.\n![](\nMartin Voelker\n0 points\n5 months ago\nRe Rivians: I used to think that EVs are expensive to buy but this doesn't really apply to wealthy suburbia which are filled with SUVs and top trim minivans costing 60 to 90.000 dollars. Price really shouldn't be the deterrent for this target group, especially accounting for very low fuel and maintenance cost.\nK\nKristine Tague\n0 points\n5 months ago\nI have an EV and started wanting one back in the 90s (about when Lisa Simpson mentioned them). I saved up and am privileged enough to be able to buy one in the last few years. I love it and enjoy sharing my experience with others to show how easy it is to find a place to charge even when going camping to Oklahoma, and that it's getting easier to find charger stations. I live in a home I own and have a charger installed so I can plug in and enjoy not worrying so much about finding chargers around town or paying at a station unless I forget to charge.\nI have two young children and two large dogs, and the safety as well as the mass amount of storage space works well for me with the sports and activities my kids are into. I love the ability to pre-cool or heat my car, the seat heaters for all passengers, and the room in the back for the kiddos. I love the fact the car drops the seat and pulls up the steering wheel for easy entry when I get into my car, and then has a setting for my favorite seat position saved to my profile. I really also like the security cameras that record on parking that I can see from my phone, the use of my phone and watch as a key (yay no keys), as well as all the camera assists I get switching lanes on the crazy highways we have here in Texas. I like taking mine camping and being able to plug in to the RV park with an adapter, folding down the back seats and using that as our tent.\nI love that other manufacturers have started making more affordable and useable ev's in different styles. I'm not sure I like the styles, but they're better than those old prius ones with the wheels covered and collecting rust. l have coworkers who own the Kia and it's solid too. I have friends in apartments that would have to have access to a charger at or near their apartment or work to be able to have one. I think Hybrids are a good idea for those that cannot get to a charger consistently. I think seeing other women and talking about use of EVs for everyday use is a great idea and will build trust in these vehicles.\n## read next\n* ![A Pila Mesh Home Battery atop a refrigerator in a home of one of Pila Energy\u2019s friends-and-family testers ](\nBatteries\n### The startup trying to make \u2018DIY\u2019 home batteries happen\n* ![Gray metal boxes lined up with a blue sky overhead ](\nBatteries\n### California has a new law to prevent big grid battery fires\n* ![Aerial shot of a large warehouse complex next to homes ](\nVirtual power plants\n### Can crowdsourcing help solve the data-center power crunch?\n* ![A large ship with cargo at a port ](\nMarine transport\n### Global rules to decarbonize ships delayed amid Trump\u2019s pushback\n![](",

The company\u2019s technology can make the essential material without using any limestone \u2014 the carbon-rich rock that, when heated up in fiery kilns, releases huge amounts of planet-warming gases into the air.\nNow, Brimstone is looking to use its same process to supply another emissions-intensive industry: aluminum production.\nThe Oakland, California-based company sources carbon-free rocks that are widely available in the United States but are primarily used today as aggregate for building and road construction. Brimstone pulverizes those rocks and adds chemical agents to leach out valuable minerals. Certain compounds are then heated in a rotary kiln to make industry-standard cement.\nLast month, Brimstone a key ingredient in many clean energy technologies, such as solar panels, heat pumps, power cables, and electric vehicles.\nAlumina production today involves extracting and refining a reddish clay ore called bauxite from a handful of countries using environmentally destructive methods. The United States\nBrimstone says its approach could reduce or supplant the need to scrape bauxite from overseas mines, a process that generates copious amounts of toxic waste. Instead, the company aims to supply U.S. aluminum smelters by sourcing common calcium silicate rocks from domestic quarries and by using chemicals that can be more efficiently recycled than bauxite.\nThe strategy might also help the six-year-old startup navigate the fraught early period that many newcomers face when trying to break into giant, incumbent industries. Cement is a fairly cheap and abundant material, and the construction sector is inherently wary of deviating from tried-and-true \u2014 if carbon-intensive \u2014 practices. But the U.S. makes relatively little smelter-grade alumina, despite the essential role it plays in the country\u2019s economy.\n![]( A Brimstone employee prepares molds for casting samples using what the company calls \"deeply decarbonized cement.\" (Brimstone)\n\u201cCEO\u201c\u201c\nThe company, which has raised more than $60Portland cement \u2014 the product that comprises the vast majority of cement made today \u2014 and 378\n## Tariffs, funding turbulence ensnare aluminum production\nBrimstone is expanding its scope during an especially dynamic period for the aluminum sector.\nIn recent decades, U.S. aluminum producers have significantly reduced domestic production in response to spiking energy prices and increased competition from China.

Geothermal was at about 1-2%. the rest largely was dominated by \u201cnatural\u201d gas (about 40%), and coal was already on the decline. The solar numbers have since tripled to almost 5-6% since the passage of the inflation reduction act and the wind numbers unfortunately have been stuck in place (guess what happens when tax credits don\u2019t stay fixed at one level for a long time horizon\u2026). But here\u2019s the kicker: the states that produce the most wind and most solar are not blue states \u2014 Texas leads the pack, with a staggering 25-30% of electricity in the state being supplied by wind power alone and about 8% coming from solar power. If it were its own country, Texas would dominate the renewable percentages on that chart.\nB\nBill Bugbee\n0 points\n4 months ago\nAs for national clean energy grid numbers, all the countries mentioned should be commended, yet no mention of USA.\nSo here it is: In the first four months of 2025, wind and solar combined provided 20.3% of the total US electricity generation, up from 18.5% in early 2024. In April 2025, wind and solar accounted for 24.6% of total US electrical output. Solar alone provided over 10% of national output in April 2025. For full-year 2023, wind contributed 10.2% and solar 3.9% (utility-scale) of US electricity generation. Including small-scale solar, the total solar share is higher, as noted in the 2025 data above.\nI installed rooftop PV (8KW) to our grid-home activation in Jan. 2014, and later added two Tesla Powerwall (10 KWh) batteries in 2019. Since that time, we have been fully grid-independent, which now serves mainly as a large capacity back up for our home in case of an internal system failure -- which has also have happened.\nThe grid service failures totaled 20 separate outages events over the past 12 months, 17 of those service failures \"each\" lasted less than one hour. During that same period 3 separate service outages were greater in duration than one hour, the longest service outage lasting 4 hours in duration. Cable\/landline services went dark during the grid failures, while our internet fiber service was unaffected. At home would we have never known there was a power issue, as our home microgrid performed exactly as it was designed, i.e. to be fully grid-independent in the event of a service failure.\nR\nRichy Ainsworth\n0 points\n4 months ago\nThe report referenced doesn't break the UK out into its individual countries so Scotland is not specifically mentioned and probably should be \"renewable electricity generation is now equivalent to approximately 97% of Scotland\u2019s gross electricity consumption\"\nP\nPete McAvoy\n0 points\n4 months ago\nYou forgot Uruguay.

(Brett Coomer\/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images)\nThe U.S. solar energy industry has succeeded in doing something that would have been hard to imagine a few years ago: It has officially built more than enough factories to meet the country\u2019s demand for solar panels.\nThe nation can now produce 40GW reported in late 2024SEIA202050GW2030\nThe factory buildout employs workers across the U.S. in high-tech manufacturing roles and diminishes reliance on China, the long-time leader in solar manufacturing. But solar panels, which industry insiders refer to as modules, are just the last step of the solar supply chain: Currently, U.S. factories assemble modules from solar cells that are almost exclusively produced overseas. Those cells, which convert sunlight into electricity, incorporate wafers that are meticulously sliced from silicon ingots; factories that make ingots, wafers, or cells are more complex and capital-intensive than module assembly plants.\nThose precursor steps have lagged behind the U.S. module buildout, but companies have pledged to build factories for 56GWSEIA\nIn November, legacy solar manufacturer Suniva kicked off the first new domestic cell production since U.S. producers (2010ES5003GW\nFive more cell factories are under construction, per SEIA33GW1GW\nBut President Donald Trump swiftly attacked his predecessor\u2019s investments in clean energy, signing an order on his first day in office to \u201c\nSome companies are thus holding back on solar-cell factory investments until they see what the Trump administration does with a key manufacturing tax credit, which has proven vital to secure construction loans.\n## Cell factories require much bigger investment than panels\nThe rebirth of U.S. solar manufacturing had to start somewhere, and assembling panels made sense as that first step. Now, all those panel makers could become anchor customers for the next link in the chain \u2014 the proposed cell manufacturers. But making that jump isn\u2019t so easy.\nTake the case of Heliene, a company based in Ontario, Canada, that nonetheless has established its bona fides as a committed U.S. solar manufacturer.\nHeliene opened a solar-module factory in Mountain Iron, Minnesota, back in 201780032052013GW\nIn November, when previously bankrupt Suniva began the first U.S. cell production in years, Heliene swooped in to purchase every cell Suniva\u2019s new factory could make. Heliene could, for the time being, tout its products as the only U.S.-built modules filled with U.S.-built cells.\nNow Heliene is working on its boldest move yet: a $200CEO\nBuilding a cell factory requires a significant step up in dollars and complexity compared with a module-assembly plant, Pochtaruk explained. Putting panels together is a largely mechanical task that costs around $30\nSolar-cell production costs more than four times that, at about $130\u201c\nCell production exposes silicon wafers to chemicals in liquid and gaseous forms, which must unfold in precisely calibrated environments, Pachtaruk added. Water used in the process requires treatment before it can be reused or sent to the sewer. The equipment to do all these things drives up costs relative to module assembly and makes permitting more complicated.\nThat raises the stakes for anyone looking to put their chips on the table for American solar-cell production \u2014 even if they\u2019ve already found success in their panel-assembly bets. The prospects of financing these bigger bets are intimately tied to the future of federal manufacturing tax credits, part of the Biden policies that Trump has vowed to dismantle.\n## Tax credits unlock financing for pricey cell factories\nEven successful solar manufacturers typically don\u2019t want to fork over their own cash for the hefty expense of a new cell factory. They turn to lenders to finance construction costs. But lenders have a hard time loaning money to a type of business without much of a track record to evaluate, and the current U.S. cell-manufacturing landscape is mostly nonexistent.\nCell manufacturers have something else going for them, though: the 45 tax credit. As enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act of 202245 awards a set amount of money for each key solar component that a company makes in the country in a given year. If the manufacturer doesn\u2019t have enough tax liability to absorb all that credit, it can sell the credits to another entity, generating cash to pay down debt or invest in further expansion.\nHeliene pulled that off last fall with 45 credits from module production and\nFinancial institutions mulling a $10045 credit as collateral, Pochtaruk said. Future cell sales may be hard to predict, but a guaranteed payout based on the number of cells produced is easy to model (at least in a world where the U.S. government honors legally binding contracts and pays its obligations).\n\u201c\nThe potential loss of tax credits may be less consequential to companies like Qcells, which can draw construction funds from its corporate parent, Korea\u2019s Hanwha. A smaller solar-focused company like Heliene doesn\u2019t have other corporate coffers to rely on in lieu of tax-credit\u2013based financing.\nIt\u2019s still entirely possible that the credits will survive. Under normal circumstances, it would take a new act of Congress to undo them. A cadre of Republicans in Congress has publicly urged leadership to preserve them, based on the economic benefits they bring to their districts. Meanwhile, SEIA100\nThe current uncertainty, though, is at the very least delaying the commitment of more private funds to build solar-cell factories. Those projects \u2014 and the high-tech, well-paying manufacturing jobs they come with \u2014 could collapse altogether if the situation persists or Congress undoes the recently created tax credits.\n* Clean energy manufacturing\n* Solar\nJulian Spector is a senior reporter at Canary Media.

That\u2019s a big problem.\nHow can utilities plan grid and power plant investments for the AI\n![](\nBy Jeff St. John\n25 February 2025\n* *\n![](\n(Binh Nguyen)\nThis is the second article in our series \u200b\u201c _Boon or bane: What will data centers do to the grid?\u201d_\nThere\u2019s no question that data centers are about to cause U.S. electricity demand to spike. What remains unclear is by how much.\nRight now, there are few credible answers. Just a lot of uncertainty \u2014 and \u201c\nUtilities in major data center markets are under pressure to spend billions of dollars on infrastructure to serve surging electricity demand. The problem, Koomey said, is that many of these utilities don\u2019t really know which data centers will actually get built and where \u2014 or how much electricity they\u2019ll end up needing. Rushing into these decisions without this information could be a recipe for disaster, both for utility customers and the climate.\nThose worries are outlined in a AI\u201c\u201c\u201c\nSeveral uncertainties make it hard for utilities to plan new power plants or grid infrastructure to serve these data centers, most of which are meant to power the AI\nAIAI2024AI\nIt\u2019s also hard to figure out whose data is trustworthy.\nCompanies like Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, and xAI each have estimates of how much their demand will balloon as they vie for AIAI\nThese uncertainties make it nearly impossible for utilities to gauge the reality of the situation, and yet many are rushing to expand their fleets of fossil-fuel power plants anyway. Nationwide, utilities are planning to 20\nIf utilities build new power plants to serve proposed data centers that never materialize, other utility customers, from small businesses to households, will be left paying for that infrastructure. And utilities will have spent billions in ratepayer funds to construct those unnecessary power plants, which will emit planet-warming greenhouse gases for years to come, undermining climate goals.\n\u201c\nSome utilities and states are moving to improve the predictability of data center demand where they can. The more reliable the demand data, the more likely that utilities will build only the infrastructure that\u2019s needed.\n## A \u200b\u201c\nIn recent years, the country\u2019s data center hot spots have become a \u201c20202024\u201cU.S. transmission grid challenges, hosted by trade group Americans for a Clean Energy Grid. \u201c\nA December enormous load-forecast growth in data center hot spots, from northern Virginia\u2019s \u201c\n![]( (\nKoomey highlighted one big challenge facing utilities and regulators trying to interpret these forecasts: the significant number of duplicate proposals they contain.\n\u201c\u201c\nIt\u2019s hard to sort out where this \u201c\nTo make things more complicated, local forecasts are also flooded with speculative interconnection requests from developers with land and access to grid power, with or without a solid partnership or agreement in place.\n\u201cAECOM\nThat puts utilities in a tough position. They can overbuild expensive energy infrastructure and risk whiffing on climate goals while burdening customers with unnecessary costs, or underbuild and miss out on a once-in-a-lifetime economic opportunity for them and for their community.\n## Getting a grip on what\u2019s coming onto the grid\nIn the face of these risks, some utilities are trying to get better at separating viable projects from speculative ones, a necessity for dealing with the onslaught of new demand.\nUtilities and regulators are used to planning for housing developments, factories, and other new electricity customers that take several years to move from concept to reality. A data center using the equivalent of a small city\u2019s power supply can be built in about a year. Meanwhile, major transmission grid projects can take a decade or more to complete, and large power plants take three to five years to move through permitting, approval, procurement, and construction.\nGiven the mismatch in timescales, \u201cAECOM\u201c\nKoomey, Das, and Schmidt highlight work underway on this front in their February report: \u201c\u2018\nSome utilities are still failing to better screen their load forecasts, however \u2014 and tech giants with robust clean energy goals such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are speaking up about it. Last year, \u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\nUtilities also have incentives to inflate load forecasts. In most parts of the country, they earn guaranteed profits for money spent on power plants, grid expansions, and other capital infrastructure.\nAs a matter of fact, many utilities have routinely \u201c\n## Making data centers pay \u2014 and promise to stick around\nIn the face of this gap between what\u2019s being demanded of them and what can be built in time, some utilities are requiring that data centers and other large new customers prove they\u2019re serious by putting skin in the game.\nThe most prominent efforts on this front are at utility American Electric Power.

Policies aimed at forcing developers to prove their bona fides may also need to consider what those data centers do with their power.\nTake crypto mining, a business that uses 0623\nCrypto mining operations are also risky customers. They can be built as rapidly as developers can connect containers full of servers to the grid and can be removed just as quickly if cheaper power draws them elsewhere.\nThis puts utilities and regulators in an uncomfortable position, said Abe Silverman, an attorney, energy consultant, and research scholar at Johns Hopkins University who has held senior policy positions at state and federal energy regulators and was a former executive at utility NRG\n\u201c\u2018\u201c\nTaking aim at individual customer classes is legally tricky.\nIn North Dakota, member-owned utility Basin Electric Cooperative asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for permission to charge crypto miners more than other large customers to reduce the risk that gigawatts of new \u201c\u201c\nSilverman noted that AEP\nIt\u2019s likely that the industry, boosted by its influence with the crypto-friendly Trump administration, will challenge these kinds of policies elsewhere.\n## The hunt for realism amid the AI\nThen there\u2019s AI\u201cAI\nSuch forecasts include those from McKinsey, which has AI2030\nBut these forecasts rely on \u201c\u201c\nGood forecasts also must consider hard limits to growth.

(Justin Sullivan\/Getty Images)\nJust over a year ago, the world\u2019s first commercial hydrogen ferry officially set sail in the San Francisco Bay, offering a clean, quiet rebuttal to the noisy, polluting ferries that many coastal cities depend on.\nNow, the vessel\u2019s owner is working to build a bigger, faster version in New York.\nSwitch Maritime was recently 150202812\n\u201cCEO\u201c\nMore than 600\nSome of the nation\u2019s biggest ferry operators \u2014 including those in New York City, San Francisco, and Washington state \u2014 are starting to test and deploy cleaner marine technologies to meet their climate goals and improve air quality in waterfront communities.\nLast month, New York City launched a $33 that uses batteries and diesel generators. A handful of other hybrid and fully battery-powered vessels are operating or under construction nationwide, and hundreds more have hit the water in China and Europe.\nFor now, Switch\u2019s San Francisco ferry is the only fully hydrogen-powered vessel in the U.S.\nThe boat, called Sea Change, launched in July 20247536060010246\nThe New York ferry will be twice the size and operate twice as fast as Sea Change, said Seamus Nolan, Switch\u2019s director of commercial and government affairs. He said the $2\nJust as crucial as launching the ferry will be establishing a hydrogen supply chain for this specific project, given that no such networks exist today in the U.S. maritime industry. Nolan said that Switch has identified three potential suppliers of green hydrogen \u2014 made from renewable energy sources \u2014 that could initially serve the new vessel\u2019s operations, though future supplies could include hydrogen made from nuclear or methane pyrolysis as those production methods scale.\nA lack of cheap, clean hydrogen remains one of the biggest barriers to taking fuel-cell ferries mainstream. It\u2019s also a key reason why ferry operators are primarily turning to battery-powered boats to begin greening their fleets. Hydrogen fuel is substantially more expensive to make and transport than diesel fuel, and producers remain reluctant to ramp up supplies \u2014 and thus drive down prices \u2014 given the uncertainty around customer demand.\nThis was already true under the Biden administration. Now the second Trump administration is moving to scrap federal policies meant to accelerate production of clean hydrogen, including by potentially 7hastens the phaseout of the 45 tax credit for clean hydrogen production.\n\u201c\nDuring the Sea Change trial in San Francisco, the vessel experienced \u201c\nFrom July 20242025\nHall said the ferry operator is evaluating the demonstration\u2019s results, which will help inform its longer-term plans.

Hamilton has been taking classes at night since fall 2022 while working as an electrician for Got Electric. He graduated in May with two associate degrees and a handful of certifications for work on heating, ventilation and air conditioning, electrical, and solar equipment. (Ben Earp\/Ben Earp Photography)\n_Powering Rural Futures:This five-part series from the Rural News Network explores how industry, state governments, and education systems are training this growing workforce._\nWhen Mason Taylor was getting ready to graduate from high school in 2022\nTaylor grew up in the town of Dryden in rural Lee County, in the westernmost sliver of Virginia between Kentucky and Tennessee. He had come to love the electrical courses he took in high school because there was always something new to learn, always a new way to challenge himself.\nDriving to Tennessee for work would likely mean two hours commuting each day.\nTaylor, now 21\nA summer apprenticeship learning how to install solar arrays helped him get on-the-job training and opened up connections to local work.\nA regional partnership working to add solar panels to commercial buildings in the region aims to train young people as they go, developing workforce skills in anticipation of increasing demand for renewable energy-focused jobs in the heart of coal country, where skill sets and energy options are both changing.\nVirginia ranks eighth in the nation for installed solar capacity, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, but so far, major renewable energy projects have been clustered in the eastern and southern regions of the state. Increasing the popularity of solar power in the far southwestern corner of the state depends in part on the availability of trained workers like Taylor.\nAndy Hershberger, director of Virginia operations for Got Electric, said the electrical contractor firm has had an apprenticeship program nearly since the company\u2019s founding.\nThe company, which has about 100402012\nMore recently, the two companies began working to set up a training program that was more focused on solar. The catalyst was the former superintendent of Wise County schools, a school division that had signed up to put solar panels on its facilities. The superintendent saw the installation as an opportunity to get his students hands-on work on a renewable energy project.\nApproximately three dozen apprentices have signed up for the program since 202213\n\u201c\nOn top of hourly pay, apprentices get free equipment and a transportation subsidy, along with nine community college credits at Mountain Empire Community College, which provides classroom training before students step onto the job site.\n\u201c\nHe was in the 2022\nHe got a job offer from Got Electric at the end of that summer.\nThis summer, Secure Solar Futures and Got Electric will join forces again to install more than 1600\nThe 777\nHershberger said he sees interest in solar growing.\n\u201c\nMountain Empire Community College offers solar training as a standalone career studies certificate or as part of its larger energy technology associate degree program.\nIn Southwest Virginia, a solar installation project is more likely to consist of adding panels to homes and businesses rather than building the large, utility-scale ground-based facilities more commonly seen in Southside Virginia, said Matt Rose, the college\u2019s dean of industrial technology.\nOn a larger project, a single worker might have a specialized role, performing the same task across a large number of panels. On a smaller project, a worker is more likely to be involved in more aspects of the job.\n\u201c\nLast year, 10\nRose said the college\u2019s students typically start out making $1718\nNationwide, the median salary for electricians is about $61000\nIn Lee County, population 2200042000\nThe number of solar installers in Southwest Virginia is unclear. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn\u2019t collect data on employment by technology, so residential solar installation companies are labeled as electrical contractors, along with all other electrical businesses, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.\nTony Smith, founder and CEO2022\nSmith said it\u2019s tough to replicate the apprenticeship program at various school divisions. Doing so requires the work of individual school systems and the regional community colleges, instead of being able to pick up the curriculum from one area and apply it at the next project site.\nAnd all the partners \u2014 Smith\u2019s company, participating schools and installation firms \u2014 face some uncertainty for each project. It\u2019s challenging to pinpoint the timing of projects so that students have the time to participate during the summer months, he said.\n!A person in a suit and sunglasses stands in front of solar panels on a rooftop Tony Smith, founder and CEO of Staunton-based Secure Solar Futures, speaks with media at an April event to celebrate Roanoke City Public Schools\u2019 first phase of solar array installation on six facilities.

Hamilton\u2019s solar experience has come in handy on recent installation projects at a poultry farm and at a YMCA\nHamilton continued going to school at Mountain Empire and graduates this month with two associate degrees in energy technology and electrical. He\u2019s also earned a handful of certificates in solar installation, air conditioning and refrigeration, and electrical fabrication, among others. With the nine credits he earned in the summer apprenticeship, he \u201c\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy journey, though.\nHe said he usually started his day around 693045\nHe\u2019d like to stay with Got Electric and start preparing to take his journeyman\u2019s license, which requires at least four years of practical experience on top of vocational training, plus an exam. From there, he\u2019s got designs on moving up in the company and eventually becoming a master electrician.\nOn April 14650000PVC\nTaylor uses similar skills at work each day. But his work site looks a lot different from Hamilton\u2019s.\nIt has taken Taylor some time to figure out how to stick close to home while working in his trade. He spent a year working with Got Electric immediately after finishing his summer apprenticeship, then left the company to work as an electrician in a local school system. He eventually returned to Got Electric for a few months, working at Virginia Tech putting solar on three buildings on campus in Blacksburg, three hours from home.\nHe discovered he didn\u2019t like traveling for installation jobs that meant night after night in a motel room.\n\u201c\nNow he\u2019s an electrician at a state prison in Big Stone Gap. He has the same shift every day, in the same place, and drives 10\nTaylor has also taken additional classes at Mountain Empire and wants to go back this fall to finish his associate degrees in HVAC\nRose, the dean at Mountain Empire, noted that once major solar projects are done, maintenance doesn\u2019t require ongoing jobs, and most students who receive training in solar installation typically make it part of another job, such as being an electrician.\n\u201c\nRose predicts interest in solar will grow as more homeowners and business owners look for ways to offset rising electric bills.\n\u201c\nEnergy independence, he added, fits with the character of Southwest Virginia.\n\u201c\u201c\nThis reporting is part of a collaboration between theInstitute for Nonprofit News and Canary Media, , and .

They\u2019re also the worst structure for heat pumps, Malinowski said.\nWhen utilities charge the same per-kilowatt-hour rates at all hours of the day, they ignore the fact that it costs more to produce and deliver electricity during certain hours. That\u2019s because, like a water pipe, the power grid needs to be sized for the maximum flow of electrons \u2014 even if that peak is brief. Meeting it requires the construction and operation of expensive grid infrastructure.\nFlat rates spread the cost of these peaks evenly across the day rather than charging customers more during the high-demand hours that cause a disproportionate amount of grid costs.\nBut heat pumps aren\u2019t typically driving peak demand \u2014 at least, not for now while their numbers are low.

In most states, electricity usage waxes in the summer \u2014 when people blast their air conditioners \u2014 and wanes in the winter, when many residents switch to fossil-fuel heating.\nSome utilities offer reduced electricity prices in winter to drum up business, a structure that benefits households who heat their homes with electrons.

To me, this seems more like a regulatory problem than anything else. But is there a chance to make real progress on VPPs? What are the barriers? My understanding is that we should get away from feed in tariffs (which I understand as payments made to small providers without regard to time of day) and move to a system based on actual prices. While this favors battery + solar, it also seems like the system we need. We should also remove barriers that fail to recognize the benefits solar (or S + battery) provide to the grid (which California, and to a lesser extent Hawaii, seemed to have implemented). And we should reduce barriers (and therefore costs) to installing solar + battery systems so that they can be economically efficient without the need for subsidies.\nE\nEduardo Pelegri\n0 points\n3 months ago\nI agree. Using real total cost (generation + distribution + transmission) and applying it to both imports and exports solves many problems.\nTurns out that the California Public Utilities Code has required this since 2001.

They see the industry\u2019s implosion as a chance to avoid plowing billions of dollars into a technological dead end. Many climate advocates have dismissed hydrogen as a guise for fossil-fuel interests to prolong the use of their planet-warming product; they won\u2019t be shedding any tears now.\nBut for the contingent of hydrogen entrepreneurs who emerged from successful renewables firms, the sudden loss of momentum delivers a yearslong setback in efforts to clean up heavy-duty transport, steelmaking, and other industries that are hard to decarbonize, and a missed opportunity to head off the worst impacts of climate change.\n\u201c\nThe sudden vaporization of the imagined green hydrogen economy may be the kind of healthy correction this market needed. Whichever hydrogen projects ultimately get built could prove more durable for having made it through the ringer after the days of easy money.

The sun creates plasma by compressing and heating hydrogen to tens of millions of degrees, and it performs the miracle of fusion by confining that hydrogen, along with its variants, with its mammoth gravity.\nHumans hoping to recreate the conditions of the sun on Earth have to rely on exotic magnets, Brobdingnagian laser-beam arrays, or other maximalist techniques.\nThese complex and expensive fusion machines compress and confine plasma in an attempt to bring two nuclei close enough to overcome their repellant electrostatic forces and fuse together. A successful, sustained fusion reaction would heat up a material surrounding the reactor, allowing it to boil water and drive the same sort of conventional steam turbine you\u2019d find in a coal, gas, or traditional nuclear (fission) power plant.\nMost of the fusion startups Canary Media has covered \u2014 such as Avalanche Energy, and own (unproven) method for controlling the plasma and wringing out the heat.

The devices provide up to 800780000\nHere in the U.S., though, there is no market for balcony solar. Ward, a Republican state representative in Utah who learned about the tech last year, wants that to change. The way he sees it, this is an obvious solution to \u201c\u2018\u201c\nHis colleagues agree. Earlier this year, the Legislature unanimously passed a bill he sponsored to boost the tech, and Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed it. \u201c\nUtah\u2019s law marks the nation\u2019s first significant step to remove barriers to balcony solar \u2014 but bigger obstacles remain. Regulations and standards governing electrical devices haven\u2019t kept pace with development of the technology, and it lacks essential approvals required for adoption \u2014 including compliance with the National Electrical Code and a product safety standard from Underwriters Laboratories. Nothing about the bill Ward wrote changes that: Utahans still can\u2019t install balcony solar because none of the systems have been nationally certified.\nThese challenges will take time and effort to overcome, but they\u2019re not insurmountable, advocates of the technology said. Even now, a team of entrepreneurs and research scientists, backed by federal funding, are creating these standards. Their work mirrors what happened in Germany nearly a decade ago, when clean energy advocates and companies began lobbying the country\u2019s electrical certification body to amend safety regulations to legalize balcony solar.\nIn 2017VDEVDE\n\u201cVDE20182019\nThe regulatory structure has continued to evolve. Ofenheusle has worked with other advocates to amend grid safety standards, create simple online registration for plug-in devices, and\n!Solar panels on a balcony with a roof. A potted plant is also on the balcony. Balcony solar systems feature one or two small photovoltaic panels and a microinverter and generate enough power to charge a laptop or power a small fridge. (Tobias Schwarz\/AFP via Getty and Grist)\nMeanwhile, the United States has yet to take the first step of creating a safety standard for the technology. U.S. electrical guidelines don\u2019t account for the possibility of plugging a power-generating device into a household outlet. The nation also operates on a different system that precludes simply copying and pasting Germany\u2019s rules. The U.S. grid, for example, operates at 120230\nWithout proper standards, a balcony solar system could pose several hazards.\nOne concern is a phenomenon called breaker masking. Within a home, a single circuit can provide power to several outlets. Each circuit is equipped with a circuit breaker, a safety device within the electrical panel that shuts off power if that circuit is overloaded, which happens when too many appliances try to draw too much electricity at the same time. That prevents overheating or a fire. When a balcony solar device sends power into a circuit while other appliances are drawing power from the circuit, the breaker can\u2019t detect that added power supply. If the circuit becomes overloaded \u2014 imagine turning on your TV\nThis was a concern in Germany, so it developed standards that limit balcony solar units to just 800\nAnother issue in the U.S. is the lack of a compatible safety device called a ground fault circuit interrupter, or a GFCIGFCIGFCI\nSome people have raised concerns about the shock risk of touching the metal prongs of a plug after unplugging a balcony solar device. German regulators accounted for that by requiring the microinverter \u2014 which converts currents from the panel into electricity fed into the home \u2014 shut down immediately in an outage or when it is suddenly unplugged. Most of them already have this feature, but any U.S. standard will likely need to formalize that requirement.\nThe lack of an Underwriters Laboratories, or UL\u201cULUL\nWhile some companies have sold plug-in solar devices in the U.S. without a UL\nAchim Ginsberg-Klemmt, vice president of engineering at the plug-in solar startup 2023UL\nGismoPower sells a mobile carport with a roof of solar panels and an integrated electric vehicle charger. Unlike rooftop solar, the system doesn\u2019t need to be mounted in place but can be rolled onto a driveway and plugged in, generating electricity for the car, house, and the grid. \u201c\nGismoPower\u2019s product avoids one of the biggest technical challenges with balcony solar by plugging into a dedicated 240UL\u201c\nOne major sticking point is that any standard must comply with the National Electrical Code, a set of guidelines for electrical wiring in buildings that does not allow for the installation of plug-in energy systems like balcony solar. The rules are issued by the National Fire Protection Association, a nonprofit trade association, and adopted on a state-by-state basis.\nThe code is updated every three years, with the next iteration due later this year for the 2026\nJeff Sargent, the National Fire Protection Association\u2019s staff liaison to the National Electrical Code committee, said that this is the first time the organization had received public comments about plug-in solar systems. For now, it cannot consider amendments to allow their use until a compatible ground fault circuit interrupter exists, he said. Once that\u2019s available, he said, the association can ensure that outdoor outlets can be safely used for balcony solar.\nElectrical standards are constantly evolving, and it often takes more than one cycle of code changes to allow for new products, said Sargent. Ginsberg-Klemmt said his group will continue to pursue other avenues to amend the codes.\nUntil that happens, a UL\u201c\n* Solar\n* Carbon-free buildings\n* Clean energy\n* Distributed energy resources\n* West\n* Utah\nAkielly Hu is a freelance journalist and contributing reporter for Canary Media.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\nUpvotesNewestOldest\nB\nBruce Parker\n0 points\n6 months ago\nEven the small solar array associated with my van could be a source of a small bit of electricity on most days.

Here are lessons food and farming can learn from the rise of renewables and cleantech.\n![](\nBy Michael Grunwald\n31 July 2025\n* *\n!Silos and a barn next to a wind turbine on a sunny day\nA wind turbine alongside farmland in Wisconsin (Scott Olson\/Getty Images)\n_The \u200b\u201cEating the Earth\u201d column explores the connections between the food we eat and the climate we live in._\nThese days, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s frustrating and depressing to spend your time thinking about energy and climate issues. Global coal use hit an all-time high last year. So did greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. Now President Donald Trump and his Republican lackeys are maniacally rolling back America\u2019s clean-energy progress, sledgehammering renewables while subsidizing pollution.\nIt\u2019s awful, I know.\nBut just think how frustrated and depressed those of us who spend our time thinking about food and climate issues must be.\nOn energy, there\u2019s at least progress for Trump to roll back. On food, there\u2019s been virtually none. On energy, the world at least knows what it needs to do \u2014 electrify the global economy and run it on clean electricity \u2014 even if it\u2019s not doing it quickly or consistently enough. On food, the world isn\u2019t even sure what it needs to know, and the problems are quickly and consistently getting worse.\nThat\u2019s why I wrote my new food and climate book, \u201c303\nThe book covers dozens of promising food and climate solutions \u2014 including some I wrote about for Canary, like this bad-ass super-tree, this eco-friendly bio-fertilizer, high-yield pastures, and high-tech food. The bad news is that none of them have achieved the kind of scale necessary to make a serious dent in emissions. But 20nearly all new U.S. power plants are zero-carbon, while electric vehicles look like the future of transportation.\nThe additional bad news is that we\u2019re losing a soccer field\u2019s worth of forest to agriculture every six seconds; we\u2019re on track to lose another dozen Californias\u2019 worth of forest by 20502082050\nIn other words, food needs to get where energy is now in a hurry. So what political lessons can the food world learn from two decades of energy progress?\n## The government has to help\nThe first lesson of the energy transition is that it has required public investment. The U.S. government\u2019s national labs, scientific grants, and other R&\u201c\nThe Biden administration did start investing in climate-friendly food and agriculture solutions, such as\nBut the Trump administration is undoing Joe Biden\u2019s green agriculture initiatives, and in any case they were orders of magnitude smaller than the rivers of cash cascading into green energy. That\u2019s a big reason why food and land solutions are off to such a slow start, and why private investment is lagging as well; for example, the cultivated meat industry has attracted $3500\nObviously, the U.S. government won\u2019t invest in climate solutions as long as Trump and the GOP\u201c\u201c\nA corollary to that lesson is that governments should let a thousand flowers bloom, investing in all kinds of potential alternatives to the status quo. In my last book, \u201c200990\nOh, there were plenty of losers. The most famous was \u201c\u201c. But the green stimulus helped jump-start America\u2019s photovoltaic solar industry and start driving down the price of silicon panels, which is why Solyndra\u2019s and Ivanpah\u2019s more expensive approaches to solar faltered in the marketplace. The stimulus also created a domestic electric-vehicle battery industry, while helping wind power and LED\nIt\u2019s also important for governments to act on what they learn, rather than continuing to invest in the flowers that fail to bloom. The classic example of throwing good money after bad in the energy space is farm-grown fuels; there\u2019s still bipartisan support for giving the farm lobby the destabilize the climate. Biden was a vocal cheerleader for corn ethanol, and Trump\u2019s Big Beautiful Bill, while obliterating tax credits for truly clean energy,\nThe Biden administration\u2019s first $3didn\u2019t love its focus on scientifically dubious efforts to sequester carbon in farm soils, it did seed an\n## All is not lost\nLike I said, it can get frustrating and depressing.\nTo meet those 2050\nSo yes, change will be extremely hard. But energy\u2019s biggest political lesson for food is that change is possible. Two decades ago, wind and solar power were global rounding errors, a documentary called \u201c\nOne confounding example: all the confident pronouncements about carrots and sticks. Yes, Obama stimulus goodies helped jump-start the energy transition, while taxes and other restrictions on agricultural pollution in Europe inspired farmers to blockade highways with tractors and dump manure on government buildings. (One American pollster told me meat taxes were the least popular government policy idea he\u2019s ever surveyed, \u201cISIS\nWhat does seem to be as true for food as energy is the clich\u00e9 that there\u2019s no one silver-bullet solution, just the silver buckshot of multiple solutions, although copper buckshot is probably a better metaphor, because the solutions need to get cheap to get to scale. We\u2019ll need all kinds of demand-side solutions \u2014 like meatless meats made from plants and fungi and animal cells, as well as anti-food-waste technologies ranging from\nSolar panels were invented in the 1950201060\nOf course, the development of solar has also been held back by backlash politics; Ronald Reagan removed the panels Jimmy Carter installed on the White House roof, and Trump is trying to crush clean energy while preaching energy dominance. Like I said, progress will be really hard. But it\u2019s also really important. And while perfect probably isn\u2019t on the menu, better is better than worse.\nThis may be the most important lesson of the energy transition: Climate change is not a pass-fail test. We almost surely won\u2019t meet the Paris goal of limiting warming to 15161743203042\u201c210053\nThat\u2019s not an inspiring bumper-sticker slogan, but politics is about the slow boring of hard boards. The global economy is not decarbonizing quickly enough, but it\u2019s getting a little bit less dependent on fossil fuels every day, and food can follow a similar trajectory that can help us eat less of the earth.\nIt isn\u2019t happening yet.

(\u00d8rsted)\nRevolution Wind can officially resume. But unlike the last time President Donald Trump ordered construction on an offshore wind project to pause, relief came through the courts rather than politicking.\nA federal judge on Monday ruled in favor of the Danish energy giant \u00d8rsted, whose $62halted last month by the Interior Department without, as the judge put it, any \u201cwas lifted by Trump officials in May following one month of heavy lobbying \u2014 and\nJudge Royce Lamberth, a Reagan-era appointee serving the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, granted a motion for a preliminary injunction sought by Revolution Wind to resume turbine construction while its complaint against the Interior Department works its way through the courts, which could take years. The project is 80\u201c\nMonday\u2019s decision marked a victory for Revolution Wind and could have broader legal ramifications for Trump\u2019s ongoing war against offshore wind energy, given that several projects are still tangled up in litigation. And, if the recent ruling is any indication, the Trump administration may have a hard time convincing judges that walking away from already-approved wind farms makes sense.\n\u201c\n## All eyes on the courts now\nTwelve other high-profile lawsuits are actively challenging Biden-era approvals for eight U.S. wind farms, according to the research firm ClearView Energy Partners. Traditionally, the government defends projects it\u2019s already greenlit. Legally, however, it can pick and choose which approvals to stand up for.\nFor example, three of those projects \u2014 New England Wind, SouthCoast Wind, and the Maryland Offshore Wind Project \u2014 could soon lose their federal approvals. None of the three have started construction yet, but in the past month, government officials have filed documents in court for each, trying to undo approvals granted by the Biden administration.\n\u201c\nThe latest blow came on Thursday, when government lawyers 141one filed in the U.S. District Court of Maryland the week prior seeking to take back approvals from the Maryland Offshore Wind Project.\nBoth filings invoke a new legal interpretation of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act that argues that the Interior Department must weigh other ocean activities \u2014 like commercial fishing and Coast Guard operations \u2014 in an \u201c\nThe standard interpretation, employed for almost a decade by past administrations and already upheld in a 2024, instructs agencies to take a more balanced approach to evaluating multiple ocean users.\n\u201c\u201c\nOddly, the Trump administration appears to be defending some wind projects at the center of these legal challenges while trying to tank the three others.\nFor example, on Sept. 8NJ\nThen there is the exceptional case of Virginia. Earlier this month, E&GOP90\nBeing inconsistent in when and how it deploys new legal interpretations could backfire for the Trump administration.\nOn Monday, Lamberth told government lawyers that \u201c\n## Lawmakers weigh in\nMeanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are clearly frustrated that most of the offshore wind projects in Trump\u2019s crosshairs are in solidly blue states at a moment when they have little power in Congress to fight back. Many Democrats see the courts as the best hope for surmounting the administration\u2019s continued efforts to block the development of wind power, which they view as necessary for meeting growing electricity demand.\n\u201c\nThe longtime climate hawk discussed new data showing that electricity prices in the U.S. have \u201c\nRevolution Wind\u2019s stop-work order had been bleeding its developers of \u201c2a risk to New England\u2019s future grid reliability.\n\u201c\nFor Revolution Wind, Monday\u2019s legal victory may only be temporary \u2014 federal officials could appeal the ruling. A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment. A similar but separate lawsuit challenging Revolution Wind\u2019s stop-work order, brought by the attorneys general of Rhode Island and Connecticut, is winding its way through the courts.

The Utilities Commission isn\u2019t required to take action following its Oct. 1415\nThat\u2019s part of why Tyler Norris, a former solar developer and a thought leader on load flexibility who presented last week, hopes it will become a choice for data centers if nothing else.\n\u201c\u201c\nData centers aren\u2019t the only new large customers driving ever-growing electricity demand forecasts in North Carolina, which Duke used to justify a massive new fleet of gas plants in its most recent proposed long-term plan. But the centers are the most voracious consumers by far, accounting for\nNot all of these facilities in the pipeline will come to fruition: It\u2019s not uncommon for tech companies to request grid connections in multiple locations before deciding where they\u2019ll actually build. But many will materialize, posing thorny issues for the utility and its regulators.\nWhat if Duke can\u2019t build generation quickly enough to serve the energy-hungry centers? Can the company do so while still zeroing out its carbon pollution, as required by state law? How can regulators assure that tech giants, not residential customers, pay for new power plants and associated upgrades to the grid?\nLoad flexibility could provide an elegant answer to these vexing questions.\nThe idea is rooted in a counterintuitive reality: Data centers don\u2019t run at maximum tilt 100EMS\nThat\u2019s true for a number of reasons, 247\n\u201c\nInformation on data centers\u2019 exact electricity use is scant, and it appears to vary based on type, but research suggests the facilities\u2019 peak consumption is about 80\nYet utility planners typically assume otherwise, categorizing data centers as \u201c\u201c22\nIn the simplest terms, while Duke might build 12210080\nBut if prospective data centers were transparent about their electricity-utilization plans and committed to them on paper, utilities could adjust how they anticipate new power capacity \u2014 averting the construction of massive amounts of fossil-fuel infrastructure as well as expensive grid improvements.\nIn September, analytics groups GridLab and Telos Energy published a \u201c995\nSimilarly, Norris, a Ph.D. student at Duke University \u2014 which has no connection to the utility \u2014 is the lead author of a 0541\nThe figure \u201c\u201c\nWhile enlisting data centers to curtail their own energy use is still more theory than practice, that\u2019s slowly starting to change.

(Energy Vault)\n\u201c\nFans of hydrogen hail it as a solution to just about any entrenched decarbonization challenge, from heavy transport to steelmaking to on-demand power. But how hydrogen is produced makes a huge difference in its climate impact; seemingly clean sources can actually rack up major carbon emissions for negligible benefit. For now, the clean hydrogen economy remains largely speculative, with hardly any truly clean hydrogen being produced or any real projects using it. Many planned clean hydrogen projects have vanished without a trace, following a short-lived boom fueled by Biden-era support.\nIn Calistoga, Energy Vault has tapped hydrogen to deal with a very specific set of constraints \u2014 delivering energy without local emissions, over multiple days, in a tight footprint \u2014 but the cleanliness of that hydrogen is a more complicated issue than public descriptions of the microgrid suggest.\nThe key players all have a lot riding on the project.\nEnergy Vault, which previously raised several hundred million dollars in a singular bid to multi-story robotic cranes that 828PG&\n\u201c\u201c\nThe results of that experiment will take time to analyze.

Or the quirkiness of the design and the murkiness of hydrogen\u2019s supply chain and emissions could make it a quixotic outlier of questionable climate value.\n## Compact and cleaner backup power in a fire zone\nThe Calistoga microgrid poses an answer to the question of how to provide a few days of backup power to a small town in a small space, without worrying too much about cost. The limitations drove the design, which turned out quite unlike anything built thus far.\nEnergy Vault had to figure out how to pack 293\nLithium-ion batteries have proven themselves capable of storing power, be it as a Powerwall in someone\u2019s garage or as a large-scale grid storage facility.

Almost all commercial hydrogen is currently made from methane gas, a fossil fuel, through a procedure called steam methane reforming that sends the carbon dioxide byproduct straight into the atmosphere.\nFor hydrogen to stake any claim as a climate solution, it needs to be made without massive carbon emissions. That usually involves an alternative production method called electrolysis, which separates hydrogen from water using electricity. But this method can produce even more emissions than the dirty methane version if the electrolyzers are drawing power from the grid rather than dedicated renewable sources like solar and wind (see this previous Canary Media coverage for a detailed account of why that\u2019s the case).\nEnergy Vault describes the hydrogen it\u2019s using in Calistoga as \u201c\nDuring a tour of the microgrid, Deepesh Goyal, vice president of stationary power at Plug Power, told Canary Media that Plug Power currently supplies hydrogen from its electrolyzer site in Georgia, which runs on grid power. More than half of Georgia\u2019s electricity comes from fossil fuels, so that electrolysis incurs substantial power-plant emissions. Plug Power buys credits for clean energy supply to compensate for this, Goyal said.\nTo meet the highest federal standard for clean hydrogen, producers need to obtain clean power matched to their consumption on an hourly basis in the areas where they operate. Plug Power did not respond in time for publication to questions clarifying what type of credits it buys. But a spokesperson for Energy Vault told Canary Media that currently there aren\u2019t any facilities that could supply Calistoga with liquid hydrogen from electrolysis powered by time-matched, dedicated clean electricity, and the earliest such facility is targeting completion in 2026\nGoyal also said some of Calistoga\u2019s hydrogen comes from an unnamed partner in Las Vegas that uses renewable natural gas (RNGRNGconvoluted calculations of California\u2019s clean fuels bureaucracy.

(Wendy Becktold)\nIf someone were to design a climate solution from a blank slate, they probably wouldn\u2019t run electrolyzers on grid power in Georgia in order to load the super-cooled hydrogen onto diesel-powered tankers and haul it more than 2800\n\u201c\u201c\nOne incontrovertible fact is that the microgrid doesn\u2019t combust anything onsite, so the operations within the fenceline emit almost no carbon emissions and don\u2019t impact air quality. But it will be hard to gauge the real climate impacts of such a project until a more verifiably clean and geographically localized hydrogen supply chain develops. Several companies have said they will build truly green hydrogen production in the coming years. That task has only grown more difficult with the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to thwart renewables development and vastly curtail clean hydrogen tax credits.\n## Will other buyers accept the cost of liquid hydrogen backup?\nThe other make-or-break variable for hydrogen-backed resilience is how much it costs. Liquid hydrogen is an expensive, specialty fuel only produced by a handful of suppliers in the U.S., and clean liquid hydrogen is even rarer.\nFor this first project, Energy Vault didn\u2019t need to worry about consumer price sensitivity.

Batteries are completely dependent on fossil fuels and have a supply chain dominated by a country that burns over 90 exajoules of coal per year to power their economy. Then those battery cells or battery raw materials get shipped on diesel boats to America. Once those batteries arrive on our shores, we call them green as if they were made by magic. If people want to understand the sustainability of batteries, they should be made here. According to battery proponents, even if you smelt metal with coal or use coal to power your electric arc furnace, it's better for global emissions. So make the battery raw materials here. Hydrogen is 100x cleaner than batteries and can be made in America. Batteries have a long way to go in America and can only be made with heavy dependence on fossil fuels. Let's keep the playing field level here. Where is the paragraph about how the batteries in this microgrid were made explaining the critical dependency on coal & diesel fuel?\nG\nGeorge Kafantaris\n0 points\n3 months ago\nAll batteries \u2014 no matter how good or cheap they might be \u2014 still need to be charged \u2014 by drawing power from the wires of our anemic electric grid \u2014 the same grid that now struggles to keep the lights on. To make this possible, we can redo our grid, or we can supplement it throughout with power generators. The power generators can run on diesel fuel or natural gas. Or they can run on hydrogen. If they run on diesel fuel or natural gas, the benefit of having battery cars is defeated. If the power generators run on hydrogen, they will need to be refueled \u2014 which means we must put a hydrogen infrastructure in place to do so. But if we are going to have a hydrogen infrastructure to refuel hydrogen generators to charge battery cars, why not also use the same infrastructure to refuel hydrogen cars and trucks to use the hydrogen directly?\nL\nLawrence Wood\n0 points\n3 months ago\nThis sounds great for everyone except the poor guy who has to deliver a truck full of liquid hydrogen to this town because the state has been on fire for more than 48 hours\n## read next\n* ![Gray metal boxes lined up with a blue sky overhead ](\nBatteries\n### California has a new law to prevent big grid battery fires\n* ![Aerial shot of a large warehouse complex next to homes ](\nVirtual power plants\n### Can crowdsourcing help solve the data-center power crunch?\n* ![A large ship with cargo at a port ](\nMarine transport\n### Global rules to decarbonize ships delayed amid Trump\u2019s pushback\n* ![ ](\nPolitics\n### The DOE\u2019s loan office enters its \u2018energy dominance\u2019 era\n![](",

    "content":"The state will lower electricity rates for heat pump owners this winter, and is considering even deeper cuts to encourage residents to ditch fossil-fueled heating.\n![](\nBy Sarah Shemkus\n25 July 2025\n* *\n!An HVAC equipment box on a brick wall behind plants\n(Ranko Veuger via Getty Images)\nMassachusetts regulators are considering a plan to make heat pumps an obvious financial choice for most residents.\nThe state Department of Public Utilities is mulling a proposal to heavily discount electricity rates in the winter months for households with heat pumps, a move that could cut energy bills for more than 80\nMassachusetts utilities already plan to lower prices for heat pump users starting this winter, but the proposal under consideration would mandate even deeper discounts in future years. The new rates could accelerate the adoption of heat pumps in Massachusetts and boost progress toward the state\u2019s climate goals, proponents say.\nAnd with President Donald Trump\u2019s megabill eliminating federal tax credits at the end of this year for homeowners who install heat pumps, the approach is a timely demonstration of how states can drive heat pump adoption in the absence of federal support.\n\u201c\u201c\nIn Massachusetts and other states with ambitious climate goals, transitioning residents from fossil-fueled heating to heat pumps \u2014 which can both warm and cool buildings \u2014 is a major strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the cost of buying and operating a heat pump has held back widespread adoption, particularly in areas like New England, where cold winters and high electricity prices collide.\n\u201c\nToday, nearly 80900002021202450000020202030\nThat, say climate advocates, is where seasonal heat pump rates come in.\n## Making heat pump operation affordable\nUnder current default electric rates, roughly three in four Massachusetts homes switching from natural-gas heating to heat pumps would 301000\n\u201c\nMassachusetts has already taken steps to start closing that gap with discounted electricity prices for homes using heat pumps. Regulators approved the lower rates proposed by two of the state\u2019s investor-owned electric utilities, Unitil and National Grid, in June 20242025\nThe planned discounts range from 47\nIf Eversource\u2019s rates are approved, Massachusetts will become the first state in which all investor-owned utilities offer a seasonal rate specifically for heat pumps, Sachs said. Other states have seasonal rates that also include electric resistance heating, or have individual utilities or municipal power companies that offer heat pump rates, she said.\nStill, the state Department of Energy Resources, along with lots of climate advocates, doesn\u2019t think the current plans go far enough. In January, the energy department filed a petition asking utility regulators to consider requiring even further discounts, as recommended by the state Interagency Rates Working Group, a collaborative effort of Massachusetts agencies that examines ways to modify rate design to accelerate decarbonization.\nThe discounts suggested in the filing range from 121782687301000\n\u201c\nSome 20\n## How do seasonal heat pump rates work?\nSupporters of seasonal heat pump rates stress that the lower prices do not mean that heat pump users are being subsidized by everyone else. In fact, they say, the proposed rate structure is far more fair than the status quo.\n\u201c\u201c\nHere\u2019s why: The delivery portion of an electricity bill pays for the construction and upkeep of the poles, wires, and other infrastructure needed to get power where it\u2019s going. To determine how much to charge customers \u2014 and this is a bit of a simplification \u2014 the utility divides the total cost by the number of kilowatt-hours it expects customers to use. That number becomes the delivery rate.\nHowever, the delivery infrastructure is built to accommodate the demand peaks that happen on the hottest days of summer, when millions of air conditioners turn on at once. In the winter, peak demand is only about 80\n\u201c\u201c\nThe idea is that utilities won\u2019t end up taking a financial hit, because the heat pumps use more electricity at this lower rate, keeping revenue steady. Individual consumers, however, save money by eliminating their need for pricier fossil fuels or by switching from costly electric resistance heating to efficient heat pumps.\nHowever, seasonal heat pump rates are only a short-term solution. The logic supporting them only holds as long as the system peak occurs in the summer.

I was quoted by 4 different companies. Anywhere from 15000 to 28000 now that seems to be a huge gap and Massachusetts should regulate it. If the house needs 2 heat pumps, for example, it should be X amount of dollars. If it needs three x amount of dollars, if it needs four x amount of dollars, but be consistently the same not for example, I was quoted seventeen thousand for 4 heat pumps buy one company and then another company told me twenty eight thousand now, if there is no regulation by massachusetts. This is why most people aren't getting them because they're afraid of getting scammed as am I? So if you guys want to regulate it, I bet you, you guys would get people to do it. And if you offered incentive 4 landlords to do it, I bet you, it would be done more efficiently as well. And more people would do it just my two cents.\nJ\nJuan-Pablo Velez\n0 points\n3 months ago\nYou're right that the unpredictability is big problem! If you're in Boston, there's a group called Laminar Collective that does bulk-purchasing of heat pump to solve exactly this problem.\nJ\nJerry Normandin\n0 points\n3 months ago\nHeat Pumps do not work well in temperatures below 35 degrees. I know first hand because my son and his wife took advantage of the MA Save rebate and had one installed. It only works well between 40 degrees to 90 degrees. If it's below 40 degrees they rely on the original gas fired baseboard heat and if it's too hot they need to use a large 12k BTU window AC. There are going to be many angry home owners We live in a location where it can get extremely hot and humid and extremely cold. We need energy diversification... We can not solely rely on electricity for heating and cooling.\nJ\nJuan-Pablo Velez\n0 points\n3 months ago\nSounds like your family may not have installed a cold-climate heat pump? We're in upstate New York and ours work great well below 0.\nIf this wasn't the case, then heat pumps wouldn't be the leading HVAC system being installed in Maine:\nR\nReal Name\n0 points\n3 months ago\nI'll believe it when I see it! $700 - $1000 in savings? Saving on what, electric bills? Sure, if your using electricity to heat your house. I can go all winter and then some on 2 tanks of oil. At $2.75 \/gal x (2 x 250 gal) = $1375 I spend about $900 per year on electricity which includes a week or two of window AC, dehumidifier in the basement and an electric range.\nA\nAnn Van Dyke\n0 points\n3 months ago\nThis is good news...I have had a heat pump system for a few years and welcome the effort to make if more economical. I hope it drives more widespread adoption. I would say that some attention should be paid to cushioning the blow for the companies that provide oil for heating as heat pump adoption will hurt their business.\nI\nInfo User\n0 points\n3 months ago\nTo Jerry: Today's heat pump systems operate at a much lower temperature. I have a Bosch (one of the better manufacturers), and it works down to -15 below zero. The 40 degree temp you stated is a very old # (or they got a unit from a very poor mfgr). It's hard to get a unit that poor in today's market. I was able to get off of oil (and it's unpredictable pricing from year to year), and delivery to the house nature of oil. Then I got solar, and have negative electric bills in the summer, and those credits build up to eliminate or reduce the electric bills in the winter when the sun is lower in the sky.

The utility, also known as NIPSCO\nBut the move is raising alarm bells for watchdog groups and other critics, who argue that rather than protect consumers, the plan will mainly enrich the utility\u2019s parent company while interfering with market competition and undercutting important regulatory safeguards.

Chief among them is that GenCo does not have to file a detailed plan when it wants to build or acquire new generation. The commission did not set any minimum standards or requirements regarding how power will be provided to data centers, as advocates had hoped. Instead, the commission will review each proposed contract between NIPSCONIPSCO\nThe Citizens Action Coalition called this case-by-case review process unfair and inefficient, making it too difficult for stakeholders to monitor the situation and submit public comments to the commission.\n\u201c\u201c\nNIPSCOCEO\n\u201c\nThe Citizens Action Coalition and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, a state agency tasked with protecting consumers, notified the commission that they plan to appeal the approval of GenCo.\n## Concerns about a market edge\nAnother major concern of critics is that GenCo will have an unfair competitive advantage over other power producers.\nIndiana has a regulated energy market, wherein utilities have the right to serve as monopoly producers and distributors of energy, but regulators must approve how much capacity they build or buy and what they charge customers for the power.\nGenCo is largely exempt from this structure, acting more akin to a power producer in a state like Illinois, with a deregulated market.

Davies described Wyoming regulators\u2019 creation of such a special tariff to serve a Microsoft data center.

Indeed, these guidelines can even boost the growth of affordable housing, say local advocates.\nIn 2024adopted a stringent building code that requires high energy-efficiency performance.

In 2022\u201c\nSimilar battles have played out across the country, from California to New York.\nThere is plenty of evidence that electrified, highly efficient homes don\u2019t need to come with a price premium.\nA 2022RMIadopted lower wintertime rates for homes with heat pumps. In 2023\u201c\n## A sustainable housing surge in Lexington\nAfter Lexington changed its zoning rules in 20233122100\nThe new construction will include both rental units and condos available to purchase that will, in total, increase available housing in town by 99150002025\nHowever, most of the construction driven by the new zoning is required to make 1540200\nThe municipal project will include four residential buildings designed to be energy-efficient and to minimize the square footage of halls and other common areas, which will reduce the cost of heating and cooling these spaces. Solar panels on the roofs will offset the electricity consumed by the building\u2019s heat pumps, said Dave Traggorth, principal with Causeway Development, the company chosen to develop the property.\n\u201c\u201c\nAll of these new projects \u2014 market-rate and affordable \u2014 will be prohibited from using fossil fuels to run furnaces or other appliances because of the town\u2019s requirement that new construction be fully electric.\nThe town has also adopted an optional, more rigorous version of the state building code that requires new, multifamily projects over 12000\n\u201c\nWhile Lexington is a particularly active town, the other nine communities that have banned fossil fuels in new construction have all reported that the rules have posed no obstacle to development, Cunningham said. Restrictive zoning and antidevelopment sentiment among residents are much more pressing problems, she said.\nFor the eventual residents, the benefits go beyond the knowledge that their homes are helping cut emissions. Homes designed to passive house standards use far less energy than those that are conventionally built, creating ongoing savings for homeowners and tenants, and have been found to generally have better indoor air quality. When the power goes out, these well-sealed buildings can keep interior temperatures comfortable for days.\n## Paving the way for electrification\nIt is no accident that residential developers were ready to jump when opportunities opened up in a town with stringent efficiency and electrification rules. Massachusetts has been laying the groundwork for years, said Lauren Baumann, director of sustainability and climate initiatives for the Massachusetts Housing Partnership, a nonprofit that works to expand affordable housing.\n\u201c\nIn 2019awarded $173 to eight affordable, multifamily projects to help accelerate the adoption of passive house standards in multifamily construction by demonstrating that the approach makes financial sense. That same year, the state\u2019s energy-efficiency program administrator, Mass Save, launched an initiative offering money to multifamily projects for feasibility studies, energy modeling, and analyses of post-construction energy performance.\nThese incentives gave architects and contractors a lower-risk way to become familiar with a new approach to building. And familiarity, in this case, bred knowledge, skills, and enthusiasm.\n\u201c\u201c\nTraggorth has seen this evolution in his work. Five years ago, he said, if he approached a contractor to discuss building to passive house standards, he was often greeted with confusion.

Morgan\n-1 points\n3 months ago\nHeating your home with electricity sounds great, until you recognize that most electricity production in MA is fueled by a fossil fuel: natural gas!\nS\nSophia M.\n0 points\n3 months ago\nYou're correct that the single largest source of electricity is currently generated from natural gas. However, the electricity generated from a natural gas plant is lower in net carbon emissions than the same amount of gas burned directly in the home. There are significant scale efficiencies.\nMoreover, gas burned within the home creates particulates which aren't great for respiratory health (this is why you should always use a vent over a gas stove).\nLastly, it's significantly easier to built new construction with an electric only supply and then transition the net supply of power towards lower-carbon options than to do things the other way around - building gas hookups as a short\/medium term solution and then having to demolish them is wasteful.\nG\nG. Morgan\n0 points\n3 months ago\nConcerning \"However, the electricity generated from a natural gas plant is lower in net carbon emissions than the same amount of gas burned directly in the home. There are significant scale efficiencies.\" This may be theoretically true, but many followers believe the answer is: It depends.\nFor example, net carbon emissions from gas-fired plants vary wildly as determined by the generation technology used, for example, single fired vs. combined-cycle generation and whether carbon-capture technologies are employed. You're probably aware that 5% - 10% of plant-generated electricity is lost in transmission.\nHome heating with gas can be more or less efficient depending, again, on the technologies employed. Yes, venting has to be implemented.\nI'm all in with respect to home heating with electricity, recognizing that this will probably require nuclear as the primary generation source. In the interim, clean-burning natural gas is the best solution.\n## read next\n* ![ ](\nGeothermal\n### California can\u2019t get out of its own way on geothermal\n* ![Profile shot of a woman speaking into a microphone ](\nUtilities\n### Why utility regulators need to do more than call \u2018balls and strikes\u2019\n* ![ ](\nSponsored\n### The case for optimism in America\u2019s energy transition\n* ![Aerial shot of large warehouse surrounded by other buildings ](\nBatteries\n### In a first, a data center is using a big battery to get online faster\n![](",

One of the major sources of Texas' winter grid vulnerability is Texas has too many poorly insulated homes and apartments that use resistant (electricity) heat which is very inefficient. An 800 sq. ft apartment at 15 degrees, uses the same electricity as a 2,500 sq. ft. house uses at 100 degrees. Texas should pass legislation that no future residential use electric heat.\nA\nArt Feierman\n0 points\n6 months ago\nInteresting. While one system is inherently simpler than two, I'm having a hard time buying into the savings claimed for using electric over gas. I'm a fan of heat pumps which are very efficient, but with electric in CA costing 2.5x - 3.5x what most folks in the US pay for electric, I would think those heat pumps would have to be several times more efficient than gas, not the moderately more efficient that is normally what we all read. $.40 - $.50 per Kw is just crazy. Here in FL, our electric definitely averages less than $.15\/kw.\nI'd love to know what electric rate they used to conclude about the savings. I wouldn't be surprised if they chose to use the national average, around $.14 but that's 1\/3 of what most Californian's are averaging.\nThe electric in our condo peaks out at about $250 a month with the air conditioning running in the summer where the average day time highs are in the 90s and the average lows in the 70s. The air conditioners don't get much of a break. I'd be looking at $700+ a month if I was still living with CA electric rates.\nThe bright spot in CA's efforts seems to be the dramatic expansion of Grid level battery usage, especially with the CA rooftop solar market collapsing since solar owners no longer get big payouts for electric they ship to the grid. .\nStill when it comes to grid batteries, CA is now apparently not terribly behind Texas in that regard.\nS\nSheila B\n0 points\n6 months ago\nheat pumps provide roughly 400 times the heat from a single unit of energy than gas does, so it is silly to claim that electric heating will cost more or will be less efficient - nobody is suggesting resistant heat, ever:\ninduction is also many times more efficient than gas stovetops, using magnets to heat pans, not combusted gas to heat mostly the air around the outside of the pan (while poisoning everyone living there), and it's faster, cleaner and far more accurate.\nrooftop solar + energy storage + Passiv Haus building codes + islanding microgrids + electric transportation = 21st century. anything else is wasteful, poisonous, anti-democratic and overpriced.\nD\nDarell Dickey\n0 points\n6 months ago\nLet's totally waste a crisis and rebuild with gas to perpetuate the disaster.\nThis reminds me a lot of motonormativity. We pretend that we\u2019re trying to emphasize safety over speed and convenience. But of course we don\u2019t do that. We give a safety pass to cars even though we know how much harm they cause. In the case of natural gas in new buildings, we know the dangers and the extra expense of adding this second energy source, but we give it a pass. how many times can we completely waste a crisis? There has never been an easier, cheaper more appropriate time to switch a large swath of the population away from gas.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen repeatedly that retrofitting later down the line is more expensive than constructing all-electric to begin with,\u201d gosh, ya think?\nThe idea of losing one\u2019s home to a fire is tough to fathom.

By being flexible\nData centers could help slash costs and grid-upgrade times by easing off of utility grids during peak hours and finding ways to provide their own power.\n![](\nBy Jeff St. John\n27 February 2025\n* *\n![](\n(Binh Nguyen)\nThis is the fourth and final article in our series \u200b\u201c _Boon or bane: What will data centers do to the grid?\u201d_\nTom Wilson is aware that the explosive growth of data centers could make electricity costlier and dirtier. As a principal technical executive at the Electric Power Research Institute, the premier U.S. utility research organization, he\u2019s studied the risks himself.\nBut he also thinks conversations about the problem tend to miss a key point. Data centers could also make the grid cleaner and cheaper by embracing a simple concept: flexibility.\n\u201c\u201c\nDCFlex is short for \u201c\nSince its October launch, DCFlex has grown from 1537\u201cQTSAI\nOn the grid side are utilities such as Duke Energy, Pacific Gas &NRG\nThe range of participants reflects the broad interest in solving the pressing challenge of powering the data centers being proposed around the country without driving up grid costs and emissions.\nThat won\u2019t be easy. From Virginia\u2019s \u201cutilities are being inundated with demands for round-the-clock power from data center projects that can add the equivalent of a small city\u2019s electricity consumption within a few years. Meanwhile, it usually takes four or five years to connect new power plants to the grid.\nFlexibility could make a big difference, however, said Tom Wilson, who\u2019s worked on climate and energy issues for more than four decades, including advising projects at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University and serving at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy during the Biden administration.\nThat\u2019s because the impacts of massive new utility customers like data centers are tied not just to how much power they need but specifically to when\n## Why flexibility matters\nUtilities live and die by the few hours per year when demand for electricity peaks \u2014 usually during the hottest and coldest days. By refraining from using grid power during those peak hours, new data centers could significantly reduce their impact on utility costs and carbon emissions.\nIf data centers and other big electricity customers committed to curtailing their power use during peak hours, it could unlock tens of gigawatts of \u201c&\nRealizing that spare capacity will be challenging, though. For starters, every new large power customer would have to agree not to use grid power during key hours of the year, which is far from a realistic expectation today. What\u2019s more, utilities would need some serious proof that those big customers can actually follow through with promises to not use power during those peak times before letting them connect, because broken promises in this case could lead to overloaded grids or forced blackouts.\nAnd flexibility can\u2019t solve all the power problems that massive data center expansion could cause.\nIn a driving an unprecedented fivefold increase in the amount of new power demand that U.S. utilities and grid operators forecast over the next half decade or so. While that analysis \u201c\u201c\nStill, for utilities struggling to plan and build the generation and grid infrastructure needed to support data centers, flexibility is worth exploring. That\u2019s because data centers could make their operations flexible a lot faster than utilities can expand power grids and build power plants.\nIt typically takes seven to 10\u201cjust starting to take hold in utility planning, but it could play a major role in managing the surge in power demand.\nFlexible data centers may also be able to secure space on capacity-constrained grids more quickly than inflexible competitors, Tom Wilson said. A \u201c35015\n\u201c\nThat\u2019s not lost on Brian Janous, cofounder of \u201c\n\u201c\u2018\u2018\u201c\nIn fact, 240\nJanous thinks many utilities are eager for similar propositions today. One unnamed utility executive told him recently that the backlog for connecting large data centers to its grid is now at least five years. \u201c\u2018\u2018\n## The role of on-site generation\nGetting utilities and data centers together to ask those kinds of questions is what DCFlex is all about. Project partners are now developing five to 10\u201c\nAs for how these projects will help the grid, he laid out two broad methods: They\u2019ll use on-site power generation or storage to replace what they\u2019d otherwise pull from the grid, or they\u2019ll use less electricity during peak hours.\nJanous thinks on-site generation is the simpler approach. To some extent, it\u2019s already happening today but typically with dirty diesel generators. Janous, Tom Wilson, and other experts say these diesel generators are not a viable option for hyperscalers, however. They\u2019re simply too dirty and too expensive to rely on, except during grid outages or other dire situations.\nBiodiesel and renewable diesel could work for some smaller data centers, Tom Wilson said. But it\u2019s not yet clear whether air-quality rules would permit generators burning those fuels to run during nonemergencies. Nor are the economics viable for larger-scale data centers, he said.\nFossil-gas-fired backup generators like those Microsoft used in Cheyenne are another option \u2014 albeit one that still pollutes the local air and warms the planet. Still, a growing number of data center developers are looking to use them as a workaround to grid constraints. \u201c\u201c\nIt would be a problem for the planet \u2014 and for meeting the climate goals major tech companies have committed to \u2014 if data centers planned to use fossil gas for a majority of their power. But if relied on sparingly and strategically, this choice might be less harmful than the alternatives: If a data center burns fossil gas just to power itself during grid peaks, that might reduce pressure on utilities to keep old coal-fired power plants open or to build much larger gas-fired plants that would lock in emissions for decades.\nOther gas-fueled options for on-site power might be less damaging to the climate \u2014 although this remains a hotly debated topic.

(Pivot Energy)\nTo all the challenges the solar industry is facing today, add one more: cultivating a domestic market for lamb meat. It may seem an unlikely mission for clean-energy developers, but in many states, including Illinois, grazing sheep between rows of photovoltaic panels is considered the most efficient form of agrivoltaics \u2014 the combination of solar and farming on the same land.\nSolar advocates, researchers, and developers have given much attention to agrivoltaics. The practice includes growing crops like blueberries, tomatoes, or peppers in the shade of solar panels and letting cows or sheep graze around the arrays.\nPerhaps the biggest benefit of agrivoltaics is that land is not being taken out of agricultural production in favor of clean energy, a concern that has stoked intense opposition to solar. The Trump administration codified this sentiment when the head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 19\u201c\nIllinois\u2019 sprawling fields of corn and soybeans don\u2019t coexist well with solar panels, but sheep do, making grazing a promising type of agrivoltaics for the state, proponents say.\nIn a typical solar grazing arrangement, sheep farmers (called grazers) are paid by solar developers to bring the animals to sites hosting large arrays \u2014 often farms \u2014 where they munch away on the vegetation. Meanwhile, the landowner benefits from lease payments. Grazing is a lower-emissions alternative to mechanical mowing, and sheep can reach corners that mowers can\u2019t.\nBut to make a living herding sheep, the grazers need to be able to sell the lambs they raise as meat. In the U.S., lamb is sold primarily in halal markets and appears on menus only during Easter holidays.\n\u201c\u201c\n## A taste for lamb\nBrooke Watson would like to see demand for lamb soar in the Midwest, in tandem with demand for solar grazing.

That means grazing sheep under solar panels is continuing these areas\u2019 traditional agriculture.\nBut in Illinois, there is little history of raising sheep. So converting acres of the state\u2019s primary corn and soybean fields may still raise eyebrows.\n\u201c\u201c\nSolar grazing goats, meanwhile, has been \u201c\nSolar panels suited for sheep are \u201c\u201c\nSheep may be the state\u2019s best option for large arrays because, Anderson thinks, there\u2019s limited potential for solar panels to occupy the same land as the state\u2019s traditional sprawling corn and soybean fields.\n\u201c\u201c\nWhile solar grazing in Illinois might often replace corn or soybean production, Watson sees it as a positive trade-off.\n\u201c\u201c\nThe Watsons work with a solar developer called Pivot Energy.

But Brooke Watson noted that, unlike solar grazers in Western states, she and her husband don\u2019t need to provide much water for sheep in summer, as the lush vegetation and frequent rain suffice. In any state, solar grazing means ensuring that there are safe fences or wires around sites and that predators are kept out.\n\u201c\u201c\nThe organization United Agrivoltaics connects would-be grazers with solar developers and provides resources for insurance and contracts, Winter added.\nAmerican Farmland Trust\u2019s Midwest solar specialist Alan Bailey noted that existing crop residue or debris must be cleared and specific cover crops planted to prepare for solar grazing, but this can happen while an array is being built. \u201c\nBecause solar grazing\u2019s benefits to the land and environment are well established, Winter said, boosting the lamb market is \u201c\n\u201c\u201c\n* Solar\n* Food and farms\n* Midwest\n* Illinois\nKari Lydersen is a contributing reporter at Canary Media who covers Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\nUpvotesNewestOldest\nB\nBrook Porter\n0 points\n47 days ago\nGreat article Kari!

Now, as utilities scramble to meet even more power demand for AIHVAC\nThe concept is simple enough: Put a battery on central ACs that can charge up when energy is plentiful and take over the job of running the appliances when the grid is stressed. But actually doing that requires grappling with the forces that shape America\u2019s energy system \u2014 monopoly utilities, regulators, decentralized energy, intermittent renewable power, and the looming colossus of data centers\u2019 energy consumption.\n\u201cRE. \u201c300HVAC\nNow Carrier has begun installing its HVAC-connected batteries in a pilot test with utilities to prove that the product works in customers\u2019 homes.

Then Carrier would operate the batteries based on signals from each utility, charging the devices at times of cheap, clean energy \u2014 like during midday in regions with lots of solar generation \u2014 and powering the cooling system directly from the battery when electricity demand surges.\n\u201cHVACHVACHVAC15\u201c\nCarrier\u2019s market domination \u2014 the company has been making air conditioners since its founder, Willis Carrier, invented the thing in 1902\nCarrier, in short, is the rare century-old incumbent trying to shake up its own business to respond to the dynamic shifts in the contemporary energy market.\n## The incredible leverage of home air conditioning\n\u201cHVACRMI\u201c\nThe power mix gets dirtier in the peak hours \u2014 California regularly runs on huge amounts of solar power at noon on sunny days but fires up its gas-burning peaker plants to meet demand in the evenings.

Sending AC power to a home to be converted to DC power (to be stored in an HVAC system's onboard battery) to then be converted back to AC = \"conversion loss.\" Whatever that is, multiply it by -- ultimately -- millions of consumers.\nAnd for what? A battery that's only powerful enough to power one appliance? And for temporary (peak demand reduction management) time spans at that? That's a LOT of hardware\/labor and downwind repairs\/maintenance for, I fear, boondoggle-scale overall gain on a new, untested (hence, long-debugging period\/expense) product. If \u201cinnovators\u201d want to spend public (taxpayer, ratepayer) money, they should stop and cost-compare, for example, Big Picture scenarios like incentivizing Virtual Power Plants (VPP). Thus, on-grid\/off-grid homeowners like me: At age 70, I just DIY-installed another 3.6KW of solar panels on my roof and have paired refrigerator and similar class loads with 2KWH-class solar generators like the Bluetti Elite 200 V2. That automatically puts money in my pocket (reduced power bills) WHILE reducing demand on the grid.\nThere are plenty of folks like me (and will be, soon, if my idea is adopted). Hence, consider (as a better plan) offering me\/us a decent price to add even more solar (my metal roof can take on another 10KW) and an even larger battery that can be tapped by Big Power during peak periods. I wouldn't even expect any money up front (read: no subsidies!). Just guarantee me a decent rate (matching what power companies now pay for peaker plant power) when my home battery is tapped. This \"free market\" incentivizing would animate the very core of a VPP system: private investment with a power company purchase rate = win-win rate for owners\/ratepayers. Rather than twaddle with millions of high-breakage\/maintenance \u201cmini-batteries\u201d saddled with permanent AC-DC-AC conversion losses, VPPs should be explored to confirm what my gut says: That they will generate far more productive energy returns AND prosperity (I\u2019m betting that many other, existing solar-generation owners like me would expand, thus creating more jobs and economic multiplier effects).\nVPPs are already being tried in Vermont and elsewhere; I\u2019d like to see that option explored here first. Because what's being pitched here sure seems Dead On Arrival. I\u2019ll be opening up a \u201cLow-Cost Solar\u201d YouTube channel on this soon. \u201cWatch this space.\u201d James C. Desmond Gillis Springs, GA\nA\nArt Feierman\n0 points\n29 days ago\nVery interesting idea. A great follow up might look at the costs involved to see how financially practical it is. With over 4 million heat pumps sold in the US last year, and likely another 4 million air conditioners, that's 8 million batteries (if all heat pump\/AC makers paired batteries with all sales. Based on the battery sizes mentioned - 5 to 10 KWH batteries, for reference.\nFor comparison a Telsa Powerwall 2 provides about 13 KWH and installed tends to run about $13K including installation, once federal rebates are gone.\nLet's say that because of high volume, and the utilities doing it, a battery and installation being installed with a new heat pump or AC, costs are wholesale, and add $5K per battery\/install cost.\nThat's a $40 billion a year expense for the Utilities. Using data from ChatGPT (hopefully accurate), Billable residential electric use is just under $200 Billion a year.\nSo the math indicates - if the numbers I'm using are anywhere near right - for the utilities to pay for the cost, their expenses are going to rise by something like $40 Billion a year, or 20%.\nWho will pay for that - government subsidies to the utilities? New taxes on all consumers, or just increases in utility bills. Someone does have to pick up the tab.\nNow if in the next few years this can become a $2,000 or even a $1000 cost item for battery and installation, the numbers start sounding more practical.\nI would hope any such system, would be tied into a home, so that when a power outage occurred the same battery (if less efficiently) can be used to power refrigerators, lights, etc.\nLooking forward to more info on Carrier's idea.\nS\nSam Russo\n0 points\n29 days ago\nWhat a great concept! I'll bet they could get some states on board to further incentivize customers to be early adapters. Hopefully they can scale this up quickly.\n## read next\n* ![ ](\nGeothermal\n### California can\u2019t get out of its own way on geothermal\n* ![Profile shot of a woman speaking into a microphone ](\nUtilities\n### Why utility regulators need to do more than call \u2018balls and strikes\u2019\n* ![ ](\nSponsored\n### The case for optimism in America\u2019s energy transition\n* ![Aerial shot of large warehouse surrounded by other buildings ](\nBatteries\n### In a first, a data center is using a big battery to get online faster\n![](",

Over the past 1510200926\nNow, however, the dynamics of energy markets are creating new obstacles. Nationwide, electricity costs have gone up at twice the rate of inflation over the past year, and gas prices have increased by more than four times the inflation rate. Rhode Island, like other New England states, has the added difficulty of already having some of the highest electricity rates in the country. Add in cold Northeastern winters, and the state is girding for an expensive season ahead.\nAs in neighboring states, regulators, elected officials, and utilities in Rhode Island are scrambling for ways to provide some relief for residents and businesses. These efforts have increasingly looked to the bill fees that fund renewable energy incentives and energy-efficiency programs as possible targets for quick, if small, bill reductions. In Maine, for example, leaders from both sides of the aisle have sought to lower incentives for customers and community solar developments that send power back to the grid, and in Massachusetts, utility regulators ordered energy-efficiency administrators to 5\nNow, Rhode Island Energy is proposing rollbacks of its own, saying that its latest plan prioritizes customer affordability. The company has the support of the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, which points to the growth in accounts with overdue utility bills to bolster its argument that the changes will provide needed relief to consumers.\n\u201c\nAdvocates, however, say the approach is short-sighted.\n\u201c\u201c\nRhode Island\u2019s energy-efficiency offerings include home energy assessments, weatherization services, rebates on energy-saving appliances and heating and cooling systems, and contractor training. Residents and businesses that take advantage of these programs generally save money by reducing their energy use.\nThe programs also create savings for the average consumer, whether or not they participate. Because the improvements slow energy consumption, they allow utilities to build less pricey infrastructure, the cost of which is passed on to customers. Efficiency measures can also lower peak demand, reducing the need to buy costlier, dirtier power from peaker plants. In Rhode Island, efficiency programs lowered electricity use 52005202415\nAdvocates, therefore, argue that Rhode Island Energy\u2019s plan to shrink energy-efficiency spending won\u2019t actually result in more affordable power in the long run.\n\u201c\nAcadia Center\u2019s analysis also finds that more than 800\nThe draft plan has been through multiple iterations; the most recent version was released on Sept. 525\nAdvocates say they intend to keep pushing for high funding levels until the process concludes.\n\u201c\u201c\n* Energy efficiency\n* Utilities\n* Northeast\n* Rhode Island\nSarah Shemkus is a reporter at Canary Media who is based in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and covers New England.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\nUpvotesNewestOldest\n![](\nGreg Ballantyne\n0 points\n33 days ago\nThis IS a retreat.

Those conductors use carbon composites or other materials to carry more electricity with less loss of that energy, compared to traditional wires of similar diameter.\nA high-tech approach can create space on the grid for more renewable energy to come online. That would lessen the need to run expensive, polluting coal-fired power plants, said Rob Kelter, a senior attorney with the Environmental Law &\nBesides helping to mitigate climate change, less pollution would help people\u2019s health as well, Tavenor said.\nUnder HB15\nThe reports will be available to the public, and interested parties may ask the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to hold a hearing on whether utilities properly reported transmission information and whether they should be able to recover costs from customers.\nThe Ohio Power Siting Board must also require companies to consider technology solutions before it approves any new transmission projects. Companies would have to file reports and expert testimony to support any decision to forego advanced technologies in favor of conventional projects, Kelter said.\nAdvocacy groups and other stakeholders \u201c\nThe law requires the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to study the costs and benefits of the various technologies, including how to streamline their deployment.

One company thinks it can crowdsource the solution.\nCalifornia-based \u201c\nLast month, the firm unveiled its \u201c\nThe proposal comes as the nationwide boom in data center construction pushes electricity demand \u2014 find ways to enable rapid construction that don\u2019t break the grid, or customers\u2019 wallets.\nThat\u2019s where the bring-your-own-capacity concept could fill the gaps, said Dana Guernsey, Voltus\u2019 CEO\nThe approach benefits utilities and their customers because it\u2019s a lot cheaper to reduce energy use than it is to build new power plants and infrastructure. And it benefits data centers by offering a much faster route to getting a grid interconnection, as developers wouldn\u2019t have to wait years for utilities to bring new power generation online.\n\u201c\u201c\nVoltus is in a good position to spearhead this work, she said. As a virtual power plant operator, it already aggregates backup batteries, electric vehicles, smart appliances, and other fast-responding technologies to provide on-demand relief to the grid. Voltus was recently dubbed 75\u201cdemand response\u201d capacity under management.\nIn general, virtual power plants, or VPPs, could meet 102010\n## What data center developers are looking for\nVoltus already has one developer on board to participate in its bring-your-own-capacity plan:\n\u201c\nData centers, which are facing yearslong wait times to connect to the grid, are considering every available option.

Data center developers will face cost and air-quality challenges in using their ubiquitous diesel-fueled backup generators for on-site power. And they may be loath to invest in more expensive options like on-site solar, batteries, and gas-fired generators and microturbines \u2014 the \u201c\n\u201c\u201c\nDemand-response programs and VPPs can also counteract utility customers\u2019 rising power bills, since these initiatives financially compensate the individuals who allow their energy use to be managed.\n\u201c\u201c\n## Are data center developers willing to pay?\nIt won\u2019t be easy to turn these ideas into reality.\nUtilities and regional grid operators consider demand response and VPPs primarily as a tool for managing existing grid stresses, but are far less eager to allow VPPs to substitute for building more traditional power plants and upgrading the grid. It\u2019s always a tall order to get utilities to do something for the first time, but especially so when dealing with data centers, which can require a small city\u2019s worth of electricity for their operations.\nGuernsey conceded these challenges to Voltus\u2019 plan. \u201c20272028\u201c\u2018\nOne of Voltus\u2019 key early targets is PJM13Electricity bills are spiking for the region\u2019s more than 65data center hotspots like Georgia and\nJohannes Pfeifenberger, a grid-planning expert and principal with The Brattle Group, has argued for years that grid operators need to embrace VPPs and other innovations to \u201cVPPEV\nBut putting this solution into practice will require grid operators to restructure the rules by which VPPs can directly reduce a data center\u2019s impact on the system, he said. 14\nData centers may also be limited by the capacity of the power lines and substations at the points they\u2019re seeking to connect to the grid, he said. VPPs that consist of customers scattered across a grid operator\u2019s territory can\u2019t relieve those specific stresses, although other options could, such as data centers colocating at spots with ample grid capacity and building their own generation to fill those gaps, he said.\nGuernsey agreed that Voltus\u2019 bring-your-own-capacity construct \u201c\nJanous thinks data center developers are willing to pay even more than the currently inflated prices for energy if it means they can move faster.

    "content":"Thermal energy networks are catching on in the state and around the country as a way to transition off gas and lower energy costs.\n![](\nBy Sarah Shemkus\n13 February 2025\n* *\n![](\nA construction team drills a borehole for Eversource's networked geothermal project in Framingham, Massachusetts. (Eversource)\nThe recent cancellation of a Massachusetts networked geothermal project isn\u2019t dampening enthusiasm for the emerging clean-heat strategy.\nNational Grid said this month it has abandoned a planned geothermal system in Lowell, Massachusetts, due to higher-than-expected costs. The news disappointed advocates who see networked geothermal as an important tool for transitioning from natural gas heat, but they pointed to many more reasons for optimism about the concept\u2019s momentum.\nThe nation\u2019s first utility-operated neighborhood geothermal network, a loop serving 3652\n\u201c\u201c\n## How it all started\nThe idea for utility-operated networked geothermal systems, often also referred to as thermal energy networks, originated in Massachusetts. The concept grew out of conversations about the environmental and public health dangers posed by aging and increasingly leaky natural gas pipes.\nIn 201442air-source heat pumps were catching on, a growing trend that would leave fewer and fewer gas consumers to foot the bill for pipeline repairs.\nIn 2017HEET\nThermal energy networks scale up the process, connecting many buildings to one geothermal loop, allowing heating and cooling to be delivered to homes in much the same way gas and electricity are. At the same time, they offer a new business model for gas utilities grappling with states\u2019 efforts to transition away from fossil fuels. Utilities liked the idea and jumped on board.\nIn 2023\n## Geothermal networks are still heating up\nThe University of Massachusetts Lowell, which was a partner in National Grid\u2019s now-canceled project, hopes to use the engineering and design work developed for the project as the basis for a future network, said Ruairi O\u2019Mahony, senior executive director of the university\u2019s Rist Institute for Sustainability and Energy.\nEven the cancellation provides valuable insight by providing a case study of what didn\u2019t work, said Audrey Schulman, executive director of HEETlabs, a climate solutions incubator that spun off from HEET\u201c\u201c\nMeanwhile, the Framingham network began hooking up its first customers in August 2024956\nPlans are already underway to expand the system. The U.S. Department of Energy in December awarded Eversource, the city of Framingham, and HEET782026\n\u201c20\nThe widespread interest in networked geothermal systems within Massachusetts and throughout the U.S. is also promising, Camargo said. In Massachusetts, National Grid is continuing work on a different geothermal network pilot serving seven multifamily public housing buildings in the Boston neighborhood of Dorchester. Last year, HEET45000013\nNew York has also embraced the idea with enthusiasm. In 202211\n\u201c\u201c\nAcross the country, between 2227\nA report prepared by Synapse Energy Economics for HEETlabs and released last month concludes that geothermal networks offer significant financial benefits when compared with using air-source heat pumps. The analysis found that each system roughly the size of the Framingham network could generate from $1535150052\nThese savings could be used to subsidize building retrofits, making the homes and offices connected to a geothermal network highly energy efficient to optimize the impact of the ground-source heat pumps, Schulman said.\n## Challenges remain\nEven with gathering momentum, challenges remain to the widespread adoption of geothermal networks.\nRetrofitting buildings on the network is perhaps the thorniest, particularly in the Northeast where much of the building stock is older and draftier, said both utilities and advocates. In Framingham, an individual efficiency plan had to be created for each home and structure on the loop, a time- and money-consuming process. Going forward, a more streamlined, standardized procedure will likely be necessary, Camargo and Bosworth both said.\n\u201c\nCost is another concern, as the terminated Lowell project demonstrates. However, costs are likely to come down as engineers and installers gain experience in the process and develop smoother supply chains, Schulman said. The second loop planned for Framingham is already likely to be half the amount of the initial system, she said.\nAs these challenges are worked through, it is vital for Massachusetts to approach its role as a leader in geothermal networks with care, Schulman said.\n\u201c\n* Geothermal\n* Carbon-free buildings\n* Electrification\n* Utilities\n* Northeast\n* Massachusetts\nSarah Shemkus is a reporter at Canary Media who is based in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and covers New England.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\n## read next\n* ![ ](\nGeothermal\n### California can\u2019t get out of its own way on geothermal\n* ![Profile shot of a woman speaking into a microphone ](\nUtilities\n### Why utility regulators need to do more than call \u2018balls and strikes\u2019\n* ![ ](\nSponsored\n### The case for optimism in America\u2019s energy transition\n* ![Aerial shot of large warehouse surrounded by other buildings ](\nBatteries\n### In a first, a data center is using a big battery to get online faster\n![](",

(Illustration: New York Focus)\nThis .\nNew York state is one step closer to banning fossil fuels in new buildings.\nOn Friday, the State Fire Prevention and Building Code Council voted to recommend major updates to the state\u2019s building code, which is updated every five years and sets minimum standards for construction statewide. The draft updates include rules requiring most new buildings to be all-electric starting in 2026\nThe vote came after the code council went missing in action for more than two months, leaving some advocates nervous that the state might be\nThe new draft code also tightens a slew of other standards in a bid to make buildings more energy efficient and save residents money over the long term.

    "content":"The City Council is about to approve new utility franchise agreements that include more specific targets for climate progress.\n![](\nBy Frank Jossi\n12 February 2025\n* *\n!A group of people ride bicycles down a dirt path. Behind them is a city skyline and power lines.\n(LMaru\/Getty Images)\nThe city of Minneapolis is retooling a decade-old partnership with its gas and electric utilities in response to criticism that it hasn\u2019t done enough to help the city reach its climate goals.\nThe Clean Energy Partnership was established in 2014 as part of the city\u2019s last round of utility franchise agreements with Xcel Energy and CenterPoint Energy. The agreements authorize utilities\u2019 use of public right-of-way, often in exchange for fees or meeting other terms or conditions from the city.\nA little over a decade ago, Minneapolis was among the first U.S. cities to view utility franchise agreements as a potential tool to leverage for climate action. Some advocates at the time had been pressuring the city to study creating a municipal utility to accelerate clean energy, and the partnership emerged as a compromise to give the city more say in the utilities\u2019 operations.\nFormer City Council member Cam Gordon, who represented southeast Minneapolis in 2014\u201c\u201cPR\nThe City Council is set to approve new franchise agreements this week, and they include an updated memorandum of understanding for the Clean Energy Partnership that will require regular reporting on key performance indicators, new utility-specific emission goals, energy conservation, and service reliability in disadvantaged neighborhoods.\nSpokespeople for both companies said they welcome the planned changes and that the agreement reflects their interest in working with city leaders on shared clean energy goals.\nSince the partnership went into effect in 2015\nMinneapolis City Council Vice President Aisha Chughtai, who represents the council on the partnership board, expressed frustration about the lack of follow-through from utilities. \u201c\nBy the partnership\u2019s own measures, it has failed to make significant progress on five out of the city\u2019s seven major climate goals. The city is on track with its target to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from municipal operations but behind pace with its goals related to citywide, residential, commercial, or industrial emissions.\nGoing forward, the partnership board will continue to meet quarterly, but instead of revolving around city climate goals, each utility will be expected to hit specific targets within Minneapolis\u2019s borders. CenterPoint will commit to reducing emissions from natural gas use by at least 2020352021\n\u201c\u201c\nCenterPoint agreed to send a more senior executive to attend the quarterly partnership meetings, though Xcel did not. The utilities also rejected the city\u2019s proposal to hire an outside administrator to manage the partnership.\nCity leaders believe the new agreement does a better job of setting expectations, but Minneapolis will still lack formal leverage over the utilities if they fail to make progress. The agreement does not contain any penalties for failure to follow through, and the next window to renegotiate isn\u2019t until 2035\nLuke Hollenkamp, the city\u2019s sustainability program coordinator, said data reported through the partnership allows the city to make course corrections in its climate work.\n\u201c\nXcel Energy\u2019s spokesperson said the partnership has led to successes, noting that citywide emissions from electricity have declined and that Minneapolis met its goal of powering city operations with 1002023\nCenterPoint said it has invested nearly $61201725245000\nDespite the partnership\u2019s imperfections, current and former city officials said it\u2019s better to keep it in place as part of the new franchise agreements than to let it dissolve.\n\u201c\u201c\nThe City Council\u2019s climate and infrastructure committee approved the new agreements on Feb. 613\n* Clean energy\n* Emissions reduction\n* Policy & regulation\n* Utilities\n* Midwest\n* Minnesota\nFrank Jossi is an independent journalist and consultant based in St. Paul, Minnesota.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\n## read next\n* ![A Pila Mesh Home Battery atop a refrigerator in a home of one of Pila Energy\u2019s friends-and-family testers ](\nBatteries\n### The startup trying to make \u2018DIY\u2019 home batteries happen\n* ![Gray metal boxes lined up with a blue sky overhead ](\nBatteries\n### California has a new law to prevent big grid battery fires\n* ![Aerial shot of a large warehouse complex next to homes ](\nVirtual power plants\n### Can crowdsourcing help solve the data-center power crunch?\n* ![A large ship with cargo at a port ](\nMarine transport\n### Global rules to decarbonize ships delayed amid Trump\u2019s pushback\n![](",

    "content":"Adding EVs and heat pumps can be costly for households and utilities. This Bay Area startup says a smaller version of its smart electrical panel could help.\n![](\nBy Jeff St. John\n25 March 2025\n* *\n!Artist's rendering of Span Edge smart electrical panel that plugs into a utility electric meter to control EVs and heat pumps\nAn artist\u2019s rendering of the Span Edge, a new product from startup Span that integrates smart electrical panel controls into a utility electrical meter-connectible system. (Span)\nFive years ago, San Francisco\u2013based startup Span debuted a EVHVAC\nBut as more households purchase EVs, heat pumps, induction stoves, and other power-hungry devices, the demand for cheaper ways to control their electricity use is growing \u2014 not just from homeowners trying to avoid expensive electrical upgrades but utilities struggling to keep up with rising power demand, too.\nEnter the Span Edge, unveiled at the Distributech utility trade show in Dallas this week. The device packs the startup\u2019s core technology into a package that can be installed in about 15\nSpan\u2019s other products are targeted at homeowners; electrical contractors; and solar, battery, and EV\u201cCEO\nThat makes it one of a growing number of tools for utilities to manage the solar, batteries, EVs, controllable appliances, and other distributed energy resources that they must increasingly plan around.\nIf utilities manage these resources reactively, they could drive up the cost and complexity of managing the grid. But if utilities can get better information about when and how these devices use power \u2014 and if some customers are willing to adjust them sometimes to reduce grid stress \u2014 they could actually save ratepayers a lot of money.\nThat\u2019s what Span\u2019s new technology aims to allow. The company\u2019s \u201ctotal draw on the utility grid stays below a home\u2019s top electrical service capacity, which typically ranges between 100200\nHouseholds that want to exceed the limit of their electrical panel are often forced to upgrade to a larger one. Depending on where you live, that can cost from $300010000 and add days to weeks of extra time to a project, like installing an EVEV\nIt\u2019s also expensive for utilities. \u201cEV\u2018\nInstalling a device like the Span Edge could well be a more cost-effective alternative, not just for the customers who get one but for customers as a whole. Utility rates are largely determined by dividing the amount of money earned from electricity sales by the amount of money utilities have to collect from customers to cover their costs. A big and rising portion of U.S. utility costs is tied up in upgrading and maintaining their power grids, including to meet rising demand for power from EVs and heat pumps. As a result, ratepayers in many parts of the country are seeing higher bills.\nIf devices like the Span Edge can cut those grid costs while allowing people to buy more electricity for EVs and heating, rates for everyone will drop over time, Rao said. While some utilities may balk at replacing profitable grid-upgrade investments with new technology, others that want customers to electrify to meet carbon-reduction mandates or to increase electricity sales may be eager to implement it, he argued.\n!A diagram of the Span Edge device which monitors and control household \ufeffelectrical loads and connects to a utility meter The Span Edge home electrical control device can monitor and control multiple household electrical loads such as EV chargers, HVAC systems, heat pumps, electric ovens, and backup batteries, and plugs directly into a utility's electrical meter. (Span)\n## A universe of home energy controls\nSpan\u2019s smart electrical panel was among the first attempts to give the old-fashioned electrical panel a 21st\nBut similar products that also embed circuit-level controls are now available from major manufacturers, including Lunar Energy, and\nUtilities have been experimenting with such technologies for a while. Some plug directly into utilities\u2019 existing electric meters, including the Span Edge, ConnectDER\u2019s\nOthers are embedded elsewhere in a home\u2019s electrical system, like the controls product startup \u201cEV\u201c\nThe trick for all of these technologies is to combine the convenience and simplicity consumers demand with utility safety and reliability requirements, said Scott Hinson, chief technology officer of Austin, Texas\u2013based nonprofit research organization Pecan Street.\nIn a 202148200EV\nBut not all of the technologies that allow customers and utilities to sidestep upgrades necessarily meet the needs of both parties, he said.\nTake the smart-home platforms on offer from Amazon, Apple, Google, Samsung, and other tech vendors, which can control light bulbs, thermostats, ovens, refrigerators, and\nOn the other hand, rudimentary on-off control switches are far from ideal, Hinson said.\n\u201c\u201cEV\nMore importantly, Hinson said, a good system needs to control \u201cEV\u201c\nSpan\u2019s devices have two ways to do this, Rao said. Because they contain the connection points for power to flow through circuit breakers to a home\u2019s electrical wiring, the devices can directly measure how much power household loads are using \u2014 and cut them off completely in an emergency.\nAt the same time, Span uses WiFi or other technologies to communicate with \u201cEVfor EVs, how quickly they need to be recharged to give the driver the juice they need to get to where they\u2019re going next.\nWhat\u2019s important is that a system can provide both options, Rao contended. \u201c\u201c\n## What\u2019s in it for utilities \u2014 and their customers?\nHaving both visibility into and control over home electricity flows creates the groundwork for a more flexible approach to enlisting homes in utility virtual power plants, or VPPs. In simple terms, VPPs are aggregations of homes and businesses that agree to turn down power use or inject power onto the grid as utilities need, helping reduce reliance on large centralized power plants.\nMost of the virtual power plants that exist today are organized around individual devices \u2014 smart thermostats that can reduce electricity demand from air conditioning, for example, or solar-battery systems that can send power back to the grid. Each of these technologies has its limitations, and utilities\u2019 reliance on them is often constrained by a lack of precise data on how much power the grid is using or can offer at any particular time.\nA system that tracks the energy use of multiple appliances and devices in a home could bring far more precision to these VPPs, Rao said. \u201c\u2018\nUtilities certainly have a growing interest in using these kinds of devices. On Monday, Pacific Gas &\u201c\nPG&1500400done VPP, and Span, which will use its technology to allow homes to respond to utility signals.\nSpan has already tested this capability in a pilot project enlisting customers who\u2019ve installed the company\u2019s smart panels in Northern California, Rao said. The results so far are promising, although only a handful of households are taking part.\nGetting utilities to deploy Span Edge devices could expand the scale of those kinds of programs, he said. Of course, households will have to agree that letting some of their electricity use get turned off or dialed down during hours of peak grid stress is worth avoiding the cost and wait times of upgrading their electrical service to get the EV\nSpan hasn\u2019t revealed the cost of the Span Edge, which Rao said will soon be deployed in pilot projects with as-yet unnamed utilities. The company has a partnership with major smart-meter vendor Landis+Gyr, which is offering the Span Edge to its utility customers.\nThe question for utilities, regulators, and other stakeholders is whether the long-term payoff in avoided infrastructure upgrades is worth the cost of the technologies that must be deployed to make that possible. Those calculations will inform decisions such as whether customers getting the technologies should pay a portion of the price tag and how much profit utilities should be allowed to earn on the costs they bear in installing the tech.\nPG&\u201caEVEVPG&\nThe company also faces customer and political backlash to its recent rate hikes, a problem driven by its need to carry out more and costlier power grid upgrades.

Smelters in Quebec draw from the region\u2019s abundant hydropower resources, which are operated by the government-owned entity Hydro-Quebec. The price of electricity that producers pay is often tied to the price of aluminum on commodities markets, so that smelters pay less during lean times and more when the market recovers.\n\u201c\nManufacturers and utilities can also structure power-supply agreements that enable smelters to benefit, rather than strain, the grid, said Anna Johnson, a senior researcher in the industry program at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.\n\u201c\nIn New Zealand, for example, Rio Tinto\u2019s Tiwai Point smelter receives financial incentives to curb its electricity use \u2014 and therefore lower its aluminum production \u2014 during dry seasons, when hydropower resources can become critically low. In Australia, the aluminum giant Alcoa is participating in a program that turns one of its smelters into an emergency resource when the grid is overly stressed. The Australian government pays Alcoa to halt production on some of its aluminum-making potlines for about an hour at a time.\nIn the U.S., other types of industrial plants \u2014 including a titanium-melting plant in West Virginia \u2014 are using behind-the-meter solar power and battery storage systems, so that the facilities are primarily drawing from the electrical grid only during off-peak hours.\nStrategies like these that reduce electricity rates are especially crucial now that the development of cheap, renewable energy is set to slow in the United States. But manufacturers will still need access to new carbon-free electricity sources in order to produce the cleaner aluminum that customers are increasingly demanding, Sartor said.\n\u201c50100\u201c\n* Clean aluminum\n* Clean energy\nMaria Gallucci is a senior reporter at Canary Media.

In the state Department of Public Utilities\u2019 order launching the investigation into heat pump rates, regulators required Eversource to submit its own such plan by May 15\nThese lower rates are possible because utilities are essentially overcharging heat pump customers for their winter electricity use under the current system, said Mark Kresowik, senior policy director for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.\nOn each utility bill, customers pay, of course, for the electricity they use. They also pay a delivery charge that funds the construction and maintainence of a grid that can accommodate moments of peak demand: those few hot summer evenings when dishwashers, televisions, and millions of air conditioners are running at the same time.\nIn the winter, though, average demand is much lower, so the strain on the grid is much lighter. During these months, the delivery charge doesn\u2019t properly reflect the actual costs of keeping the grid running, said Kyle Murray, Massachusetts program director for clean energy nonprofit Acadia Center.\nHouseholds that operate heat pumps in the winter are \u201c\u201c\n## Public input will help refine Massachusetts heat pump discounts\nA collaboration of state agencies, known as the Interagency Rates Working Group, 51878500\nThough more numbers need to be crunched, energy advocates are inclined to support a deeper discount. Because of the high cost of electricity in Massachusetts, a larger rate reduction might be needed to make a heat pump a competitive choice, they said.\n\u201c\nAs part of the investigation into seasonal heat-pump rate design, regulators have asked the public to submit comments by June 2\nIn most cases before utility regulators, outside organizations can only participate if they become formal intervenors and have a lawyer representing them. It is expensive, time-consuming, and beyond the reach of many advocacy groups and most individuals, Chretien said. The request for comments from any interested parties opens up the proceedings, he said, allowing anyone with a stake in climate or energy affordability issues to participate.\n\u201c\u201c\nFor this approach to make a real impact, however, regulators must have a plan for reaching out to all communities, not just the narrow slice of people who are aware of public utilities regulations and issues, said Charles Hua, founder of consumer education nonprofit PowerLines. It will be important to connect with groups of different income and education levels, to ensure everyone has a voice.\n\u201c\u201c\nLove Canary Media and find our reporting valuable?

That includes the factories for EVs, lithium-ion batteries, solar panels, and other nascent cleantech sectors whose growth was just beginning to revitalize the long-stagnant U.S. manufacturing economy. Again, things aren\u2019t looking good.\nThe broad economic havoc caused by last week\u2019s announcements will itself have wide-reaching consequences. U.S. stock markets saw their\nThe dramatic tariffs come as the Trump administration promises to\nBut analysts say the tariffs, if they stick, will threaten all of these goals. They could hobble the clean-energy manufacturing buildout, which was set into motion by Biden-era industrial policy and is poised to deliver tens of thousands of factory jobs, mostly to Republican-led congressional districts. They could also make it far more expensive to build any sort of energy infrastructure in the U.S. \u2014 clean or dirty.\n\u201c \u200b\u201cAI\nAmong the suite of imposed new regulations is a 1034EV2024253220\nOther tariffs target the automotive industry and foreign-produced steel and aluminum.

But it\u2019s also the case for renewable and low-carbon energy projects such as solar and wind farms, utility-scale battery projects, green hydrogen plants, biogas plants, and the panoply of materials and equipment needed to expand and modernize the U.S. electric grid.\nAll of these sectors rely on imports of raw materials such as steel and aluminum, which Trump\n\u201c\nClean energy projects also depend on critical minerals that disproportionately come from China, which has\nTo make things more complicated, the raw materials and subcomponents that modern industries like EV\n## Ranking the risks to solar, wind, and batteries\nDespite this complexity, some predictions can be made. One key distinction is between solar and wind power, sectors where tariffs either already exist or may have less impact, and lithium-ion batteries, which will be subject to far higher tariffs than ever before.\nDespite a rapid expansion of domestic solar-manufacturing capacity, the U.S. remains dependent on imports \u2014 and most of the world\u2019s 2449\nBut solar developers in the U.S. are already acclimated to more than a decade of\nOn the one hand, this has \u201c\nOn the other, it has also normalized high costs for imported products in the industry, somewhat softening the blow of the new tariffs.

Last year, the Biden administration 7525\nThough U.S. battery manufacturing has expanded dramatically in recent years, the overwhelming majority of lithium-ion batteries and components are still imported \u2014 and China supplied more than two-thirds of those imports last year, according to BloombergNEF.\nIncreased costs for lithium-ion batteries, components, and materials will ripple across the power sector. Automakers will be hit hard, too, since batteries are the most expensive parts of EVs.\nEver-cheaper lithium-ion batteries have become an important part of the power mix in states like California and Texas, where they\u2019re shifting gigawatts of solar power from daytime to evening to mitigate grid stresses and take the place of fossil gas\u2013fired generation.\nThe Biden administration set a lower tariff of 1020262560\nSolar and batteries are the cheapest source of new grid capacity across most of the country and can\u2019t be built fast enough to meet rising electricity demand from data centers, factories, electric vehicles, and general economic growth.

(Carlos Avila Gonzalez\/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images)\nOne of the biggest grid batteries in California almost resumed operations Sunday following the cataclysmic Moss Landing fire in January.\nThe San Francisco Bay Area\u2019s power grid used to draw on two battery storage plants in the quiet seaside town of Moss Landing. Texas-based power company Vistra built the nation\u2019s largest standalone grid battery on the grounds of an old gas power plant there, and utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co. built and owns the Elkhorn project next door.\nA roaring fire engulfed Vistra\u2019s historic turbine hall in January, wrecking rows of lithium-ion batteries that delivered 300PG&PG&\n\u201c1256\u201c\nPG&\nHad the operation succeeded, it would have returned 1825730\n\u201cPG&\u201c\nIndeed, California has been building grid batteries at a record pace, to store the state\u2019s nation-leading solar generation and deliver it during crucial hours, like after sunset. The tech is displacing some gas-fired power generation in the state. California\u2019s battery fleet passed 157\u201c157 threshold merits particular attention, but it does mean California has added more than 5GWcrossed the 10 mark a year prior.\n\u201c\nThe state\u2019s battery buildout is plowing ahead. But Vistra\u2019s fiery failure sparked deep community concerns about battery safety in 600 battery in Morro Bay, two hours down the coast from Moss Landing, following significant local resistance\nEven before the unsuccessful restart, the plan to revive Elkhorn had rekindled concerns among community leaders who are still grappling with the fallout from the largest-ever battery fire in the U.S., and quite possibly the world. The Monterey County Board of Supervisors had asked to keep both battery plants offline until the Vistra investigation was completed and acted upon.\n\u201cPG&\n## **PG &**\nCrucially, PG&2022\nOfficials have not yet pinpointed the cause of Vistra\u2019s fire, but it became so destructive because it spread through the densely packed rows of batteries in the old turbine hall, igniting more and more fuel as it grew. By contrast, PG&256\n\u201c\u201c\nThat industry-wide preference for separate, containerized systems doesn\u2019t eliminate the chance of battery fires, but it does limit the potential severity. One container might burn, but the fire can\u2019t reach all the other batteries. A fire could knock a facility offline temporarily, but it would only eliminate a small percentage of its capacity, Murtishaw said. That stands in contrast to Moss Landing\u2019s failure, or the all-or-nothing issues that can occur when a gas-burning turbine malfunctions.\n\u201ctechnology and standards have changed considerably since the first big batteries,\u201d like Vistra\u2019s, Murtishaw said. \u201c\nThat compartmentalization strategy worked out when Elkhorn suffered its own battery fire in 2022\nSince that incident, PG&PG&\nWhen Vistra\u2019s plant burned up in January, Elkhorn\u2019s thermal imaging cameras spotted it and automatically severed the connection to the grid, halting the flow of high-voltage power out of the site.

Workers also cleaned the Megapacks \u201c\n## Many more batteries on the horizon\nAnother 1025522045SB100\nTo achieve that goal, the Moss Landing calamity needs to remain an outlier event. There\u2019s good reason to believe that will be the case. For one thing, the industry has all but abandoned Vistra\u2019s strategy of packing huge amounts of batteries into a single building.\nCalifornia now has 21410\nSmall-scale batteries in homes and businesses also count for California\u2019s top-line storage goal.

(Samuel Corum\/Getty Images)\nPresident Donald Trump got his \u201c\nThe One Big, Beautiful Bill Act is a law not of creation but destruction. It\u2019s the antithesis of former President Joe Biden\u2019s Build Back Better Act, which was ultimately pared down into the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022\nIt eliminates a set of subsidies that have, over decades, helped solar and wind mature from niche technologies to cornerstones of our power grid. It scraps tax credits for rooftop solar, electric vehicles, and heat pumps, making it more expensive for the average person to buy these cleaner options. It threatens to pull the rug out from under manufacturers who, encouraged by the incentives created by the Inflation Reduction Act, had chosen to build new factories to make products like solar panels and lithium-ion batteries in the United States.\nJobs will be lost. Energy will get even more expensive. Billions more tons of carbon dioxide\nThough dozens of congressional Republicans voiced their support for various clean energy subsidies in recent months \u2014 and though Republican congressional districts benefit most from the manufacturing boom the incentives have created \u2014 Trump\u2019s signature legislation ultimately faced almost no resistance. Browbeaten by the president, every GOPSen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who had announced his retirement days before.\n## Progress made, progress lost?\nIn effect, the new law repeals much of the Inflation Reduction Act, a landmark law that was not only helping the United States reduce its carbon emissions, but also gave the country a much-needed injection of industrial policy. It was a rare, coherent attempt to marshal the might of the U.S. government to boost an industry \u2014 in this case, clean energy \u2014 deemed critical to national interests.\nThat policy was working.\nAfter the law went into effect and introduced a new subsidy for clean-energy factories, the long-stagnant U.S. manufacturing and industrial base began to undergo a remarkable revitalization.\nFirms 100EV115000new aluminum smelter in the U.S. in 45same program spurred plans for futuristic new steel plants that would operate without coal. The Trump administration dismantled that program in May, and the fate of those projects remains unclear.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act greatly accelerated the development of clean energy. This trend was underway before Biden\u2019s law went into effect, thanks to a pair of tax credits, one of which dates back to George H. W. Bush\u2019s administration and the other of which to the second term of George W. Bush. Biden\u2019s signature climate law took these existing policies and expanded them, turbocharging the already-rapid rise of renewables. The results speak for themselves: As of last year the U.S. now gets more electricity from wind and solar than from coal. Big grid batteries have helped Texas and\nNow, with the repeal of those and other incentives, it\u2019s expected that the U.S. will plug somewhere between 5772nearly all new electricity capacity built in the U.S., it\u2019s unclear what, if anything, would fill in that gap. It won\u2019t be new gas-fueled plants \u2014 the energy inflation Americans are already dealing with.\nThe timing could not be worse. Around the country, demand for electricity is anticipated to grow at a pace not seen in years. One of the biggest drivers is the proliferation of data centers that underpin increasingly popular AIas much power as a small city. Making energy scarce right when it\u2019s needed most will put even more upward pressure on power bills.

The U.S. under Trump has hitched itself to fossil fuels, to combustion, to literally ancient forms of energy that more forward-thinking countries will be leaving behind in the coming decades.

The State govt. has proven completely incompetent at seeing the big picture and are not prepared for what is coming just around the corner. The big 3 have pushed them around for years, but in the end, the customer will have the last say. As it is today their prices are 2x those in other states as well as 2x the price of the municipal utilities within the State.\nIt's just a matter of time at this point where competing solutions allow significant numbers of utility customers to go solar with battery storage. Removing NM 1.0 and 2.0 contracts only hastens existing customers to add battery storage. And for every additional customer that adds solar and storage, fewer kW's need be supplied by the Utility Company, forcing them to raise rates.\nSolar and battery storage are not going away. They become more cost effective with each passing year. And the whole monopoly utility system cost structure is dependent on 100% participation, remove 5 or 10% of the customers and you'll find them in the catch 22 of increasing cost for remaining customers which results in further erosion of participation.\nCalifornia has already passed that point, with about 15% of customers implementing behind the meter solar. And as a result, we've seen the response of the IOU's and the State accommodating all the rate increases they've requested.\nBased on current political trends, with poor decisions being made at the State level in support of the IOU's the only solution in the near future will be State bailout. I'd estimate we might be there within the next 5 years, and certainly will if NM 1 and 2 contracts are broke. Certainly by 2040 the IOU's will be the last option of choice for customers, based on current price trends.\nEven today, the reality is the only thing the utility offers at this point for a significant portion of customers is energy security: when a customers solar production is low, which in CA is typically winter months when a winter storm blows through. But today's new EV's are already capable of being used for backup \/ energy security, when solar panels are not enough.\nD\n0 points\n6 months ago\nReneging on a contract is wrong and I'm sure will just waste money on litigation. I would like to see more support\/incentives for household battery uptake.\nGrid operators face a very serious operational challenge when confronted by unconstrained and uncontrollable input of power from distributed sources. Batteries can greatly ease this stress by balancing generation and load through time shifting. It should also reduce the extent of grid hardening to accomodate greater electric loads.\nI think it would be fairer if I was charged a fixed fee to cover all of the connection infrastructure (grid) and a TOU fee for consumption and export. Everyone connected to the grid should cover the infrastructure cost. I'd guess a fair way might be to scale the annual connection fee per residence based on the maximum power passing through a residence's connection in either direction during a year. But great care must be taken by the regulatory agencies to prevent gold-plating of grid infrastructure because no business can be expected to ignore a taxpayer\/customer guaranteed rate of return on capital expenditure.\nE\nEduardo Pelegri\n0 points\n6 months ago\nI am on board with charging for maximum demand. That's how it works in Europe - there is a per-day fixed cost that depends on the demand.\nAustralia has a very large penetration of rooftop solar and they are ahead of California in trying to address this problem. They are currently trying two-way tariffs, and dynamic exports. In the first, the export rate and schedule is different to the inport rate and schedule. In the latter, a house cannot export if the grid believes it is not useful to the grid.\nWe could start by having a more rational TOU schedule. Right now we are paying less to import in the middle of the night, when the grid is very dirty, than at 4pm, when the grid is very clean.\n![](\nMike Larski\n0 points\n6 months ago\nThanks Newsom\nJ\nJim Lazar\n0 points\n6 months ago\nIt seems to me that this proposed legislation violates the Contracts Clause of the US Constitution, which provides that no state may pass any law that impairs existing contracts.\nIt's one thing to change the game for new solar customers. That's not good, but it's legal. It's another thing to retroactively change the terms of a contract signed long ago.\nI'm surprised that the Legislative Counsel has not advised that this legislation is invalid on its face.\nT\nTom Tuna\n0 points\n6 months ago\nWhat if the solar rooftop owners were to boycott by turning off their solar panels for a day or maybe a week in let\u2019s say late September. I think the utility companies would quickly value the solar owners and their contributions.. what are your thoughts\nE\nEduardo Pelegri\n0 points\n6 months ago\nTempting but too dangerous. I am afraid we would crash the grid.\nIt would be VERY useful if we could quantify accurately the number, though. Perhaps the CalSSA can spend some $$s and provide a reasonable approximation?\nB\nBruce Schmith\n0 points\n6 months ago\nIf the 3 investor-owned power utility companies (SDG&E, SCE & PG&E) were that altruistic they should agree in writing to lower rates for non-solar customers if this bill passes (or better yet, provide no interest loans to non-solar customers who want solar but can't afford the upfront cost), but they won't, because this is really about maintaining the exhorbitant salaries they pay their executives and the excessive 10+ percent profit margin they want when they really have a no-risk business because any losses (including those from wildfires) just get passed on to their customers. Investor-owned power utility companies were necessary at one time in this Country when large amounts of capital were needed to build power plants and expand transmission lines. But now that most of that infrastructure is built and rooftop solar can be generated at a small capital cost (rather than having to construct capital-intensive power plants), investor-owned power utility companies should be no different than other utilities, like water for example (think LA MWD).\nT\nTimothy K\n0 points\n6 months ago\nIf the energy companies are truly trying to save consumers money on electricity costs, and not just trying to increase profits, then why not set up a type of CO-OP where solar producers (ie homeowners or other businesses) could sell their excess energy production to other energy users? Yes, I would get less than my current retail rate, but more than the proposed wholesale rate. The energy purchasers would be getting a cheaper rate than the standard retail rate.

(Dustin Chambers for The Washington Post via Getty Images)\nThe American solar manufacturing renaissance was charging ahead. Then President Donald Trump took the reins.\nSince Trump resumed occupancy of the White House, promising to bring back manufacturing jobs, new investment in clean energy factories has plummeted from its Biden-era highs, and factory cancellations have surged instead. Now, with Trump\u2019s signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this month, things are about to get even rockier for clean energy manufacturers \u2014 but several of the leading firms reshoring solar panel production still see reasons for qualified hope.\nThat\u2019s not to say the path ahead will be easy. The law swings a battle-axe through the clean energy incentives that were carefully crafted by Democrats in the 2022disappear after 2027. Now, the U.S. will install somewhere between 20252035need vastly more electricity over that timeframe \u2014 not to mention the climate \u2014 but it also portends a shrinking market for American manufacturers to sell into.\n\u201c\u201c\nBut for manufacturers who have kickstarted a stunning reshoring of the solar supply chain after years of decline, the legislation\u2019s final form is not nearly as dire as some earlier drafts. Chiefly, Republicans preserved the flagship manufacturing credit, which pays a company for each unit they make of key clean-energy components.\n\u201cCEO13\u201c\nThe one major change the law did make to the manufacturing tax credit was to add in \u201cFEOCFEOC\nTake the case of T1120003FEOC\u201c\n\u201c\u201c\nDean Solon, the billionaire solar entrepreneur who has manufactured connectors and cabling systems in Tennessee since the dawn of the modern solar industry, seemed unconcerned when I asked him in June about whether the new FEOC\n\u201cFEOC\nFor now, solar manufacturers that have factories operating or nearly operational can squint and see a good few years ahead while the tax credits are still accessible, though after that, it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess. Companies that were about to commit to the multiyear effort to build new factories, however, just got an undeniable signal from Congress to take their jobs and economic dynamism elsewhere.\n\u201c\n## Weathering slower solar demand\nSomewhat improbably, Trump\u2019s signature policy effort let the Biden-era 45 clean energy manufacturing credit continue as planned before phasing down after 20302033\nUnlike the earlier House version, Gold noted, the law preserves transferability, which lets factories monetize their credits when they lack sufficient tax burden themselves; factories cost a lot up front before they start making money, so this is especially useful in their early years. Factories almost lost stackability, which guarantees credits for companies that produce several steps of the supply chain, but the final text preserved that, Gold added.\n\u201c45, which is what solar manufacturers do receive, it is exactly like what was included in the Inflation Reduction Act and proposed by Sen. Ossoff in the Build Back Better days,\u201d Pochtaruk said.\nThat has direct implications for a solar cell factory Pochtaruk was developing somewhere in the U.S. but put on hold after the election as he waited to see if 45 would survive. Now that its fate is clear, Heliene can return to developing that factory, if the company determines it still makes sense in the new market landscape.\nThe major lingering concern for solar manufacturers is what happens next with their customers. The law, after all, attacks the demand-side credits that were designed to stimulate purchases of made-in-America solar products.\nThe early demise of the solar deployment credits will hit manufacturers in two major ways.\nFirst, with the stroke of Trump\u2019s pen, the amount of clean energy projects expected to come online in the U.S. over the next decade just dropped. Demand for the American factories that opened up to serve that market just took a commensurate hit. Americans pay a lot more for solar panels than the rest of the world, due to the trade protectionism in place to help factories here; thus, U.S.-made solar is for U.S. consumers, and can\u2019t readily export to foreign markets if domestic demand suddenly drops.\nSecond, in destroying the solar deployment credits, Republicans also eliminated the domestic content adder, a bonus incentive that encouraged developers to pick domestic equipment over cheap imports.\n\u201c\u201c\nMarta Stoepker, a spokesperson for Qcells, which runs the largest solar-module factory in the U.S., located in Dalton, Georgia, corroborated the importance of that policy for encouraging domestic purchases.\n\u201c\nThat said, the new megabill might leave a path for solar installations to continue at a healthy clip for the next five years. It\u2019s the five years after that when solar could fall off a cliff.\nUnder the new law, solar developers need to start building their projects between now and July 420263020271FEOCIRS5\nThat timeline, then, could support something close to the recent high level of solar deployment into 203034T15\nIf the market follows the pattern from previous times Congress was set to end solar incentives, developers will rush to safe-harbor projects before the deadline, fast-tracking work that could have been spaced out over the next few years. Then they\u2019ll have several more years to buy the rest of the project equipment, giving domestic factories more time to spin up.\nNonetheless, factories will have to navigate upheaval among their customers in the mad dash to lock in these incentives. Larger developers can afford to hustle and start a number of projects in the next year to secure the full tax credit. Smaller developers typically finish and sell projects to finance their next efforts, a strategy that could be foiled by this truncated timeline.\n\u201c\n## Unknowns ahead: Political cudgels and the post-ITC era\nBesides the impending blows to domestic demand, a few other variables could skew the fate of the solar manufacturing renaissance.\nFor one thing, manufacturers will have to navigate the new FEOC45 manufacturing credit. The firms who spoke with Canary Media said that, right now, doing so seems manageable, but a lot depends on how the final IRS. The Treasury Department has until the end of 2026\nDespite the uncertainty, some are very confident they\u2019ll make do.\n\u201c\u201c\nNot everyone is so sanguine.

Companies bidding to construct new public buildings or bridges must show they can not only compete on cost but also on the carbon intensity of their concrete or steel, which in turn creates demand for more cleanly produced products.\nToday, states are largely still laying the foundation for this future reality.\nThe first place many agencies start is by requiring suppliers to furnish\nIn 2021\nWaterstrat said her team has since developed specifications and language for companies to follow to ease the process of bidding on projects. Her office is also working on a database for EPDs to show the carbon intensity of the materials the state procures and to inform future policymaking. Eventually, the idea is to set limits around products\u2019 carbon footprints \u2014 but for now, the state\u2019s law doesn\u2019t call for that.\n\u201c\u201c\nA handful of states that are gathering EPDs also require construction products to meet certain emissions thresholds, which are known as global warming potential limits.\nIn 20222024\nNew York, for its part, set GWP2023150\u201c\u201c\nHowever, starting in 2027\u201c\n## Pressing on without a key partner\nThe ability to gather accurate data from many disparate suppliers is essential to achieving the ultimate goal of Buy Clean: slashing embodied carbon from construction materials.\nThat work will potentially get harder if the Trump administration succeeds in its attempts to claw back congressionally mandated climate and energy spending.\nAmong the funding stuck in political purgatory is a nearly \u201c14\nThe 1030006000\nWillis said the EPA\u201c\n\u201c\nA $12 from the Federal Highway Administration is similarly ensnared in Trump\u2019s funding freeze.

That\u2019s a problem, said Hua, because a lack of public participation prevents consumer interests from being fully considered when state regulators receive and approve rate-hike requests from utilities.\nIn the survey, 6090\nMeanwhile, these relatively unknown regulators have approved ballooning utility cost increases in recent years. In 202244202397202520302021402019\nThe reasons behind these fast-rising rates vary by utility and state. Still, Hua singled out one driver of higher electricity rates in particular: utility spending on transmission lines and distribution systems \u2014 in other words, the poles, wires, and lines that deliver power to customers.\nUtilities have spent increasing amounts of money to replace aging infrastructure and repair or harden the grid after storms, wildfires, and other disasters made more likely by climate change. State rules guarantee investor-owned utilities a rate of return on those investments, creating a financial incentive to overspend on grid infrastructure that some researchers have estimated costs consumers\nThe extent to which customers are suffering proves that the current regulatory system isn\u2019t working, said Hua. \u201c\nHouseholds that struggle to afford utilities often have no choice but to sacrifice needs like food, medicine, or basic physical comfort in order to pay their energy bills. Total utility bill debt in the U.S. has reached $17\nFour in five respondents to the poll said they felt powerless to control increasing utility costs. Around 60\nFor that to change, public utility commissions need to better engage the communities they serve, said Hua.\nThey could, for example, hold public meetings virtually or at night so that more people can attend, he said. Commissions could also allow consumers to comment on regulatory proceedings online or in person, and could provide intervenor compensation that covers the legal fees of advocates and stakeholders so that more groups can get involved in ratemaking cases. Hua added that states should invest in expanding the staff and capacity of public utility commissions and consumer advocacy offices, which are often vastly out-resourced by large investor-owned utilities.\nOther consumer advocates have called for a range of reforms to rein in high rates, such as implementing performance-based ratemaking, which rewards utilities for reaching certain environmental or equity goals. States could also prohibit utilities from charging customers for trade association and lobbying fees, and lower the rate of return utilities can earn on infrastructure investments.\nElectricity and gas bills may rise even more under the Trump administration\u2019s energy policies. Several reports have found that repealing the clean energy tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, which some GOPsignificantly raise household energy costs, given that solar and wind are now far cheaper sources of electricity than coal, oil, and gas. President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs \u2014 now aging, unprofitable coal power plants running would make energy costs even more unaffordable.\nThe administration has also targeted a popular federal assistance program that helps more than 6\n\u201c\n* Utilities\n* Policy & regulation\nAkielly Hu is a freelance journalist and contributing reporter for Canary Media.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\nUpvotesNewestOldest\nE\nEduardo Pelegri\n0 points\n6 months ago\n> Hua added that states should invest in expanding the staff and capacity of public utility commissions and consumer advocacy offices, which are often vastly out-resourced by large investor-owned utilities.\n100% agree. Reach out to your representative and reinforce that message - the PUCs need more people, and people with additional skills, to handle the complexities raising from our ongoing energy transition.\nE\nEduardo Pelegri\n0 points\n6 months ago\nGood article, like always.\nThe best way for consumers to address energy costs is to use distributed energy resources: solar panels and storage. These resources should be compensated properly by the regulators but, even if they are not, like with NBT in California, they help a lot with electricity bills. The biggest challenges are; cost of installation - should be no more than $2\/watt, connection complexities - let's adopt collars and smart inverters, and lack of useful real estate, like shaded roofs, renters, or multi-family buildings. The latter could be solved with Community Solar.\nCommunity Solar has had a bad history in California. The latest approach is AB-1260. Let's hope that will get through the legislature and that Newsom will not veto it.\nM\nMarshall Ambros\n0 points\n6 months ago\nIt's my understanding that to bring more wind and solar power online, more and improved transmission lines are required. This article explicitly states that our rates are increasing because of the work being done on transmission lines. I am confused: how can wind and solar be least expensive form of grid energy if grid buildout to support wind and solar is what is causing our utility rates to go up so much? I would appreciate if Canary Media wrote an article that clarified the all-in $\/KW cost comparison of, say, building a NG plant that requires no additional grid buildout vs a solar+storage that requires building new or upgraded transmission lines.\n## read next\n* ![Gray metal boxes lined up with a blue sky overhead ](\nBatteries\n### California has a new law to prevent big grid battery fires\n* ![Aerial shot of a large warehouse complex next to homes ](\nVirtual power plants\n### Can crowdsourcing help solve the data-center power crunch?\n* ![A large ship with cargo at a port ](\nMarine transport\n### Global rules to decarbonize ships delayed amid Trump\u2019s pushback\n* ![ ](\nPolitics\n### The DOE\u2019s loan office enters its \u2018energy dominance\u2019 era\n![](",

(Hycamite)\nA 67\nThe plant, in the industrial port city of Kokkola, on Finland\u2019s west coast, will soon receive gas shipments from a nearby liquefied natural gas import terminal and turn the fossil fuel into hydrogen. That in itself is not novel \u2014 pretty much all of the world\u2019s commercially produced hydrogen comes from methane, the main ingredient in natural gas. But all those legacy hydrogen producers end up with carbon dioxide as a byproduct, and they vent it into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change. Hycamite will make hydrogen without releasing CO2, using a little-known process called methane pyrolysis.\n\u201cCO2 emissions at all,\u201d founder and Chairman Matti Malkam\u00e4ki told Canary Media in a December interview. \u201c\nHycamite\u2019s Customer Sample Facility in Kokkola can produce 55200020\u201c\n![]( Hycamite's founder and chairman, Matti Malkam\u00e4ki.

In the U.S., some hydrogen producers and fossil fuel majors have talked about retrofitting carbon-capture machinery onto existing hydrogen plants, but nobody\u2019s built a full-scale \u201c\u201c\nNow President Donald Trump is treating Joe Biden\u2019s suite of clean energy policies like a pi\u00f1ata, and it\u2019s hard to tell if incentives for producing green hydrogen will even survive. That\u2019s already scaring off investors from large, capital-intensive green hydrogen projects. But the up-and-coming pyrolysis crew could find a niche: Their projects are smaller and nimbler, and they consume natural gas, one sector that Trump has ordered his government to encourage.\n## Turning gas into clean energy gold\nMethane pyrolysis entrepreneurs like Malkam\u00e4ki are heeding the call of fundamental chemistry.\n\u201c\nNot only does methane-splitting require less energy, it can be done with a simpler plant design than water electrolysis, using fewer moving parts or fragile pieces of equipment, Singhania noted. This\nThose thermodynamic advantages come with tradeoffs. Namely, would-be methane pyrolyzers need a ready source of methane, which in practical terms means a pipe delivering fossil gas. That inevitably entails some level of upstream emissions.\nMethane pyrolyzers also need to be located where gas is abundant. It\u2019d be hard to scale up in places like Europe, post Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, or\nRight after taking office in January, Trump responded to world records in U.S. fossil fuel production by declaring an\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the fossil fuel industry can or wishes to increase production dramatically; in market-based systems, excess supply tends to deflate prices. Whether production stays at current record highs or pushes further skyward, the U.S. will have plenty of gas to go around, and methane pyrolysis companies could generate the kind of new demand that the industry desperately needs. Moreover, they would be using American fossil fuel abundance to create materials useful for the transition to clean energy.\nFor that to happen, though, pyrolysis startups need to break through early technical demonstrations and start producing at scale.\n## Out of the lab and into the fray\nHycamite is not the only company chasing the pyrolysis dream.\nThe American startup\nMonolith received a conditional $1 in late 2021DOEtire for electric vehicles\nHowever, Monolith did not finalize the loan before the Trump administration came to office and froze new disbursements for clean energy. The company was running short on cash while struggling to get its high-heat process to work reliably around the clock, per a Wall Street Journal\nSeveral other startups want to boost their revenues by turning methane into higher-value forms of carbon than carbon black, a relatively inexpensive commodity \u2014 if they can achieve the quality and consistency necessary to sell into those specialized and demanding markets.\nA group of Cambridge University scientists founded 20122004\nLevidian eschews the catalysts, heat, and pressure that other startups use to split methane. Instead, the team ended up building a nozzle that sucks in methane gas, then uses electricity to generate microwave energy, which in turn creates a cold plasma torch that shaves carbon atoms from hydrogen atoms.\nThis yields hydrogen and graphene, which can be used in semiconductors, electronics, and batteries. Levidian can sell graphene for hundreds of dollars per kilogram, far more than carbon black, CEO24\n\u201c\nU.S.-based\nThe Etch team is wrapping up commissioning for its first \u201cCEOactually producing low-carbon hydrogen at scale, and a key player in six of the seven hydrogen hubs funded by the Department of Energy.\n## Steps toward scale in uncertain times\nAll these companies need to hit their stride just as the clean hydrogen market has entered a period of tumult.\nThe Biden administration hoped to jump-start a clean hydrogen economy with two major policies: A suite of billion-dollar grants to seven \u201c strategically chosen around the country, which are intended to link up production with entities that could use the fuel to clean up transportation and heavy industry, and a production tax credit to effectively lower the market price of hydrogen produced using low-carbon methods.\nNow, the Trump administration has frozen payments on clean energy grants and loans. Prospective hydrogen producers had been waiting breathlessly for the final IRS45 tax credit; now that the lawyers have finally produced that guidance, the nascent hydrogen industry has to plead with the new administration to preserve those credits as it overhauls federal spending this year.\nGiven this swirling uncertainty, pyrolysis startups can take some solace in the fact that their business is not entirely dependent on the vagaries of hydrogen policy. At least they can sell carbon materials, which have clear value and established buyers who use the stuff in a non-theoretical way.\nI asked Malkam\u00e4ki if Hycamite identifies as a carbon company that also makes hydrogen or a hydrogen company that also makes carbon. He pointed out that the company name itself is a mashup of \u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\nThat\u2019s not to suggest breaking into the battery supply chain will be easy. It requires passing rigorous, multi-year testing by the battery makers that might buy Hycamite\u2019s carbon products. But this kind of revenue can bolster a young business as it rides out the storm in Washington.\n* Hydrogen\n* Fossil fuels\n* Methane\nJulian Spector is a senior reporter at Canary Media.

    "content":"The agrivoltaics demonstration project is experimenting with growing crops under solar panels to determine what works and help educate a wary public.\n![](\nBy Elizabeth Ouzts\n14 October 2025\n* *\n!Aerial shot of rows of solar panels with people working on raised gardening beds in between\nThe Piedmont Environmental Council recently installed 42 solar panels at its community farm in Loudoun County, Virginia, where it will test the impact on crops. (Hugh Kenny\/Piedmont Environmental Council)\nMore than a decade ago, residents of Loudoun County, Virginia, banded together to buy up treasured open space before it became a strip mall and housing development, donating the land to the Piedmont Environmental Council instead. The nonprofit has maintained it as a unique blend of cattle pasture, a nature preserve, and a community farm that donates its yield to a local food pantry.\nNow, a small corner of the farm has become what organizers say is a first for the state: a crop-based agrivoltaics demonstration project. They hope the combination of solar panels and vegetable farming will showcase how much-needed renewable energy can complement, not harm, agricultural lands, at a time when data centers are demanding more and more electricity.\nThe Virginia Clean Economy Act requires the state\u2019s largest utility, Dominion Energy, to stop burning fossil fuels by 2045161002035\nVirginia has more than enough room to meet that target without threatening great swaths of farmland. Using a conservative metric that 101402\u201c\nResearchers from Virginia Commonwealth University determined that large-scale solar today is erected on \u201c203512\u201c\nIn fact, many landowners find that renting a portion of their land to solar companies can help their farming enterprise pencil out financially, reducing pressure to sell their property to developers. An acre of land, after all, may yield hundreds of dollars if devoted to crops but thousands if leased for panels.\nAnd yet there\u2019s no doubt that solar has grown exponentially in the state in the last decade, and that it has disproportionately displaced farmland. Cropland makes up 528\nEspecially in the early years of renewable-energy construction, some companies set a poor example for responsible development, said Ashish Kapoor, senior energy and climate advisor with the Piedmont Environmental Council. \u201c\u2018\u201c20182019\nAs solar fields have gone up at a breakneck pace \u2014 replacing plots of forests as well as farmland \u2014 opposition to them has also grown.

The most common application is sheep: They graze on vegetation beneath the panels and prevent the need for expensive and polluting mowers. Planting flowers in and around panels to supply honeybees and other pollinators is also popular.\nStill, the Piedmont Environmental Council team wanted to experiment with a crop-based model because it fits better with what most farmers in the area are doing now: raising vegetables.\n\u201c\n!Small plants pop up in between two rows of solar panels against a blue partly cloudy sky The Piedmont Environmental Council is growing vegetables in the ground and in raised beds around its solar panels in Loudoun County, Virginia. (Hugh Kenny\/Piedmont Environmental Council)\nOccupying a quarter-acre section of the nonprofit\u2019s 842172000\nThe array will supply more than enough power to meet the farm\u2019s needs, with additional headroom for a planned EV\nWith the shade and protection from rainwater that they provide, how do the solar panels affect soil moisture and temperature? What\u2019s the resulting crop yield? What do vegetables grown beneath and near solar panels look like, and how will consumers react? Do any contents from the panels make their way into the crops, posing health problems?\nMost research has found that the answer to the last question is no. But the team still plans to test for contaminants in response to public concern as a show of good faith and transparency, and in an effort to address any potential barriers to agrivoltaics from the get-go.\nWhile most crop-based agrivoltaics projects involve growing produce in the ground, the Piedmont Environmental Council\u2019s farm also includes raised beds, which enable educational tours and widen the demonstration project\u2019s relevance.\nThe beds do increase costs, said Pitsiokos.

However, I own a solar company and hope to one day build agrivoltaic arrays (NOT an awkward portmanteau), and I find the design of this experiment to leave a few things to be desired.\nFirst, to produce valuable data, I feel they need to start with the irradiance the ground will receive over the course of a day based on the density of shade the panels will create--taking license with the word, \"opacity,\" delineate a plane above a field and think of it as the \"irradiance control plane.\" Use the properties of solar panels and arrays thereof to calculate\/estimate the irradiance and\/or density of photons (light and thermal, if possible) that will reach the soil. Factors to consider include the translucence of a panel's backing sheet--clear, white, or black; then, the spacing of the panels, both laterally in a row and between rows. Consider if they are mounted right next to one another as in a residential roof array, 6\" apart, 12\" apart, 2', 3', 4', up to whatever spacing is the equivalent of having no shade whatsoever. I'm guessing a version of a checkerboard pattern will find its way into use. Connect this analysis with the shade tolerance of various crops.\nThe methodology to capture this data MUST take into account the types of machines used to work the land to till, sow, irrigate, spray, and harvest the crop itself. No one is going to buy all new tractors just to accommodate a solar array that can take any form required to accommodate existing farm equipment. Figure that the panels will be higher off the ground than typical ground mounts, but that foundations, anchors, and panel-stowing hardware can be designed to handle wind uplift and snow loads. Also consider that the dimensions of panels could be changed by a manufacturer to affect the nature of the shade they will create. Similarly, perhaps the arrays themselves could be mobile\/designed to be moved every so many years as part of crop rotation cycles.\nAlso, see if the analysis can account for the capabilities solar support structures can introduce to meet existing agricultural production needs: irrigation lines can be installed from overhead structures and might use less water than existing sprinkler methods, as mentioned in the article, the shade from the panels might reduce water use, and perhaps, the irrigation system could be designed to include sprayer heads that would clean the panels to boost electricity production at the same time that crops are being irrigated.\nThe essential data point to capture is making 100% certain that NO chemicals, metals, or other compounds are leeching from the panels or any component of the system. No one will want to eat food grown underneath them otherwise. Beyond that, water needs, soil moisture, soil temperature, degree of protection from heavy rain, UV damage, and stress from heat waves; crop yield, and power yield from the panels are also important.\nThank you for taking the time to consider this comment.\n## read next\n* ![Gray metal boxes lined up with a blue sky overhead ](\nBatteries\n### California has a new law to prevent big grid battery fires\n* ![Aerial shot of a large warehouse complex next to homes ](\nVirtual power plants\n### Can crowdsourcing help solve the data-center power crunch?\n* ![A large ship with cargo at a port ](\nMarine transport\n### Global rules to decarbonize ships delayed amid Trump\u2019s pushback\n* ![ ](\nPolitics\n### The DOE\u2019s loan office enters its \u2018energy dominance\u2019 era\n![](",

I believe I read here at Canary that about 99% of all new power to come on line in the US last year was green. It is unlikely that that will change significantly, without the subsidies because they just aren't needed - or at the least, are barely needed compared to five or ten years ago, when solar panels were noticeably less efficient, and grid batteries which dramatically improve reliability of power, basically didn't exist.\nPlus we have the non-utility private sector almost exclusively planning green power for data centers, and AI.\nAnd without the heavy subsidies we'll also end up with less boondoggles - wasted billions. The poster child for that waste is the Ivanpah, on the CA\/NV border. Its mirrored oil heating solar system (no solar panels) was marginally efficient when completed just over 10 years, ago, but now is far, far, more expensive per KW than anything new. Looks like it will be shuttered before it even reaches half of it's minimum life expectancy when built, because the utilities can't afford to pay that much for electric, when new solar is half the price or less.\nAt least a traditional solar farm could easily replace aging less efficient solar panels with newer ones. But Ivanpah, also excellent at killing wild life including eagles, has proven to be a terrible investment. This is exactly the kind of thing that can happen when the government throws money out in large quantities as subsidies. \"Everything looks great\" until reality sets in.\nAnyone think new solar installations aren't going to soar in 2025? Wind is another issue. I'm not opposed to wind, although it seems today that while well placed wind farms do cost less than solar, wind isn't likely to keep becoming more efficient whereas solar panels keep improving. There are other solutions, I think that may be better long term than wind turbines (also bird killers). True that in the US wind farms only kill about 1.5 million birds a year, we've barely begun to build out wind, relative to the potential if the US wants to stick with wind.\nI am more hopeful for tidal power, which we haven't mastered yet, but would seem to end up being far more efficient than wind? Not sure about that, but water\/tides will can push turbines a lot harder than wind. Test it. point a large fan at your face. Windy. Now instead point your garden hose at your face. Now that's magnitudes more power hitting your face, or spinning turbines.\nImagine what a series of giant sea floor mounted turbines could generate if placed in a line between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean, with the massive tides spinning those underwater blades. We may not be there yet, but it's possible that such tech could make wind farms obsolete in 10 years +\/-.\nNo matter what the current administration does, the bottom line is green is now more efficient than fossil fuels and demand for electricity is rising, and it's just about all going to be green.\nAnd let's not forget that the states (ie CA) can pick up some of the slack from lost subsidies from the Feds. Finally, I didn't like the chart, because it shows numbers based on Biden's massive, over the top spending, (ie IRA) which is why we are running unsustainable $1.5 Trillion dollar federal deficits. Better would have been a chart showing spending over the past decade, for a better look at what might be sustainable spending.\n## read next\n* ![ ](\nGeothermal\n### California can\u2019t get out of its own way on geothermal\n* ![Profile shot of a woman speaking into a microphone ](\nUtilities\n### Why utility regulators need to do more than call \u2018balls and strikes\u2019\n* ![ ](\nSponsored\n### The case for optimism in America\u2019s energy transition\n* ![Aerial shot of large warehouse surrounded by other buildings ](\nBatteries\n### In a first, a data center is using a big battery to get online faster\n![](",

(Amanda Andrade-Rhoades for The Washington Post via Getty Images)\nIt\u2019s become the animating question in the U.S. electricity industry: How can power-hungry data centers get the energy they need?\nThe obvious answers have proven insufficient. Solar and wind power projects face yearslong wait times to interconnect to constrained grids. Moves to siphon off existing nuclear power to avoid these grid bottlenecks have proven controversial. And building new fossil gas\u2013fired power plants will not only worsen climate change but may simply be impossible on the timeline that data centers require given\nBut there may be faster and cheaper ways to bring lots of clean energy online to match new data center demand \u2014 it just requires some creative thinking.\nOne idea is to couple new clean power with some of the dirtier, if only rarely used, fossil-fuel power plants already connected to the grid \u2014 an approach that, counterintuitively enough, could end up not just faster but cleaner than alternatives.\nThat\u2019s the proposition think tank RMI\u201c\u201c\nThe biggest data centers now being planned across the country by tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft can use hundreds of megawatts to gigawatts of electricity. In some of the country\u2019s biggest data center hot spots, there simply isn\u2019t enough capacity left to connect that much new load right now.\nBut in the \u201cRMI\u201c\nThat could also allow new large-scale clean power projects to connect directly to the data center. Some of those solar, wind, and battery developments are already permitted and awaiting grid interconnection \u2014 and all of them can be built much faster than new gas-fired power plants, according to industry experts. Allowing some of these projects to avoid the interconnection backlogs and grid upgrade costs would get clean power online much faster.\nOf course, few if any data centers can rely solely on the sun and wind to serve their round-the-clock power needs, even with batteries to store some of that power for when demand is highest. That\u2019s where the peaker plant comes in, Varadarajan said.\nPeaker plants can serve as a circuit breaker of sorts between the grid on one side and the new data center and all its clean power and batteries on the other side. When there\u2019s not enough clean power for the data center, \u201c\n!Diagram of power flows between clean energy, data center, gas-fired peaker plant and power grid in a 'power couple' site RMI\nIn that sense, the peaker plants are more like gas-fired backups for a largely clean power mix. It\u2019s a natural fit: Peaker plants are designed to fire up only when the grid really needs them, largely during summer heat waves or winter cold snaps when demand for electricity peaks (\nThat leaves a lot of hours when those plants aren\u2019t using their connections to the grid at large \u2014 which creates an opening for clean power to use them, Varadarajan said. Developers will probably want to \u201c\nImportantly, from the perspective of a utility or grid operator, this setup is potentially far less disruptive than adding a big new load or trying to interconnect a brand-new source of generation, Varadarajan said. Many U.S. grid operators already have rules to allow sites that have grid connections to add different types of generation capacity or to use a power plant\u2019s existing capacity more frequently.\nAnd because the data centers will have all the power they need behind the interconnection point, power couples won\u2019t have to enter the complicated technical and regulatory realm of projects that both inject and draw power from the grid \u2014 a status that can \u201c\n## Modeling the potential \u2014 and price points \u2014 for power couples\nRMI48106088\n!Map of U.S. peaker plant sites that could support nearby clean energy and data center loads RMI\nRMI16040CCGT\u201cRMI\u201c\nAs for cost, RMI50\u201c20030100\nThose prices are higher than what data center developers might expect to secure from utilities with low-cost power, ample grid capacity, and an eagerness for the economic development such customers could bring.

It\u2019s probably simplest in Texas, where a deregulated energy regime has allowed clean energy and batteries to thrive.

The legislation could even force some landowners to let their property be used for carbon dioxide storage.\nThe framework proposed in the twin bills being considered by the state House and Senate starkly contrasts with Ohio\u2019s approach to wind and solar farms, most of which can be blocked by counties.\nInstead, carbon capture and storage projects would follow a process similar to what\u2019s used for oil and gas drilling, in which property owners must allow development on or below their land if enough neighbors support it.\nAt least one large energy company, Tenaska, is already talking to Ohio landowners about obtaining rights to drill wells and store carbon dioxide from industrial and energy operations deep underground. An executive with the firm said the legislation would provide \u201c\n\u201c\nThe company is in discussions with various carbon-emitting businesses, including steel refineries, ethanol plants, and power plants. The\nIn Ohio, Tenaska is eyeing CO2 underground. The three counties are among the state\u2019s top oil and gas producers and have a history of coal mining. Tenaska initially hopes to store captured carbon dioxide in the Knox formation, which ranges from 85001200055008000\nOther carbon sequestration projects could be on the horizon. The Great Plains Institute has identified roughly three dozen industrial facilities across the state as\nOhio\u2019s \u201clocal government regulation of drilling, even through general zoning rules that apply to other businesses.\nIf passed, the bills would similarly deprive counties and townships of any say over sequestration, said Bev Reed, an organizer for the Buckeye Environmental Network. \u201c\nThe bills would also authorize a \u201c\u201c70unitization, which lets oil and gas companies drill through dissenting landowners\u2019 properties.\nThe chief of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources\u2019 oil and gas management division would be required to grant consolidation if it was \u201c\u201c\n\u201c\u201c\nAsked to respond to advocacy groups\u2019 complaints that the process is unfair, Tenaska\u2019s Kairys focused instead on landowners\u2019 potential for income.\n\u201c\u201c\nThe bills call for compensation, but it\u2019s subject to adjustments for the developer\u2019s expenses. Companies in oil and gas unitization cases often get to recoup twice their costs before they have to pay landowners more than the law\u2019s minimum 125HB170SB136\nThe bills are currently in the House Natural Resources Committee and the Senate Energy Committee. Primary sponsors are all Republicans: Sen. Tim Schaffer, Sen. Brian Chavez, Rep. Bob Peterson, and Rep. Monica Robb Blasdel.\n\u201c\u201c\nCritics have dozens of questions, including whether sequestration projects make economic sense and whether they will significantly reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.\n\u201cCO2 and injecting it underground, she noted.\nOther questions deal with feared drops in property values, chemicals used in the carbon sequestration process, and the huge amounts of water that carbon capture technologies require.\nPeople also worry about the potential for carbon dioxide to escape from underground storage or related pipelines, said Randi Pokladnik, an environmental scientist and volunteer for Save Ohio Parks.\nTenaska\u2019s project will include a detailed emergency response plan, Kairys said, adding that carbon dioxide is not flammable. \u201c\nDozens of people were hospitalized in 2020\nCompanies have injected carbon dioxide underground for years to stimulate extra production from oil and gas wells, but it has never been done at the large scale proposed now, Pokladnik said. She worries that gas could migrate upward through fractures in overlying rock layers or other wells, including many old, abandoned oil wells whose locations may be unknown.\n\u201c\nLove Canary Media and find our reporting valuable?

In 20082000MW20153000MW20201139MW\nAroostook County \u2014 with its strong winds and low population density \u2014 has long been considered a prime area for building turbines, but its promise has not been realized. One of the major obstacles has been the lack of transmission lines to carry power from the forests of northern Maine to the lightbulbs and dishwashers of Massachusetts and Connecticut. Most of Aroostook County is served by an electrical system connected only to Canada, with no direct links to any U.S. power grid. Building the needed lines is a complex, costly undertaking that has repeatedly stymied efforts to get wind generation up and spinning.\n\u201c\u201c\nIn 2013EDP250MW2016EDP\nIn the final days of 2022401000 project the financial security it needed to proceed.

There has been a robust response to the request, though most comments were filed confidentially, said Susan Faloon, spokesperson for the Maine Public Utilities Commission. The tentative plan is to open up for proposals by the end of the year, she said.\nWhether the next attempt will be successful hinges on a few factors, starting with its ability to financially weather Republicans\u2019 scaleback of federal clean-energy tax credits and the administration\u2019s continued, evolving hostility to renewable energy projects. Trump halted federal permitting and leasing for wind projects on his first day in office, and although 99\n\u201c\nStill, Pullaro said, history suggests that onshore wind development could survive the blow of losing federal support.

A wind development stands a much better chance of succeeding, he said, if another state commits to buying power from it, giving it a revenue stream it can count on. Getting Massachusetts on board could be even more crucial than federal support, he said.\nMassachusetts is still authorized to enter into another such agreement until the end of the year, and Gov.

(Dukas\/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)\nLASVEGASRE\nThe Trump administration had declared an energy emergency, then set about reducing energy supply by going after renewables projects. The massive spending law yanked nearly seven years of tax credits for wind and solar. The White House arbitrarily halted construction on two major offshore wind farms that had all their permits in order, raising the fear that it might block other fully approved projects. Tariffs have changed the price of parts that go into clean energy equipment on a sometimes weekly basis. The cleantech bankruptcies have been relentless: Powin, Sunnova, Mosaic, Li-Cycle,\n\u201cCEO\nBut when I got to the exhibit hall at the Venetian Expo, it stretched farther than I\u2019d ever seen at a clean energy show, and I heard rumors of additional halls above and below. The exhibitors even sprawled across a sunwashed bridge to Caesar\u2019s Forum, where vendors of flow batteries and other alternative technologies hawked their wares, quite fittingly, from the periphery of the event.\nFinal attendance for the show hit 3700040000\n\u201cRE\u201c\nJudging by this year\u2019s dire headlines, the show\u2019s ebullient atmosphere does not seem entirely rational. Of course, even teetering startups try to project confidence among peers, customers, and especially journalists. And the overstimulated Vegas backdrop inspires a particular strain of optimism, the kind that encourages you to light cash on fire and feel lucky for the opportunity.\nBut after three days of roaming the frenetic halls, I came to see this year\u2019s positive outlook as warranted. The general consensus among conference goers seemed to be that though political headwinds are blowing hard, economic tailwinds are blowing harder. Here are three reasons why I think they are right.\n## Forget policy, look at the markets\nWith the federal tax credits cut short, fewer solar projects will get built, and costs will rise for the ones that still go forward, passing on higher energy bills to American consumers.\nBut, with a little distance from the sting of this summer\u2019s legislative setbacks, many solar and energy storage professionals believe losses in the policy arena are counterbalanced by increasingly rosy outlooks in the marketplace.\n\u201cCEOclean energy financing platform Crux, as we sipped espressos outside the hubbub of the cavernous expo halls.\nJohnson\u2019s company launched as a marketplace for tax credit transferability, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act, but has expanded into other forms of financing, like debt and tax equity. That perch gives him visibility into clean energy project economics and the flows of capital into the sector. He ticked off a series of key factors defining the current energy market: Electricity prices are way up; solar and battery keeps getting cheaper while improving performance; gas prices are rising as the Trump administration promotes exports; gas turbine prices are rising due to intense competition from buyers.\nIn short, it\u2019s a bad time to be someone who uses electricity in America, despite President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promise to cut energy prices. That means, though, that it\u2019s a great time to be someone who sells power.\nEven better for power producers, the biggest new customers \u2014 data centers \u2014 have the price sensitivity of a ravenous grizzly bear. They\u2019re trying, with the enthusiastic support of the White House, to win a global arms race to unlock artificial superintelligence, whatever that means. Facing such civilizational stakes, the hyperscalers aren\u2019t going to quibble over nickels and dimes.\nEven with elevated electricity prices, hyperscalers still have to pay a lot more for the \u201cAI\n\u201c\nSolar is clearly the cheapest source of new electricity production. But what matters most now is speed to market, and here solar and batteries easily trounce all other commercially viable sources of power. Taking mass-produced panels and parts and assembling them in a field is fundamentally easier than constructing a traditional large power plant. And it\u2019s a hell of a lot easier than some of the hyperscalers\u2019 other ideas, like building nonexistent nuclear fusion plants, or nonexistent small modular reactors, or restarting a long-shuttered nuclear reactor at the notorious Three Mile Island plant.\nThese dynamics led some of my fellow conference goers to muse about a counterfactual choice: Would you rather have strong federal policy tailwinds and an unfavorable market, or booming market fundamentals but unfavorable policy? Nine months ago, the industry enjoyed both. Trump ended those good times, but the robust market serves to mollify the pain of his policy attacks.\n## Solar got whacked, but storage is booming\nSEIAfriendly fire from states like California, and large-scale developers are racing to cram in a bumper crop of projects before tax credits disappear next July.

Even so, compliance creates extra work for the American companies trying to expand the capacity of the grid, and the law does not explicitly encourage domestic manufacturing, since the rules are anti-China rather than pro-America.\nTrump\u2019s tariffs also pose a unique threat to storage, because so many of the battery cells used in these projects come from China. The U.S. has only just begun building supply chains for lithium ferrous phosphate, the battery chemistry now favored for grid storage.

Trump supports the resurgence of domestic manufacturing in theory, but his primary tactic for that goal has been frequently shifting and legally dubious tariffs. These policies raise the price for materials that American manufacturers need to make their products and for the equipment required to build new factories, and they undermine the long-term certainty that reassures investors.\nStill, the reshoring of clean energy supply chains has continued, and signs touting FEOC\n![](\nES Foundry built one of the very few solar cell factories in the country, which opened in South Carolina early this year.

Out of the 2518\nClean energy projects are growing in size for a simple reason: economies of scale. It\u2019s far cheaper on a per-watt basis to install a whole lot of panels, turbines, and battery cells all at once than it is to split them up into smaller projects. Thomas points to other drivers of the trend, too, like the fact that it\u2019s simpler to permit and interconnect one big project than multiple smaller ones.\nThe average project size for planned solar, wind, and battery projects is set to climb even higher in the coming years, Thomas found.

    "content":"From Maine to Massachusetts, state officials are targeting clean energy programs as a way to reduce costs for ratepayers. Advocates say it\u2019s shortsighted.\n![](\nBy Sarah Shemkus\n21 March 2025\n* *\n!A person in a collared shirt and baseball cap looks at his phone and stands behind a counter covered with bills.\nUtility bills pile up on the kitchen counter of Winthrop, Maine, resident Michael Harvey. New England states face some of the nation's highest electricity prices. (Gregory Rec\/Portland Portland Press Herald via Getty Images)\nA growing chorus of New England state officials \u2014 and not just Republicans \u2014 is calling for cuts to clean energy programs in an attempt to rein in high electric bills.\nThese efforts are underway everywhere from Maine, where legislators are trying to repeal incentives for rooftop and community solar, to deep-blue Massachusetts, where regulators recently slashed $500\nThe irony, clean energy advocates say, is that many of the investments under threat contribute relatively little to customers\u2019 monthly bills and save everyone money in the long run.\n\u201c\u201c\nConcerns about the cost of energy are not unique to New England, but the region does have the nation\u2019s highest electricity prices outside of California and Hawaii. Compounding the problem, this year\u2019s cold winter increased gas and electric use, driving recent bills to levels many ratepayers and policymakers say are unsustainable.\nPoliticians have responded by pointing a finger at renewable energy and energy efficiency efforts. In Connecticut, Republicans are pushing to weaken the state\u2019s Global Warming Solutions Act, saying the move is necessary to lower prices for residents. In Rhode Island, a Democratic lawmaker has proposed 10\nThough each state\u2019s circumstances are different, advocates argue that it is almost universally true that these intended quick fixes would cost consumers and the environment in the long-run. Solutions exist, they say, that would preserve the long-term benefits clean energy and energy efficiency offer, while also making power less expensive.\n\u201c\n## What makes power so expensive in New England?\nElectricity bills are made up of several components. The supply charge pays for the actual power delivered to a customer. Distribution and transmission charges cover the cost of the wires, poles, and other infrastructure needed to deliver that power. Utilities often collect additional fees to fund energy efficiency programs, renewable energy initiatives, assistance for low-income customers, and other work.\nWhile this last segment of the bill has gotten the most attention lately, the other two make up the majority of the monthly cost. In Maine, for example, electricity supply currently accounts for 3951\nLowering \u2014 or even stabilizing \u2014 supply and delivery costs can be tricky. But it is precisely the renewable energy and energy efficiency programs being targeted for cuts that can help control those costs, because they lessen the need for expensive grid upgrades and shelter ratepayers from volatile natural gas prices, advocates say.\nUtility infrastructure is built to handle far more power than is needed on most days; the systems are scaled to be able to meet the demand of millions of air conditioners running on the hottest days of the year. So lowering the power needed at those peak moments \u2014 through energy-efficient heat pumps or rooftop solar panels that generate power right where it\u2019s needed \u2014 can reduce the cost of keeping the infrastructure up to the challenge.\n\u201c\u201c\nEnergy efficiency and renewable energy progress can also mean cheaper power supply. Electricity supply in New England is so expensive in large part because of the region\u2019s dependence on power plants that run on natural gas, a fuel that is prone to price volatility and which is forecast to get more expensive in coming years. Energy efficiency improvements lower electricity demand, reducing the impact these price fluctuations have on consumers. And replacing this power with renewable energy that gets free fuel from the sun and wind can also reduce and stabilize electric bills.\nCutting support for renewables and efficiency may seem to save money, but the costs just crop up again elsewhere, said Greg Cunningham, vice president of clean energy and climate change for the Conservation Law Foundation.\n\u201c\n## How to lower energy bills in the Northeast\nContaining costs for supply, distribution, and transmission is challenging but doable and necessary, advocates say.\nThough Massachusetts\u2019 cuts to energy efficiency programming disappointed consumer and environmental groups, many praised a plan Gov. Maura Healey announced this month to save residents $58\nBoston Mayor Michelle Wu this week announced plans to tackle the city\u2019s high energy costs by installing 500010000150300\nConnecticut legislators are considering proposals to make appliance energy standards more stringent and to allow cities and towns to aggregate their energy demand, negotiate for lower supply prices, and potentially use the savings to develop their own renewable power projects.\nAdvocates have also suggested that states adopt a performance-based ratemaking structure, in which utilities make money not just for building and repairing infrastructure but for reaching specific goals, such as equity, emissions reductions, or cost control. Several noted that states could also lower the rate of return utilities are allowed to earn on their infrastructure investments.\nClean energy advocates accept that some programs might need to change. Massachusetts, for example, could reconsider the value of some years-old initiatives paid for by ratepayers, Chretien said. In Maine, it makes more sense to review the solar-incentive program known as net energy billing for possible cost-saving tweaks than to completely repeal it, Cunningham said.\nWhat\u2019s important, advocates say, is that policymakers avoid scapegoating energy efficiency and renewable energy, and start the hard work of solving the real problems.\n\u201c\u201c\n* Utilities\n* Clean energy\n* Policy & regulation\n* Northeast\nSarah Shemkus is a reporter at Canary Media who is based in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and covers New England.\nHide Comments\nLock Thread\nLogin\nAdd CommentM \u2193\nUpvotesNewestOldest\nD\nDwight Johnson\n0 points\n7 months ago\nHi Sarah, Very informative, Well written\n![](\nGreg Ballantyne\n0 points\n7 months ago\nCutting the most inexpensive and efficient source of power known to mankind with the expectation of bringing down costs?

Michael Jones via Getty Images)\nAfter a decade of urging from clean energy advocates, utility Duke Energy finally has a plan to let its North Carolina customers access detailed information about their electricity use.\nApproved by state regulators on July 16\nThe Duke plan is a step toward solving a common problem for utility customers, large and small: They don\u2019t have ready access to complete, granular information about their energy use or an easy way to share that data with others. That can complicate decarbonization efforts for a range of consumers, from households that want rooftop solar to cities aiming to shrink their carbon footprints.\nThe city of Charlotte, for instance, owns one of the world\u2019s busiest airports, which it aims to power entirely with clean energy by the end of the decade. But dozens of private entities within the facility have electricity accounts, so city officials don\u2019t know exactly how much power the entire complex uses \u2014 or how much renewable energy they need to meet their target.\nAt the other end of the size spectrum, individuals considering energy-efficiency improvements, rooftop solar panels, or switching to a heat pump often don\u2019t have a full picture of when their energy use peaks or which appliances gobble up the most power.\nLimited access to energy-usage data is hardly confined to Duke, said Michael Murray, who cofounded the nonprofit Mission:data after realizing that\n\u201c201310\u201c41\u201c\nLike North Carolina-based advocates, Mission:data has been cajoling Duke for better data access for years. And though the group declined to endorse the proposal put forward in November by the utility, in-state advocates, and others, Murray doesn\u2019t question the rationale of those who backed it.\n\u201c\nThat\u2019s especially welcome under the Trump administration, which has created countless new barriers to adopting clean energy. With the November proposal now blessed by regulators, communities and individuals alike are better equipped to take advantage of what federal climate programs still exist \u2014 and to decarbonize in general.\n\u201c\nFor example, North Carolina\u2019s federally funded $156\n\u201c\u201c\nIndividual customers contemplating solar or high-efficiency appliances like heat pumps can still access a 30the end of this year.\nAggregate data that shows the combined energy use of multiple utility customers can help cities like Charlotte administer a\n\u201c\u201c\nGranular details about energy use at 15time-of-use rates and virtual power plants. Virtual power plants are networks of rooftop solar, home batteries, and other distributed energy resources that utilities can manipulate to support grid reliability at large, while time-of-use rates are electricity charges that vary over the course of the day to nudge energy use to periods of low demand.\n\u201c\nBut certain features of the new data access program remain unsettled, and the devil could be in those details, says Murray.\nCustomers can receive two years of their own individual data for free. But Murray worries that regulators will allow Duke to charge exorbitant access fees for aggregated data or to third parties, which would undercut the program.\n\u201c\u2018\u201c3100200\nIn the latter case, third parties would be more likely to resort to \u201c\nWhat\u2019s more, Murray said, \u201c\u2018\nTime is of the essence.

Kowalski\n18 September 2025\n* *\n!Aerial shot of large industrial facility\nCleveland Works currently relies on two blast furnaces, which use coal to refine iron ore that is later processed into steel. (The Center For Land Use Interpretation;\nCleveland has big ambitions to reduce its planet-warming emissions. But a massive steelmaking facility run by Cleveland-Cliffs, one of Ohio\u2019s major employers, could make it difficult for the city to see those plans through.\nThe plant emits roughly 422050\nCleveland\u2019s \u201c\u201c\nAs a major investment decision looms over an aging blast furnace at the facility, it\u2019s unclear whether the company will move to cut its direct greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 or opt to reinvest in its existing coal-dependent processes.\nCliffs\u2019 progress in reducing its nationwide emissions earned it recognition as a 2023 in the Department of Energy\u2019s Better Climate Challenge. As this year began, the company was set to slash emissions even further through projects supported by Biden-era legislation \u2014 the Inflation Reduction Act and the 2021\nThen the Trump administration commenced its monthslong campaign of reneging on funding commitments for clean energy projects, including ones meant to ramp up the production of \u201cCEOMiddletown Works in southwestern Ohio to produce green steel, saying there wouldn\u2019t be a sufficient supply of hydrogen for the plant.\nTo Lewis, coauthor of the Industrious Labs report, that\u2019s a weak excuse, because hydrogen production by other companies would have ramped up to supply the facility. \u201c[Cliffs was] going to need so much hydrogen that they would be creating the demand,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, Cliffs\u2019 Cleveland Works continues to spew emissions that drive climate change and harm human health. Industrious Labs\u2019 modeling estimates that pollution from Cleveland Works is responsible for up to 3917009000\n## A road map for cutting carbon\nCleveland Works\u2019 Blast Furnace #6\nTo Industrious Labs, this presents an opportunity: The company could replace the old infrastructure with equipment that can process iron ore with natural gas or hydrogen instead of coal. Investing in this technology, called direct reduction, would cut the plant\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions by more than 30\nThe alternative is to just reline the furnace, which was the course Cliffs chose for the Cleveland facility\u2019s Blast Furnace #52022\nRelining might provide small emissions cuts when measured per ton of steel, due to increased efficiencies, Lewis said. But ramped-up production from running more ore through the furnace could offset those reductions or even increase total emissions.\nCliffs did not respond to Canary Media\u2019s repeated requests for comment for this story, and it has not yet publicly announced its plans for Blast Furnace #6\nTo put itself on track with Cleveland\u2019s emissions goals, however, the company would need to do more than just convert Blast Furnace #6\nThe next step in the road map the group laid out would be for Cliffs to process refined iron ore into steel with an electric arc furnace \u2014 which can run on carbon-free power \u2014 instead of using the current basic oxygen equipment. Investing in green-hydrogen-based direct reduction and an electric arc furnace, instead of relining Blast Furnace #647\nLater steps would use direct reduction of iron and an electric arc furnace to refine and process the ore that is currently handled by Blast Furnace #596\n## What happens now?\nThe Industrious Labs analysis appears to lay out a credible decarbonization pathway, although not necessarily the only one, said Jenita McGowan, Cuyahoga County\u2019s deputy chief of sustainability and climate. Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, also has a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050\n\u201c\nFor now, the city and county seem to be taking a pragmatic approach, focusing on achievements to date and encouraging future cuts wherever companies will make them.\nBut getting to net-zero for the industrial sector \u201c40\u201c\nCuyahoga County\u2019s draft climate plan highlights Cliffs\u2019 energy-efficiency improvements, including Cleveland Works\u2019 use of some iron from the firm\u2019s direct reduction plant in Toledo, Ohio. Cleveland Works also leverages much of the waste heat from its industrial activities to make electricity. The facility recently boosted that combined-heat-and-power generation by about 50\nFaster emissions reductions are certainly better, McGowan said. But the county also wants to make sure companies can stay in business as they decarbonize \u2014 especially Cliffs, one of the largest sources of commerce at the city\u2019s port.\nIn Lewis\u2019 view, decarbonizing Cleveland Works earlier rather than later would be a smart business move for Cliffs. \u201c\nOne of Cliffs\u2019 largest markets is supplying high-quality steel for automobiles, including electric vehicles, she added. In March, Hyundai announced plans to invest $6produce low-carbon steel. As automakers face global pressure to source cleaner metal, Cliffs could find itself left behind, Lewis suggested.\nThe Industrious Labs report \u201c\u201c\n* Green steel\n* Emissions reduction\n* Fossil fuels\n* Midwest\n* Ohio\nKathiann M.

(Axel Heimken\/picture alliance via Getty Images)\nThis summer,\nEfforts like these are playing out worldwide as the maritime industry works to replace dirty diesel fuel in oceangoing ships, which haul everything from T-shirts and tropical fruit to solar panels, smartphones, and steel rebar. But the progress to date has been piecemeal, representing only a sliver of the world\u2019s oil-guzzling freighters and tankers.\nUp until last week, the United Nations\u2019 International Maritime Organization appeared on the cusp of approving a strategy to supercharge shipping decarbonization worldwide.

(Mohssen Assanimoghaddam\/picture alliance via Getty Images)\nCurrent adoption of those fuels amounts to a tiny droplet in an ocean\u2019s worth of oil. Much of it is driven by voluntary efforts by companies like Maersk, which face pressure from investors and customers to clean up their fleets. Meanwhile, regional environmental policies are taking effect. European nations and China are working to rein in ship-engine pollution, and they and other countries \u2014 including Brazil, India, and, until recently, the United States \u2014 are steering government funding into hydrogen production.\nHydrogen is a key component of ammonia and methanol \u2014 two common chemicals that can be used in engines or fuel cells. How clean those fuels actually are depends largely on whether the hydrogen is produced using renewables, or the way that most H2 is made today: with fossil fuels. Renewable diesel, another lower-carbon option for powering vessels, also uses hydrogen in its production process.\nIf every project to produce green ammonia, green methanol, and renewable diesel comes online as planned, and if the fuels only go toward powering ships \u2014 not airplanes or vehicles or to other uses \u2014 they would make up less than 202030290\nThose are two enormous \u201cIMO\nLast year, Danish energy giant \u00d8rsted revoked an award of up to $99sweeping cuts to the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.

Sen. Martin Heinrich, Democrat from New Mexico, says the decision is illegal.\nIn an exclusive new interview with Canary Media, Heinrich discusses why he\u2019s demanding that the Department of Energy account for the decision \u2014 and what response he\u2019s received.\nLast month, Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, DOE\n\u201cDOE\u201c\nThat trust is eroding rapidly, Heinrich said.

And that\u2019s what we had here.\nThe reality is, we need this administration to follow the law and make good on commitments that have been made so that there is predictability in the market. We also need every cheap electron we can get right now, and so if you put these big infrastructure projects in jeopardy, what you\u2019re really doing is passing along more costs to consumers.\nHave you received any response from DOE\nNot yet.\nDo you expect you\u2019ll eventually get a response?\nI certainly expect to. And if the secretary wants to be taken seriously by the Senate, then he needs to provide that information.\nOne of the things that really bothers me about a lot of the actions that the Department of Energy and the Department of Interior are taking right now is the sum total is creating a lot of uncertainty in the finance markets, and that flows through to create additional costs for consumers.\nWhen you have a big transmission project like this one, there are $52\nYou asked the department if it had analyzed the impact of canceling the loan guarantee. What do you see as the administration\u2019s responsibility in analyzing its actions on energy policy in terms of affordability? And are they fulfilling those responsibilities?\nThey are not. And it doesn\u2019t take a detailed analysis to understand that, in an environment of surging demand, if you artificially constrain supply, you\u2019re going to be raising costs for people. And I want the American people to know that this is not an accident. They are choosing to take actions which are raising people\u2019s electric bills.\nSen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican representing Iowa, has said he until there\u2019s some response from the administration regarding its actions on wind and solar tax credits. Can you tell us more about where members of Congress have power to challenge how the administration is managing energy policy?\nWell, I think the confirmation process is one obvious place. This is an administration that has been very public about saying that they need more people in place to be able to execute their agenda. But unless they\u2019re responsive to the Congress, that process is not going to speed up.\nYou asked the DOEclosed loans and conditional commitments that the department is reviewing.

Ten pro-renewables siting laws passed versus seven that are expected to restrict clean energy.\nStill, the flood of new anti-renewables legislation underscores the increasingly hostile policy environment for clean energy.\nAlready, 1645944\nSuch policies are becoming more common around the U.S., the Sabin Center finds, a fact that is not surprising given shrinking public approval for large clean energy projects. Support for expanding solar farms fell from 66522022\nStill, some Democrat-led states are boosting policy support for clean energy deployment \u2014 most notably Colorado. Even in deep-red Ohio, the governor signed into law a bipartisan, tech-neutral bill that is expected to make it modestly easier to build clean energy.\nStates and municipalities have significant power to advance clean energy, even without the federal government. They also have the ability to stifle it, making state and local government a crucial arena for the energy transition.

Chemical plants consume lots of fossil fuels, both to power the high-temperature, high-pressure processes involved and often as a feedstock for the chemicals produced. And to maximize production, those plants are typically built to be as large as possible.\nTodd Brix, CEO\n\u201c\nLast week, the company\u2019s pilot plant in Richland, Washington, started producing a class of chemicals known as formates, used in everything from deicing airplanes to preserving animal feed.

But OCOchem\u2019s electrolytic cells aren\u2019t taking on anything as dangerous as nuclear fission.

Now, it\u2019s got a road map to realize them.\nLast week, the California Heat Pump Partnership announced the nation\u2019s first critical tech for decarbonizing buildings and improving public health. The plan draws on recommendations from the public-private partnership\u2019s members, which include government agencies, heat pump manufacturers, retailers, utilities, and other stakeholders.\n\u201c\nIn 20226203019\nThe state is not on track to hit that 20302\nHeat pump units are outselling gas furnaces nationally, but of the roughly 1HVAC80000035heat pump models.

Many Californians aren\u2019t aware of the appliance\u2019s benefits, according to the report. Heat pumps are typically more expensive up front than gas furnaces and can cost more to run in states like California where electricity prices are high relative to those of gas. Plus, many contractors aren\u2019t prioritizing heat pumps, citing a lack of market confidence, the report notes.\nThe blueprint lays out a raft of solutions to make heat pumps more desirable and affordable. Building customer demand and contractor support is key to making them \u201c\nTo create buzz for the appliances, the partnership is launching a \u201c\nTo reduce up-front costs, the coalition supports expanding heat pump financing tools, like the low-interest loans from the \u201c\nApplying lessons from existing incentive initiatives like abruptly run out.\n\u201c\u201c\nThe group also endorses streamlining the permitting process for heat pump installations, a measure\nThe blueprint points out that focusing on particular markets could help supercharge heat pump adoption.

But exactly how much will be up for debate, Weeks said. Funds could come from a variety of sources, including cap-and-trade revenues, utility ratepayer programs, and state tax dollars, she said. The report recommends minimizing the use of ratepayer funding; California is looking to cut costs to utility customers as the state\u2019s electricity bills skyrocket.\nLast Monday, California 290$88 for heat pumps and other home energy upgrades, because state officials couldn\u2019t access funds.\nBut Weeks remains sanguine; California runs several home-grown programs, including the\n\u201c\u201c\n* Heat pumps\n* Carbon-free buildings\n* Electrification\n* Emissions reduction\n* West\n* California\nAlison F.

But the underlying recipe remains virtually the same: Combine sand, sodium carbonate, and limestone, then blast the ingredients with scorching heat in a kiln or furnace.\nToday, the vast majority of that heat is supplied by burning fossil fuels. Whether manufacturers are turning glass into windows, beverage bottles, smartphone screens, or coatings for solar panels, their methods require lots of energy to reach superhigh temperatures and, as a result, can be very carbon-intensive.\nGlobal glassmakers in recent years\nThe latest of these emerging efforts comes from Bavaria, Germany, where the multinational firm Schott\nSchott says its electric tank could slash greenhouse gas emissions from the melting process alone by 8040472027\nJonas Spitra, Schott\u2019s head of sustainability communications, said that replacing fossil fuels with electrified technology \u2014 while still meeting strict quality requirements for specialty glass \u2014 marks \u201c\nSchott, which operates in over 30\u201c\n!Close up of rack of small tubes Schott's borosilicate glass products for pharmaceutical containers on display at a 2020 exhibition in Shanghai (Xinhua\/Zhao Dingzhe via Getty Images)\nThe German pilot project is moving forward just as a few ambitious low-carbon glass initiatives in the United States have fallen into limbo. In May, the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Energy canceled awards worth roughly $177\n\u201cDOE\u201c\n## Getting hot enough to melt glass\nWorldwide, manufacturers made more than 1502022420232\nStill, glassmaking remains a significant source of planet-warming gases and local air pollutants like nitrogen oxides. And the challenge of slashing those emissions is essentially the same one vexing other heavy industries: figuring out how to reach hot enough temperatures to make materials without cooking the planet in the process.\nChemical producers are pilot-testing their own electric furnaces to make important compounds like ethylene, which is the building block of many plastic products. Cement startups are developing electricity-driven processes and thermal storage systems to replace traditional kilns. Global steelmakers, meanwhile, are investing in technologies that sidestep the need to use coal, such as hydrogen-based ironmaking facilities and electric arc furnaces.\nFor glass, the biggest hurdle to decarbonization lies in the melting process, Schott\u2019s Spitra explained.\n![]( Schott researchers conduct tests on a lab-scale electric melting tank for pharmaceutical glass in Germany. (Schott)\nGlass furnaces require temperatures of between 1200170021923092CO2 comes from burning fossil fuels, though some emissions result from the chemical reactions that happen when heating up sodium carbonate (soda ash) and limestone.\nIn a conventional furnace, gas is injected into a combustion chamber to melt the ingredients into a glowing orange liquid. In an electric version, electrodes pass currents through a conductor to generate heat. Today, the industry mostly uses electric equipment only for smaller-scale furnaces or to supplement the fossil-fuel-based heat inside larger furnaces \u2014 a step known as \u201c\nFacilities that make high-volume products like container glass and windows are trickier to fully electrify. Existing electric designs have struggled to operate with the same consistency and flexibility as gas furnaces, and they can\u2019t incorporate as much recycled material into the glass mix. Electric furnaces also tend to wear down and need replacing about twice as fast as their gas-burning counterparts, according to glass industry experts.\nIn Germany, Schott is aiming to address those problems with its new industrial-scale melting tank, which must also meet the exacting standards for bubble-free, high-quality pharmaceutical glass. The initiative, which Schott began developing in 2021\n![]( An illustration of Schott's electric melting tank, being built in the German town of Mitterteich (Schott)\nThe company is investing in electrification in part to meet European climate regulations, including a \u201c\n## An uncertain path to decarbonization\nBeyond the technical issues, a few other barriers stand in the way of electrifying glassmaking at a wider scale.\nIn some locations, the local grid may be unable to support a major increase in electricity use, requiring companies and utilities to upgrade that infrastructure or build more wind, solar, and other electricity resources. For producers of mass-market packaging like soda bottles, it can be harder to convince beverage companies to pay more for low-carbon glass if it means raising the sticker price of the final product, especially if the competition is cheap plastic containers.\nAnother challenge for U.S. glassmakers in particular is that switching to electricity very likely means paying higher utility bills, making it harder to justify ditching fossil gas.\nSonya Pump, the global sustainability director for Ohio-based O-I Glass, said that gas pricing is one of the key factors the company weighs when evaluating low-carbon furnace technologies \u2014 along with potential technical constraints or risks to its manufacturing capabilities.

The most prevalent approach to date \u2014 and the one that\u2019s gotten billions of dollars of investment \u2014 is direct reduction of iron via hydrogen.\nDirect reduced iron is being deployed by the biggest green-steel projects in the world, such as the H2 and Hybrit plants in Sweden. But early-stage efforts to build up capacity for hydrogen direct reduced iron in the U.S. have faltered in the face of high costs, lack of commitments from buyers, and more recently, the Trump administration\u2019s U-turn on Biden-era policies supporting industrial decarbonization. The process also requires cost-effective production of carbon-free hydrogen, a challenging prospect in and of itself.\nelectricity to heat iron ore to blast-furnace temperatures. The startup plans to open its\nElectra\u2019s approach,\nElectra\u2019s quest to purify iron via electrowinning has faced some key challenges. For example, the company had to figure out how to accelerate the dissolution of iron ore in the solution and how to maintain the purity of the ions collected through the electrowinning process, Quoc Pham, the company\u2019s cofounder and chief technology officer, told Canary Media in 2023\nElectra has produced plates of pure iron in pilot tests. That\u2019s just the first of many steps in proving it can cost-effectively scale up the technology to operate in high-throughput industrial settings using iron ores with a wide mix of chemical compositions, Nijhawan said.\nBut success on those fronts could unlock a lot of opportunities for Electra investors along the iron and steel value chain, he said \u2014 starting with the company\u2019s longest-running strategic investor and top U.S. steelmaker Nucor.\nNucor exclusively uses electric arc furnaces, which require careful calibration of the mix of scrap steel and purified iron going into them to produce different grades of steel for diverse industrial sectors.\nThose include the automotive manufacturing market, where multi-billion-dollar investments in the electric equipment.\n\u201c\u201c\nElectra\u2019s technology can also purify a wide range of iron ores, which could open up new markets for iron-mining giants like those investing in the startup\u2019s latest round, Nijhawan noted.

While the CPUC in 2021 had ordered the state's utilities and other load serving entities to procure over 15 gigawatts of new reliability resources such as large-scale batteries, the Governor and key legislators were concerned that there would not be enough new batteries to go around because of supply chain disruptions. The DSGS program was part of a larger legislative package called the Strategic Reliability Reserve. The biggest element of that package was to pay the owners of 50+ year old coastal power plants in Southern California $1.2 billion from 2024 through 2026 to keep the plants on stand-by. However, because California successfully added one 10 GW of new batteries since 2022 there has been no need to use these slow-starting thermal power plants in the summers of 2024 and 2025. The DSGS program could be funded in 2026 with the remaining funds from the Strategic Reliability Reserve if the Governor and the Department of Water Resources would terminate the contracts for the unneeded capacity from the old power plants.\n![](\nG E\n0 points\n28 days ago\nAs a large employer we had participated in these programs in the past however California's new labor laws regarding canceled shifts make it more expensive for us to participate than the benefit we receive from these programs.\n![](\nJerry Wagner\n0 points\n29 days ago\n2026 will be the spring-board year for V2G, V2H and V2-BESS in California.

Utilities there must invest heavily in wildfire-prevention measures, and the state\u2019s ambitious decarbonization goals mean the power system needs to support the rapid electrification of homes and vehicles.\nIf California can defer upgrades to its distribution system, it can produce savings for customers, O\u2019Connell said.\n\u201c\u201c\nAnd according to GridLab\u2019s new study, the best way to defer the most upgrades is to find those grid sweet spots \u2014 specifically, the areas with circuits, transformers, and substations that are least\nKevala, the startup that partnered with GridLab on the study, has a decent idea of where those sweet spots might be, based on its past analyses of distribution grids in California and\nThe new study looks at the ideal way to deploy the 35\u201c\nFor the research, Kevala compiled data on every feeder line, substation transformer, and substation of California\u2019s three biggest utilities from today through 203035GWVPP\nThat last technique was by far the most cost-effective, the analysis showed. Putting it into practice could reduce grid costs passed on to utility customers by a total of $137203010\nThe reason? Taking on the least overloaded circuits first allows the same amount of load flexibility to defer new investments across a wider swath of the low-voltage grid, O\u2019Connell said. The strategy also happens to target more urban areas, where much of the grid is buried underground, making it more expensive and difficult to upgrade.\n## Reversing the status-quo approach for \u200b\u201c\nThat result came as something of a surprise.\n\u201c\u201c\u201c\nVPPs may also struggle to meet the challenge of deferring investments in the most strained parts of the grid, he noted. The history of these efforts appears to bear that out.\nFor more than a decade, utilities and regulators have been working on so-called \u201c2014\u201c\nBut beyond some showcase projects like New York utility Con Edison\u2019s \u201c\nOn the other hand, \u201c\u201c\nTargeting the least overloaded circuits could also minimize the risk of VPPs falling short of the job, he said. Slightly overloaded transformers and power lines can undergo overload conditions for short periods of time without blowing up or breaking down.\nLarger-scale non-wires alternative projects like those that have been targeted in the past have a slimmer margin of error, he said. Utilities have traditionally demanded that any DERs being deployed to solve those grid constraints be made available for that purpose to the exclusion of any other use.\nThat\u2019s a tough sell for customers of the companies putting VPPs together. Most consumers buy batteries for emergency backup power or to store surplus solar power \u2014 not to turn them over completely to utility control.\nCustomers willing to enroll their EVVPP\u201cEV\nWith less-overloaded parts of the grid, by contrast, \u201c\u201c\u2018\n## Building load flexibility into grid plans\nThere\u2019s a big catch when it comes to putting insights like these into action, however, said Kevala CEO\nThat\u2019s the safer tried-and-true choice \u2014 and utilities, with their \u201c\u201c\nIt\u2019s taken years for California utilities to start using the inherent flexibility of these technologies to help with grid operation and planning. But now, after some experimentation, they\u2019re starting to prove that EV, distributed solar installations, and\nStill, VPPDER\u201c\nEven getting the grid data needed for VPPkilled a bill provision that would have required California\u2019s three major utilities to share data to inform how VPPs can reduce grid costs.\nBut Shumavon thinks that utilities in California are coming around to the need to move faster.

They receive more profit by doing something poorly (more infrastructure \/ cost) then do something well (efficient deployment of infrastructure). This is easily fixed should the regulatory bodies do their jobs well. But most don't, they focus on the politics, instead of meeting customer needs. And of course, one of the key's is overbuilding so there are never shortages. But with batteries as a flexible backup, the overbuilding is no longer necessary as it was in the past. But there's no profit in running efficiently and paying millions of service providers who also are your customers.\nD\nDwight L Johnson\n0 points\n47 days ago\n\"Utilities have traditionally demanded that any DERs being deployed to solve those grid constraints be made for that purpose to the exclusion of any other use.\" Not only is that demand untenable to many of us owners of RTS, but another huge problem is the prices owners of RTS receive from PG&E. For example, under NEM 3 PG&E pays owners of RTS $.05 per KWH for extra electrons and and sells those electrons to a neighbor next door or across the street for $.45 per KWH. RTS owners are at the mercy of PG&E and the sycophant PUC regarding pricing. Owners would have no leverage.\n![](\nJerry Wagner\n0 points\n47 days ago\nUtility monopolies, wealthy AI developers, cheap watt sucking CryptoPunks who got kicked out of China in 2022, and VPPs are not going to solve this.\nIf cities & towns want to accelerate their local energy transition to benefit all their ordinary rate payers, they just need to mandate solar parking lot canopy microgrids at ALL the existing, widely distributed, large, hot, asphalt parking lots within their jurisdiction, within 5 years. Solar canopies +non-flammable BESS +Vehicle-2-BESS chargers, right where most rate payers live, work & commute from large apartments, condos & single-family neighborhoods to shopping centers, business parks & various municipal facilities, like hospitals & community colleges.\nNo new utility monopoly transmission, site acquisition, or other site improvement spending required. And no permitting & interconnection delays or armies of litigious NIMBYS. And remember, all those big hot asphalt parking lots in your town were mandated by local government. All perfectly legal.\nFor a commercial solar canopy micro grid system costing $1 million, a 30% Federal Investment Tax Credit, MACRS accelerated depreciation, and an SGIP battery rebate reduce the net cost to about $470k, resulting in a payback period of less than 4 years. Even without subsidies, the payback is less than 8 years. The benefits are so obvious that all the new healthcare facilities in my county have already shaded 80% of their big parking lots with solar canopies.
