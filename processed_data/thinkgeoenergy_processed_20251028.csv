German Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) visited the geothermal power and lithium extraction facility of
Landau is the site of Vulcan’s upstream Lithium Extraction Optimization Plant (LEOP), where lithium chloride (LiCl) is extracted from geothermal brines. This facility was officially opened in November 2023. Lithium chloride from Landau is then sent to Vulcan’s Central Lithium Electrolysis Optimisation Plant (CLEOP) in Frankfurt-Höchst, where it is converted to lithium hydroxide.
During his visit, Scholz reiterated the importance of geothermal for the future energy needs of Germany, describing it as a “largely unused but very ecological option to ensure that we provide the heat needed for households and businesses in Germany.” Geretsried and Potsdam.

Scholz also emphasized the need for a secure domestic lithium value chain in Germany and Europe and reaffirmed his government’s commitment to support the expansion of geothermal energy, targeting 100 new geothermal projects by 2030.
“The idea that we have to import lithium from many countries far away from us keeps cropping up, and we are dependent on those who sell it to us. In fact, in Europe, but especially in Germany, we have the foundations to be able to produce this raw material supply ourselves. In addition, we have a great deal of untapped potential for a sustainable heat supply, such as deep geothermal energy, which could supply both households and industry with renewable energy. This technology is trendsetting. As the German government, we actively support this innovative approach,”
“Vulcan’s mission is to deliver domestic and sustainable lithium to support Europe’s green energy and mobility transition. The Chancellor’s visit reaffirms the importance of our Lionheart Project as the most advanced integrated lithium and renewable energy project in Europe and gives us additional confidence that our work aligns with key policy priorities,”

The CarbonCuts Project is a high-profile initiative aimed at identifying optimal onshore subsurface storage solutions for CO2 sequestration. With geological CO2 storage now a globally recognised, proven, and safe technology to tackle the climate crisis, and CO2 storage on land being significantly more affordable than offshore options, onshore CO2 storage is becoming increasingly accessible for a wider range of emitters to manage their emissions responsibly.
S3, a leading geophysical service provider, is at the forefront of this initiative, spearheading the acquisition of a high-density seismic dataset using STRYDE’s innovative nodal seismic acquisition system.
_“_ The CarbonCuts Project is a cornerstone in Denmark’s journey toward a greener future, and we are proud to contribute. The Rødby structure, an elongated anticlinal dome with a four-way closure that formed during the Mesozoic Era over a Zechstein salt pillow, is a fascinating target for this high-density seismic survey,”3
_“STRYDE’s cutting-edge technology is pivotal to delivering superior seismic image quality. The dense deployment of STRYDE nodes provides exceptional clarity of the subsurface, enabling stakeholders to identify geological structures suitable for carbon storage with greater precision. This significantly reduces risks and enhances the reliability of long-term CO? sequestration solutions.”_
The seismic survey will be crucial in advancing Denmark’s ambitious goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2045, utilising advanced seismic technology to map geological formations with unprecedented accuracy, ultimately helping to ensure safe and effective onshore CO2 storage.
Mike Popham, CEO of STRYDE, commented: “This collaboration highlights how our unique seismic system is revolutionising the industry, enabling the rapid and safe acquisition of the seismic data needed to empower organisations to make more informed decisions, driving meaningful climate action.
_“Our solution significantly lowers the barriers for onshore carbon storage initiatives, and we are proud to help S 3 deliver seismic data needed for this important project. Together, these organisations are paving the way for more sustainable energy practices and helping to secure a cleaner, greener future.”_

An independent panel has granted resource consent to construct and operate a power station near the Taheke geothermal field in Rotorua, New Zealand. The consent was granted to ROOPU Whakarite Mahi Limited Partnership, a partnership between
The project was deemed qualified for the fast-track consenting program under the COVID-19 Recovery Fast Track Consenting provisions. Thus, the decision has come 172 working days after the application was initially filed with the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA).
The Taheke project site straddles the Bay of Plenty Region and the Rotorua Lakes Districts, and is characterized by a geothermal area with a large system of springs, fumaroles, and sulfur deposits. The Taheke Geothermal Feild is located to the west of the proposed Power Station.
An exploration well had already been successfully drilled for the project in late 2021 and benefited from the Government’s COVID-19 recovery fund to support shovel-ready projects. Well testing was then conducted in mid-2022 and the results and data enabled the project to move to the consenting phase and make the application for fast-track consenting to the Ministry for the Environment.
The proposed timeline of the project estimates that construction will start by late 2024 to mid-2025 and will take approximately 24 months. The target date of commercial operations will be on 2028.
![]( masterplan for the Taheke Geothermal Project (source: EPA)
Based on the application submitted by ROOPU Whakarite Mahi, the power station to be built will have a capacity of 25 to 40 MWe. It will generate electricity using approximately 10,000 tonnes of geothermal fluid per day from the Taheke Geothermal Field. Four wells (two production and two reinjection) are initially expected to be needed and six additional wells will be drilled over the plant’s life.

The Scottish Government’s Sustainable Estates team will be funding a £50,000 feasibility study, to be conducted by
The desktop study is looking at whether local sites could provide a viable spot for one or more boreholes to harness naturally occurring sustainable energy from the rock thousands of metres underground. It could work in a similar way to the delivers heat to one of the world’s largest indoor rainforests. Geothermal energy has the potential to support not only health care facilities in Aberdeen but other public buildings too.
“It’s estimated there’s enough untapped deep geothermal energy to heat the whole of the UK, and we’re hoping to provide a leading example here in Aberdeen,”
“This study is the very first step in what would be a long journey, but it could help us make progress towards becoming a Net Zero organisation. We’re very pleased to be working alongside TownRock Energy on this, and we are working to change the way we use NHS buildings and land more widely. Curbing emissions and supporting biodiversity ultimately supports public health by delivering less pollution, cleaner air, and cleaner water.”
TownRock Energy CEO David Townsend added: The sites we’re exploring have been identified as potentially having the right geology for deep geothermal heat and power. This feasibility study is enabling us to look at that in more depth and build a business case with NHS Grampian for wider development. We’re considering whether the geothermal wells would have to go 2 km, 3 km or 5 km down.”
“When people hear the word geothermal, they often think about active volcanic and tectonic areas, like Iceland or Italy, where hot rocks have been producing power for over a hundred years. But recent advances in engineering mean that lower temperature resources in geologically stable regions are now usable. It’s hoped that this could be the case for Aberdeen.”

The geothermal energy sector, highlighting issues arising from the Renewable Energy Support Mechanism (YEKDEM) schedule, is requesting an extension of the incentive period until 2040. Ali Kindap, Chairman of the Board of the
Kindap recalled that, according to Presidential Decree No. 7189 published in the Official Gazette on May 1, 2023, electricity generation facilities with a Renewable Energy Certificate (YEK) that commence operations by December 31, 2030, will be eligible for YEKDEM. He pointed out that this regulation poses a major obstacle to geothermal investments.
“We request that the deadline for geothermal energy investments to benefit from YEKDEM be extended from 2030 to 2040,”
Geothermal has different dynamics from wind and solar
Kindap noted that geothermal energy has different dynamics compared to other renewable energy sources like wind and solar. He reminded that in the process known as the Third YEKDEM
“A geothermal investment process, which includes stages such as licensing, permits, site acquisition, environmental impact assessment (EIA), drilling, resource efficiency assessment, power plant construction, and commissioning, takes at least five years under the best circumstances. Many companies looking to invest today face the risk of not being able to complete their projects by 2030 due to existing regulations. This disrupts geothermal investments.”
By the end of 2025, 36% of installed geothermal capacity will be outside YEKDEM
Kindap stated that the sector has shared its concerns with the relevant public authorities and emphasized the need to balance power plants that have completed their YEKDEM periods with new investments. He also highlighted the key role of geothermal energy in Turkey’s 2053 Net Zero
This demand was previously raised by the help Turkey achieve its renewable energy targets.
Geothermal sector representatives stated that extending the period would both increase interest in the sector and be a critical step for Turkey’s energy security. They urged for the regulation to be implemented as soon as possible.

In the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ), supercritical conditions can be found at depths as shallow as 4 kilometers. This makes New Zealand one of the few places in the world where supercritical geothermal resources are both accessible and technically feasible.
Supercritical in this context refers to conditions where pure water exceeds 373 °C and 220 bars of pressure. The supercritical state can provide up to three times higher production enthalpy compared to conventional geothermal.
#### Economic viability of supercritical geothermal
GNS Science further engaged with
As part of the report, several energy development scenarios were models with each one accounting for research and regulatory development timelines and exploration costs. Based on the results, the massive electricity generation potential of supercritical geothermal can be achieved economically by 2037, and conservatively by 2049.
“The results are exciting, and we are looking forward to support the government and the private sector to realise this New Zealand Inc opportunity,”
“Superhot geothermal generation would be economic to build, even at costs that are double that of new conventional geothermal power plants,”“New Zealand’s world-best scientists and technologists hold the skills and knowledge, and GNS Science the important IP for taking superhot geothermal forward.”

The new EU-funded FindHeat
The FindHeat consortium is led by
* ETH Zurich
* Imperial College London
* Charles University Prague
* University of Cologne
* the Czech Geological Survey
* Reykjavik Energy (Orkuveitan)
* Electricite de Strasbourg
* Repsol
* Delft Inversion
* TRACS International Ltd.
FindHeat is largely funded by the European Union and receives additional funding from UK Research and Innovation, the Swiss National Foundation, and the TU Delft Excellence Foundation.
The FindHeat consortium will develop an agile toolkit to help reduce technical and economic barriers holding back investment and undermining public trust in geothermal energy. The focus of the toolkit will be a new exploration workflow for geothermal energy that combines innovative software solutions, low-cost geophysical and geological exploration techniques, tailored training, and public engagement.
The new toolkit will be validated across eight geologically diverse geothermal plays to demonstrate its economic and technical benefits when exploring and appraising geothermal resources. The FindHeat consortium directly involves end users from industry that will not only support the development of the toolkit but also apply and exploit it in their daily operations to ensure its technical and economic feasibility.
FindHeat includes comprehensive social science research to co-create new communication strategies that improve public engagement and help to earn public trust. By combining improved public support with reduced technical and economic risk, the FindHeat consortium will lead to a more efficient and sustainable exploitation of geothermal energy and therefore help to meet the European targets for geothermal energy.

Enerdrape has developed the technology for pre-fabricated geothermal panels that can turn underground structures, such as garages or tunnels, into renewable sources of thermal energy for heat and cooling without drilling. 145 of these panels have been installed in the car park of a residence located at the 11th Arrondissement of Paris to supply 72 housing units. Heat captured by the system will then be transmitted to a 25 kW heat pump.
The project is one of several planned under the partnership of Enerdrape and CIEC, announced earlier this year. The installation work began in October and lasted three months with a budget of EUR 100,000. Other similar installations are being considered by Paris Habitat.
The geothermal panel installation will generate about 70 MWh of heat each year, accounting for about 25% of the domestic hot water requirements of the homes, and avoiding the equivalent of 15 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year.

“This installation marks a key milestone in our mission to unlock the untapped geothermal potential of underground environments for a sustainable energy transition,”
“With the trust of Paris Habitat, committed to the decarbonization of the residential sector, and the key role of CIEC and ENGIE Solutions in the development and integration of innovative technologies, we demonstrate that bold and efficient solutions such as Enerdrape’s geothermal panels can sustainably transform the production and use of heat in urban areas. This collaboration reflects our shared ambition to contribute to more sustainable and resilient cities in the face of climate challenges.”
Emmanuelle Copin, Deputy General Manager in charge of proximity and quality of service at Paris Habitat, added: “Paris Habitat, as a social housing company, seeks to implement solutions that allow us to control our tenants’ energy costs and, on the other hand, to decarbonize our installations when technically possible. The project proposed by CIEC and ENERDRAPE for a first installation in France immediately interested us: the main advantage of this solution is to use geothermal energy without drilling on the land.”
“The proposed geothermal panels also create a less invasive construction site by being installed on the vertical walls of underground car parks while maintaining access to the spaces during the work. The expected gains in terms of energy savings and the ease of installation make this a solution to consider each time we study the hybridization of our gas boilers.”

Sandia National Laboratories has published a detailed report and compendium of PDC drill bit performance based on wells drilled at the Utah FORGE project.

“Analysis of Rig Parameter Data Using Drilling Process Modeling Constraints,”
* Volume 1: Summary of Utah FORGE Wells 16A(78)-32, 56-32, 78B-32, and 16B(78)-32 (
* Volume 3: Utah FORGE Well 56-32 (
* Volume 4: Utah FORGE Well 78B-32 (
* Volume 5: Utah FORGE Well 16B(78)-32 (
The analysis done by SNL on the drilling records from the FORGE project aim to provide some level of guidance on selection of the right drill bit for geothermal well drilling, based on location and depth, to reduce drilling costs.
“At the FORGE site, a number of wells were drilled to depths of approximately 10,000 feet, and they were largely drilled by polycrystalline diamond compact bits,David Raymond, a Sandia mechanical engineer and leader of the analysis. “This is one of the largest applications of diamond bits for geothermal drilling in their 40-year history. We produced a compendium of all the drill bits used and how they performed.”
The US DOE-funded Utah FORGE project is a dedicated underground field laboratory for developing, testing, and accelerating breakthroughs in Enhanced Geothermal Systems technologies to advance the uptake of geothermal resources around the world. Earlier this year, the FORGE team announced successful results from long-term circulation tests, indicating good connectivity across the stimulated geothermal reservoir.

The Sandia research team, led by Raymond and with mechanical engineer Melanie Schneider, analyzed drill rig data from the four wells drilled at the FORGE site, looking at the response data and post-operation photos of each polycrystalline diamond compact bit. Polycrystalline diamond compact bits have proven to be more cost effective than roller bits for oil and gas drilling. This compendium could help do the same for geothermal drilling.
#### Analysis for better bits
Four wells were drilled for injection, production, and monitoring at the FORGE site, primarily using polycrystalline diamond compact bits. These bits use the strength of lab-made diamonds in the form of disc-shaped cutters. Many of these cutters are embedded into the bit in a specific arrangement designed to best cut the rock. The industrial diamonds in these bits are tiny, grown in a lab for strength rather than aesthetics.
To evaluate drill bit performance, the Sandia team collected data on four key parameters — the force applied to the drill bit by the rig, the rotation speed set by operators, the drilling speed, and the power needed to achieve that speed — and inserted those numbers into a computer model. They used the algorithm to model the interaction between the drill bit and the rock, comparing that with the response of a single standardized diamond cutter.

Drilling costs were also considered by the team, analyzing the balance between drilling speed and distance drilled and how that plays into the cost per foot drilled by each bit. One of the leading costs in geothermal well drilling is the daily expense of renting a drill rig, Raymond said. However, Schneidier emphasized that this doesn’t mean drilling faster is always the most cost-effective solution. Depending on the depth already drilled and the time taken to get a fresh bit to the bottom of the well, a slower, steadier approach may be more cost effective, Raymond added.
“A big cost is truly how long it takes to get in and out of the hole when you’re at depth,”“A key take-away from our reporting is it’s not necessarily about going fast or with more force; it’s about trying to extend the bit’s life and getting the most out of each one. We’re already seeing a huge improvement in drilling performance throughout the course of the four wells at FORGE.”
#### A history of work on diamond bits
The history of diamond-based drill bits is closely intertwined with the Sandia National Laboratories. In the early 1980s, at the advent of synthetic diamond manufacturing, the US DOE sponsored research at the Sandia to develop diamond-based drill bits for drilling in geothermal systems.
Sandia researchers, led by David Glowka tested diamond cutters from various manufacturers in the lab, measuring the forces required to scratch rock depending on the cutting angle and other parameters. Data from these experiments were fed into a computer model that allowed for the simulation of forces on any drill bit design. This code was then publicly released and provided to drill bit companies to inform the design of cutters on their bits, which was instrumental in catalyzing the industry.
The oil and gas industry has since then widely adopted the use of diamond bits. However, there were challenges remaining in drilling in geothermal sites, such as the high temperature and hard rock causing the drill bits to wear out too quickly. Sandia has continues refining diamond bits for geothermal drilling over the years, doing computational modeling of specific vibrations in hard rocks, and participating in field tests to improve diamond bit usage in extremely hard rock.
Raymond hopes this compendium of bit performance at the FORGE site will help bit manufacturers in designing even better performing bits and assist geothermal well drillers in selecting the best bits for their conditions. Both should help reduce startup costs for steady, clean electricity-producing geothermal power plants.
“It’s been a long road getting to this point where polycrystalline diamond compact bits are a viable solution for geothermal drilling,”“It’s not intuitively obvious how you should place the cutters across the bit to balance speed and lifetime, but that is what our analysis has accomplished. There’s an incredible wealth of information here on what worked and what didn’t work on these synthetic diamond bits.”

An excellent educational video featuring the fun characters
The highly entertaining video highlights how Cornwall is helping to save the world through sustainable mining, innovation, and green energy. Cornwall has a long history in mining, enabling industrial growth of many countries around the world by supplying rocks and minerals. The miners of Cornwall also contributed globally by sharing their knowledge and expertise.
Cornwall is also blessed with geothermal energy and is the site of two major geothermal projects – the Eden Geothermal project and the United Downs Deep Geothermal Power (UDDGP) project. The UDDGP is notable for being the first deep geothermal power plant in the UK, and is expected to start commercial operations later this year. There was also mention of the geothermal brine in Cornwall being rich with lithium, which is another avenue for Cornwall to contribute to sustainability efforts.

A recently published study exhibits that subsurface permeability can develop beyond the brittle-ductile transition, allowing for fluid circulation and further highlighting the potential in superhot geothermal systems. The study “Permeability partitioning through the brittle-to-ductile transition and its implications for supercritical geothermal reservoirs” by Meyer et al
This guest article by
New laboratory data has been published to support the potential of superhot geothermal as a game-changer for renewable energy development and the replacement of a significant amount of fossil fuels for energy production. The data, reported in the journal
Such fractures are important because water passing through them can become supercritical, allowing them to penetrate fractures more easily and have 5 to 10 times higher density compared to sub-critical geothermal fluids. This is one of many factors that led to the description of superhot geothermal as the “holy grail” of geothermal resources, notably by the Clean Air Task Force in a report published on 2021.
The data also show that rock that fractures at superhot conditions can be ten times more permeable than rock that fractures at conditions closer to the Earth’s surface, and can also deform more readily. Those factors could make this geothermal resource “much more economic,” says Geoffrey Garrison, Vice President of Operations for
#### A Geological Debate
Until now, geologists had been divided as to whether this superdeep, superhot resource can be tapped. Rock under such high pressures and temperatures—more than 375o o
The current work, led by a team at the
“There are also lots of other data coming out of this work that will inform our approach to tapping the resource,”“how strong is the rock? How far do the fractures go? How many fractures can we create?”
“All of this will help us derisk the drilling involved, which is very expensive. You don’t get a lot of chances. You don’t get to drill a hole then, like hanging a picture, move it over if you’ve missed the best location.
#### “Exciting Finding”
Peter Massie is director of the Geothermal Energy Office at the Nature CommunicationsX
“Exciting finding: extreme heat & pressure can help create better enhanced geothermal systems [EGS]. At very high temps, rocks become ductile (plasticky), which was expected to impede EGS. This supports [the] prospect of ultradeep, ‘supercritical’ geothermal with major boost in output.”
The research was led by Associate Professor
“This work is exciting because it presents the first permeability measurements conducted during deformation at pressure and temperature conditions characteristic of deep supercritical geothermal reservoirs near the brittle-to-ductile transition in the crust.
“We have shown that the brittle-to-ductile transition is not a cutoff for fluid circulation in the crust, which is promising for the exploitation of deep geothermal reservoirs. There are very few in situ data available, and these are among the first experimental results that shed light on such extreme conditions.”
Violay’s coauthors of the Nature Communications
#### What’s Happening?
The consistency of superhot, superdeep rock is similar to that of Silly Putty. “If you pull it slowly, it stretches out and becomes elastic. But if you pull a chunk of Silly Putty really quickly, it snaps. And that is brittle behavior,”
In other words, he continues, “if you stress the rock slowly enough under these extreme conditions, it may stretch and not fracture. This work shows that rock will shatter under these conditions, but it needs to be stressed quickly to do so.”
The research confirms theoretical work reported earlier this year in Geothermal Energyshowing that the cracks that form create a dense “cloud of permeability” throughout the affected rock. This is in contrast to the much larger and fewer macroscopic fractures induced by the engineered geothermal systems (EGS) in use today, which operate closer to the surface and at much lower temperatures.
As a result, the simulations involved in the Geothermal Energy
#### Unique Experimental Machine
Garrison notes that there are very few facilities in the world capable of making the measurements conducted at EPFL.
Says Violay, “The best part [of this research] was the development of a unique experimental machine capable of reproducing the pressure, temperature, and deformation conditions of deep supercritical reservoirs near the brittle-to-ductile transition. Additionally, we were able to combine these experimental results with in situ X-ray images obtained the ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility), offering a comprehensive view of the processes involved.”
In addition to Quaise Energy, this work was funded by the European Research Council, the Swiss National Science Foundation, The European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, and Alta Rock Energy.

![](
With the feasibility phase now complete, the project is poised to produce up to approximately 30 MW of emissions-free, baseload power on completion of its initial two phases — marking a major milestone for geothermal energy in Canada.
Despite Canada’s vast geothermal potential, the resource has remained largely untapped due to economic and technical challenges tied to conventional extraction methods. DEEP’s geothermal project will leverage proven approaches from conventional field development in oil & gas, to deploy advanced horizontal drilling techniques to access some of the most productive zones in the formation, as well as production enhancement technologies to optimize output of geothermal energy generation.
This cutting-edge methodology, supported by SLB’s global expertise in geothermal technology, integrated well construction, and extensive regional drilling experience, represents a first-of-its-kind application for geothermal development in Canada.
“We are thrilled to welcome SLB as a key partner in this transformative project, which also includes Ormat as part of an integrated geothermal asset development model,”
_“By joining forces, we are developing our asset in a streamlined fashion, combining the best of subsurface and surface technologies, while maximizing efficiencies, operations, and ultimately, power output. With this approach, we hope to establish a blueprint for the development of additional commercial geothermal projects in Canada. This project is not only a major step forward for our company, but also should represent a meaningful contribution to Canada’s goals to reduce emissions and secure local energy resources.”_
![]( operations at the DEEP geothermal site in Saskatchewan, Canada (source: DEEP)
As a part of the collaboration between DEEP and SLB on this project, SLB will provide engineering design and integrated well construction services for phases one and two of the project, including the development of two production and two injection wells in phase one and up to 18 wells in phase two. The innovative approach will leverage the natural permeability of the sedimentary rock formation and enable the reliable, cost-efficient, and more sustainable production of geothermal energy.
confirming the 40-year sustainability of the resource based on DEEP’s operational plan.
“This collaboration with DEEP reflects our commitment to broadening the adoption of geothermal by reducing project risk and accelerating the time to first power,”The project’s innovative engineering design and integrated asset development model brings together developers, technology providers and infrastructure partners to open new frontiers for geothermal power generation in Canada and beyond.”
By creatively addressing the perceived barriers to geothermal development in Canada, DEEP’s project is set to establish a new benchmark for the renewable energy sector. The collaboration between DEEP and SLB on this project signals a shared commitment to unlocking geothermal energy’s full potential, paving the way for a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.

The US Department of Energy has published a report highlighting the pathways for commercial liftoff of geothermal heating and cooling technologies.

The “Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Geothermal Heating and Cooling,”
The report presents a pathway for the expansion of the domestic geothermal industry in the US specifically in the geothermal heating and cooling sector. These technologies are important but underutilized solutions for supporting a more resilient and efficient national energy system, as well as reducing emissions from buildings. Widespread deployment of geothermal heat pumps (GHPs) can help reduce peak electricity demand while also generating savings for both utilities and ratepayers.
Key findings from the Geothermal Heating and Cooling Liftoff report include:
* The proposed pathway to commercial-scale adoption of geothermal heating and cooling technologies relies first on scaling geothermal heat pump (GHP) installations in new constructions through 2035, thereafter increasing the focus on retrofits of existing buildings. New builds present lower barriers for installation but represent a smaller market segment.
* A near-term target of GHP installation in 7 million homes will require an investment between USD 100 – 150 billion of capital. Broad market penetration by 2050 can be achieved by an annual ~10% growth, reaching an equivalent of 36 million homes by 2050. These goals will require a robust GHP workforce growth, more efficient installations, and simplified permitting, certification, and utility rate and incentive programs.
* Tax incentives, utility incentives, and energy savings play a crucial role in helping customers offset the initial cost of GHP systems.
To complement the report, the US DOE will be hosting a webinar on 16 January on the topic of geothermal heating and cooling featuring senior DOE leadership.

The release of this Liftoff Report follows the 2024 release of the Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Next-Generation Geothermal Power report and DOE’s 2023 release of an analysis highlighting impacts of mass deployment of GHPs, including the potential to reduce electricity demand by up to 13% by 2050 relative to decarbonizing without GHPs and avoiding as much as 43,500 miles of new transmission lines.

The deadline for full application will be on 22 April 202524 February 2025
An information session will be hosted by GTO and ConnectWerx on 27 January 2025
#### About the funding opportunity
The overall intent of this initiative is to accelerate the responsible deployment of geothermal energy in multiple underdeveloped regions of the U.S. by addressing specific barriers to deployment in each area. These barriers include a lack of adequate public data to guide and incentivize geothermal exploration activities, financial barriers that impede exploratory drilling, and limited technical expertise in certain stakeholder organizations.
This initiative will build upon previous and ongoing work that has focused primarily on the Great Basin region of the United States and will support expanded efforts in regions such as, but not limited to, the southern Basin and Range, the Pacific Northwest (including Alaska), and Hawaii. It will allow for tailored approaches to accommodate the relevant regional factors such as resource type, climate, energy prices, community and local stakeholder values/culture, data gaps, etc. It may also help to achieve economies of scale in procuring and executing capital intensive and highly technical field work.
Participants are expected to collaborate in identifying data gaps as well as prioritizing, planning, and executing geothermal data collection and dissemination activities with the aim of incentivizing and stimulating follow-up geothermal exploration and development activities. The focus should be on pre-competitive data, i.e., datasets that would benefit multiple stakeholders if not the entire geothermal industry. The goal is to make all newly collected data publicly available within a reasonable timeframe. A limited embargo period may be allowed, where necessary, to incentivize industry participation.
ConnectWerx, in partnership with DOE, will coordinate the collection of applications, selection of partnership performers, negotiation of Business to Business (B2B) Agreements, and administer funds. DOE expects to make approximately 6 awards totaling approximately $19 million with this initiative. It is the project lead’s responsibility to develop and manage the scope, schedule and budget within the partnership. There will be a 20% minimum non-federal cost share requirement. It is anticipated that awards will range from $1M to $5M in federal share.
Applicants are encouraged to develop project concepts that are scalable from the low end of this range to the maximum, thus allowing DOE maximum flexibility in making selections that will optimize the overall portfolio. This could be accomplished by describing two separate project scopes for a high and a low budget scenario, or by constructing the project from multiple independent tasks such that DOE can select a subset of the proposed work for funding without compromising the overall project.

# Solicitation – Novel approaches to geothermal power for US Air Force, Army, Navy

![ ](
![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 12 Nov 2024
A solicitation call is currently open for geothermal developers, technology, and service providers to work on projects with the U.S. Air Force, Army, and Navy.
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
The United States Air Force (Department of the Air Force / DAF) currently has an open solicitation call for novel approaches to generate electricity at its installations using geothermal energy. The call is open until 3 January 2025.
The official solicitation can be viewed
#### Expanded scope
An amendment made to the original solicitation significantly expands the scope of the call, as well as the potential benefits to vendors deemed as qualified. The opportunity is thus not limited to Travis Air Force Base.
Although originally published by the DAF, the Tradewinds geothermal solicitation has a much wider scope of benefits for the selected vendors. Those with submissions that are deemed “awardable” will be able to pursue geothermal projects anywhere in the world with the U.S. Air Force, Army, and Navy at any time in the future without having to engage in any further competition.
The process allows “awardable” vendors to to engage in iterative, strategic conversations with the Departments of the Air Force, Army, and Navy without having to worry about artificial solicitation timelines, thus also shortening the time for geothermal project development. This solicitation allows for multiple vendors to be deemed “awardable.”
#### Problem statement
DAF installations largely rely on off-site electricity to conduct its globe-spanning, national security missions on land and in air, sea, space, and cyberspace. Dependence on off-site electricity, however, creates mission risks, because electrical grids are susceptible to outages from extreme weather and cybersecurity attacks by determined adversaries.
To maintain mission continuity and comply with congressional mandates to maintain energy resilience for all critical missions at each installation, DAF is seeking novel approaches to generate electricity at its installations using geothermal energy, because it can provide, continuous, resilient, carbon-free electricity regardless of weather conditions. While current renewable energy solutions such as wind and solar can supply on-site energy, such solutions provide intermittent power and require battery energy storage or other solutions to maintain energy resilience, unlike geothermal energy.
Despite its advantages, there are numerous technological and geological barriers to geothermal energy that have hindered the U.S. government’s ability to construct a utility-scale geothermal facility on federal land to directly supply electricity to its missions. While newer geothermal technologies such as advanced geothermal (i.e., closed-loop) and enhanced geothermal technologies hold the promise of producing power without having to rely on naturally occurring, hot, underground, water resources, such technologies do not currently exist at utility-scale.
Given the recent introduction of these new technologies, DAF is seeking to conduct a business process prototype to determine whether these technologies are technically and economically feasible at DAF installations in the United States. Under the prototype, the selected vendor(s) would (a) gather data through geoscientific exploration, (b) map out the resource, (c) develop an engineering design for a utility-scale facility to produce electricity and green hydrogen through electrolysis to power fuel cells, and (d) propose a deal structure for the sale of the electricity and hydrogen to DAF and others.
If electricity production is technically and economically feasible, the prototype project may be considered further for future construction of a utility-scale facility for the production of electricity and hydrogen. DAF would not execute a long-term contract under the prototype to purchase the electricity and hydrogen commodities. Rather, DAF would execute a sole-source, follow-on contract only after the prototype has been successfully completed. Once the follow-on contract has been executed, construction of the facilities could proceed. DAF would not own the facilities, rather it is expected that a third party would own, operate, and maintain them. The government may also consider scaling a successful prototype to other DAF installations in the United States.
#### How to apply
Interested applicants will need to submit a video pitch via the
There are five required elements that each video submission must address:
1. Identification of the Problem(s) addressed
2. Description of the technology or service solution and its application to the problem(s) identified.
* Technical: Approach to conducting any geoscientific exploration, remote sensing, mapping, drilling, etc., and integrating the data into a robust resource conceptual model. Identify any teaming that may be necessary to complete this approach.
* Environmental: Details on plans for conducting all environmental analysis (e.g. National Environmental Policy Act). Identify any teaming that may be necessary to complete this approach.
3. Potential impact of the solution if adopted by DoD
* Examples: Provide case studies or examples on how to design a utility-scale facility (at least 5 megawatts) to meet and perhaps exceed the energy customer’s electricity or hydrogen needs cost-effectively.
4. Differentiation from other technology and service solutions which address the same or similar problem(s)
5. Pricing Model
* Financing: Details on plans for fully financing (100%) the prototype with DAF providing land, site control, and access to an installation’s facilities for the prototype project.
#### The DoD as a first-mover on geothermal technologies
The DoD is a risk taker and first mover on many cutting-edge technologies. Geothermal is the Air Force’s number one energy resilience technology priority given its promise of being able to provide resilient, 24/7 baseload power to Air Force installations. Thus, the Air Force created this process so that they and the other Services could be first movers and easily work with the geothermal industry.
The DoD has been very active in recent years in engaging with geothermal developers and technology providers. In late 2023, the DoD signed contracts with Eavor Technologies, TEVERRA, and Zanskar Geothermal and Minerals to evaluate geothermal resources and viability at their sites in California, Idaho, Texas and Alaska. This was further expanded in mid-2024 with contracts with Fervo Energy, Sage Geosystems, and GreenFire Energy.

The
Geothermie Delft is a project by partners Shell Geothermal, Energie Beheer Nederland (EBN), TU Delft, and Aardyn. The project will serve as a research facility to gather data that will reduce the risk of future geothermal projects. It will also soon supply geothermal heat to buildings on the TU Delft campus and households in the Delft districts of Voorhof and Buitenhof.
In late 2023, the project reported the completion of drilling of a geothermal doublet. Core samples were also collected from the wells, which successfully penetrated the Delft Sandstone formation and tapped into a geothermal resource with temperature of 78 °C. Since then, work had already started on the construction of a heat pump plant.

The financing by Rabobank and the Dutch Water Board Bank underlines that geothermal energy is a solid investment category within the sustainable energy sector. This project proves that geothermal heat is not only technically and operationally feasible in the built environment, but also financeable within the regular banking sector.
“This transaction demonstrates that renewable heat projects can fully compete with other large-scale energy investments,”“The confidence of institutional financiers confirms that geothermal energy is a robust solution within the energy transition.”
For Rabobank and the Dutch Water Board Bank, this investment means a strengthening of their sustainable portfolio. By providing capital to infrastructure projects that contribute to climate goals, they strengthen their position in financing the energy transition.

KenGen Managing Director Peter Njenga further added that the company has already secured financial backing from various lenders for a 300 MW geothermal project at Menengai. The company continues with efforts to engage with financial institutions to further support the initiative, including the German government.
“This initiative is a testament to the Government’s commitment to achieving a 100 per cent transition to tapping electricity from green sources by the year 2030 and turning away from fossil sources,”
Regulatory filings have already indicated KenGen’s plans of building the Olkaria VII geothermal power plant with an installed capacity of 80.3 MW. This is on top of efforts to rehabilitate and uprate the Olkaria I geothermal power plant, and optimize power plant operations by utilizing waste heat. The company also seeks to diversify revenue streams from geothermal resources with a geothermal-powered Green Energy Park, geothermal drilling contracts in neighboring African countries, and an ongoing geothermal exploration project in Eswatini.
#### Sustained support from Germany
The announcement was made during a visit to Kenya by German Vice-Chancellor and Minister of Economic Affairs Robert Habeck. The Vice-Chancellor led a German delegation of more than 800 members of the German Investment Forum to explore areas of investment and cooperation between Germany and Kenya. Part of the visit was a tour of the Olkaria geothermal wells and power plant facilities.

Habeck stated that Germany will continue to provide both financial and technical expertise to support the growth of the geothermal industry in Kenya, thus helping the country to transition to 100% renewable energy by 2030. Just last year, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited the Olkaria geothermal fields and expressed support for KenGen’s efforts to expand the installed capacity in Olkaria.
Through the development bank KfW, Germany has already financed energy projects in Kenya with more than EUR 248 million.

The city of Hattingen, Germany is considering geothermal, among other renewables, as it strives to achieve a climate-neutral heating supply by 2045.
![](

![](

![](
![](
![](
![](
The local utility company of the city of Hattingen in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, have completed analysis of potential renewable sources for heat and power, and have cited that geothermal could potentially supply the city’s entire heat demand.
The study on geothermal potential was done by the“Purely mathematically, geothermal energy could cover the city’s entire heat demand,”
“However, the heat must be used directly on-site with a high connection density, as transport over long distances – even from one end of the city to the other – is economically and technically impractical. Therefore, we are defining suitable locations and areas for geothermal drilling within the framework of the target scenarios.”
Other renewable sources, including solar thermal energy, river heat, and mine water, were included in the study. River heat can potentially provide an output of 20 MWth and could be an interesting option for heat consumers along the Ruhr. Further potential is available from the dewatering of the former “Friedlicher Nachbar” mine.
For renewable electricity sources, the utility company has analyzed the potential of photovoltaics and wind power. Existing solar systems currently generate around 13.6 GWh while existing wind turbines generate 4.1 GWh. There is room for growth, particularly with a photovoltaic potential of around 150 GWh. However, daily and seasonal fluctuations will have to be considered for these energy sources.
The results of the potential analysis provide a valuable basis for further planning. In the coming weeks, Hattingen Municipal Utilities and the GWI will develop concrete target scenarios to systematically advance the transition to a climate-neutral heat supply in Hattingen.

a previously signed 15-year contract for 30 MW.
The commitment to supply 48 MW of geothermal power will support the growing demand for clean energy across the 35 communities that CPA serves. Under the 2021 California mandate, CPA is required to secure 1000 MW of non-weather-dependent, zero-emission baseload energy.
“CPA is committed to serving our customers with clean, reliable electricity and our ongoing partnership with Fervo Energy allows us to leverage their breakthrough technology to access geothermal, one of the cleanest sources of power,”
“This agreement is another milestone in our efforts to provide long-term power reliability to communities and continue our momentum in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.”
Through the PPA, Fervo Energy will deliver geothermal power from Beaver County, Utah to California’s regional grid. The geothermal power facility is expected to start operations by the second quarter of 2028. Moreover, the project is expected to create about 200 temporary jobs during construction and 15-30 full time jobs when operational.
In mid-2024, Fervo Energy signed a 15-year 32o-MW PPA with another California utility company, Southern Californian Edison (SCE). The contracts signed with these off-takers are an important element of developing the Cape Station geothermal power project of Fervo Energy, which has achieved success in demonstrating the scalability of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) through breakthroughs in drilling and reservoir stimulation.
“Fervo is proving that geothermal is not only commercially viable but also ready for large-scale deployment today,”
“As a stable and reliable source of carbon-free energy, next-generation geothermal is an essential complement to intermittent resources like solar and wind. We’re excited to deliver always-on, clean power to CPA’s millions of residential and business customers across Southern California and demonstrate how geothermal can strengthen and stabilize the grid.”

The 7-MW Berlin binary geothermal power plant in El Salvador has already been installed, is undergoing testing, and is expected to be operational later this year. This announcement was made by Daniel Alvarez, the Head of the General Directorate of Energy, Hydrocarbons, and MINES (DGEHM).
Moreover, power generation of the Ahuachapan geothermal power plant has been improved in recent months, allowing it to add an additional 2 MW of capacity.
With a total of 204 MWe of installed geothermal capacity between the Ahuachapan and Berlin geothermal power plants, geothermal provides about 21% of the net electricity supply in El Salvador. Both facilities are managed by state-owned a focal point for geothermal development in the Central American region.
The Berlin binary power plant is considered a major milestone, as it is the first geothermal power plant that has been built in El Salvador since 2007. The power plant was supplied by Turboden according to an agreement signed in 2019.
Moreover, Alvarez assured that work on the Chinameca, San Miguel, and San Vicente are progressing. When developed, the first stage of development in these sites will add 50 MW to the installed geothermal power capacity of El Salvador. However, the World Bank will be supporting a second stage of development that will add another 100 MW.

“With lighthouse expertise from the oil and gas sector, highlighted by co-founder and CTO Silviu Livescu’s experience as the Chief Scientist of Pressure Pumping at Baker Hughes, Bedrock is poised for significant growth”
“Heating and cooling buildings is the largest energy expense in real estate, and geothermal HVAC can cut that energy bill in half, improve resilience, and reduce air pollutants for residents by 90%,” said Joselyn Lai, co-founder and CEO, Bedrock Energy. “Bedrock’s innovations make geothermal installations so affordable that real estate developers and owners across the US can generate a strong financial return and boost their property values, with just their HVAC choice. We’re grateful that our investors share our conviction about unlocking geothermal for widespread scale, and humbled that they consider Bedrock to be the right team for the challenge.”
Bedrock Energy has pioneered geothermal design and installation technologies, including advanced subsurface thermal simulation capabilities and an intelligent construction platform for geothermal borefield construction. The company’s deployment teams use these innovations to install geothermal heat pump systems for real estate owners at faster schedule, higher accuracy and performance, and stronger cost efficiencies. These systems can range from single-structure commercial buildings to connected district systems serving multiple lots. By unlocking scalable geothermal heating and cooling as a resilient, always-on category of distributed clean energy, Bedrock aims to save billions of dollars for both property owners and utilities alike.
“Geothermal energy has incredible promise as an always-on, 24/7 carbon-free source of power and heating and cooling. We believe that Bedrock Energy has developed several unique, integrated technologies that will dramatically open up the market for cost efficient geothermal heating and cooling of buildings and change the economics of this industry,” said Mark Sherman, Managing Partner for Titanium Ventures.
“With lighthouse expertise from the oil and gas sector, highlighted by co-founder and CTO Silviu Livescu’s experience as the Chief Scientist of Pressure Pumping at Baker Hughes, Bedrock is poised for significant growth,” added Albert Bielinko, Titanium Ventures Alumnus. “We’ve been so impressed by Jos, Silviu, and the early lead they have established in this space.”
In addition to energy savings, geothermal heating and cooling has an unparalleled impact on moderating power demand in extreme temperatures, bringing immense value to customers, utilities, and regulators alike. According to Oak Ridge National Laboratory1, adoption of geothermal heat pumps in 70% of U.S. buildings could avoid seven gigatons of carbon-equivalent emissions by 2050 and save 24,500 miles of transmission line construction by offsetting needs from the power grid.
“Amid the economy-wide trends of electrification across industries, reducing demand will only grow more critical in the years ahead,” said Jenny Gao at Energy Impact Partners. “We need to electrify quickly, yet deliberately; Bedrock exemplifies this approach as well as any company we’ve seen.”
In 2025, Bedrock plans to deploy new geothermal systems across Colorado, Utah, and other Mountain West states. This expansion builds upon the company’s recently completed project in Morgan County, Utah, and ongoing work on a district geothermal system coming online in 2025 for a new business park in Hayden, Colorado. The latter project is supported by the Colorado Energy Office, Colorado Department of Local Affairs, Northwest Colorado Business District, and Town of Hayden.
“Bedrock has been an excellent partner in the design and planning of our geothermal system. We are excited to leverage their drilling innovations to help us supply resilient geothermal heating & cooling energy for a flagship economic development project in a coal transition community,” said Mathew Mendisco, Town Manager of Hayden. “Tapping into renewable subsurface energy right on-site is key to expediting construction timelines, lowering energy costs, and creating resiliency in mountainous regions like ours. Geothermal may be a valuable driver of successful coal transition, and Bedrock will be a key company in making that a reality in Northwest Colorado.”
We previously reported on the company’s inaugural geothermal HVAC project in Austin, Texas.

The full statement (in different languages) can be downloaded
The statement refers to geothermal as a largely untapped resource in Europe, and thus offering plenty of opportunities for EU Member States to harness it as part of energy transition efforts. According to the European Geothermal Energy Council (EGEC), geothermal energy can provide around 25% of heating and cooling consumption and around 10% of electricity consumption in Europe.
Despite the favourable characteristics of geothermal, the industry faces several challenges:
* There is often a lack of capacity in licensing agencies and cumbersome authorisation procedures;
* Easily accessible geological data or data on energy use are also often lacking;
* Due to a lack of technological knowledge, feasibility studies sometimes do not focus on the total lifetime cost, which underestimates the lifetime of geothermal power plants compared to solutions with shorter lifetimes, which may seem cheaper. Few countries provide statistics on the numbers of installed GHPs, geothermal district heating and cooling systems, etc.;
* Financial risk reduction is typical for larger projects, especially new entrants, which carry resource and project development risks
Aside from geothermal’s more obvious benefits as a stable and emissions-free source of energy, the locality-bound nature of geothermal also promotes the development of independent and self-sufficient local energy communities. This means that regions can reduce their dependence on both locally produced and imported fossil fuels, and reduces network exposure to natural disasters and human factors such as politics and war.
#### Geothermal needs public and political support
However, the EESC believes that Member State intervention is needed to sustainably promote the growth of geothermal in Europe. Government funding and incentives are needed to attract and de-risk initial investments. Changes in energy policy or financing are also critical in improving the economic attractiveness of geothermal projects.
It is necessary to accurately identify risks related to environmental impacts and to ensure that the construction of geothermal power plants is pursued with the involvement of local communities, thus increasing public acceptance. It is important to stress that the environmental and climate benefits of geothermal energy outweigh the risks as it is one of the best renewable energy sources in terms of land use, resource use and import dependency.
Thus, the EESC calls on the Commission to launch a European programme to assess geothermal energy production areas in order to meet its drilling data needs, as well as remove regulatory barriers to planning and permitting needs.

The Alberta Drilling Accelerator is intended to be an open-access, technology-agnostic program that will allow for testing of drilling technologies in challenging environments including deep depths, high temperatures, and varying rock types. It will support technologies across the spectrum of the energy industry including in oil and gas, geothermal, critical minerals, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage.
A location for the hub is yet to be determined, but the target is for the Alberta Drilling Accelerator to start drilling by 2026 at the latest.
“The Alberta Drilling Accelerator means big things for oil and gas exploration in our province, but also for industries that will be vital for achieving our goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. We are setting the stage for innovation and prosperity, pushing Alberta’s drilling expertise to places it’s never been before,”
“The Alberta Drilling Accelerator will take Alberta’s expertise from oil and gas to help us become the global leader in drilling innovation for industries like geothermal, to critical minerals,”
The $50 million investment of Alberta for the hub will come from the industry-fundedA previous $750,000 investment had already been made by the Government of Alberta on the project for a feasibility study led by Eavor Technologies in partnership with the Canadian Association of Energy Contractors and Canadian Geothermal Energy Association. The study concluded that the project is both economically and environmentally viable.
The project has also received the support of major industry players like Tourmaline Oil Corp. and Halliburton. While no contracts have been signed with these companies, this bodes well for securing capital investment from the private sector.
“Alberta has the resources and expertise to become a world leader in geothermal innovation. The Alberta Drilling Accelerator will be a beacon for collaboration and the development of made-in-Alberta geothermal technologies that advance global energy security and carbon neutrality,”
“We are very proud to support the Alberta Drilling Accelerator because we believe the best, most innovative solutions come through collaboration.

The FM EEA mechanism—a collaboration between Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway—has driven European renewable energy projects. This project aligns with its overarching goal to bridge knowledge, technology, and infrastructure gaps between participating countries. It also represents a significant step towards meeting Europe’s climate goals, as set out in the European Green Deal.
Poland has significant geothermal resources, primarily low-temperature, suitable for direct applications such as district heating, bathing, and industrial processes. However, limited infrastructure and regulatory hurdles have hindered full exploitation. Iceland, in contrast, has emerged as a global leader in geothermal energy. With advanced geothermal systems supporting 90% of its central heating and contributing 30% of its electricity production, Iceland exemplifies how to harness this renewable resource effectively.
However, at the end of 2022, Poland operated ten geothermal district heating systems with a combined capacity of 123.4 MW, marking a 26% increase since 2019. Additionally, shallow geothermal technologies, including heat pumps, have grown significantly, with over 900 MW of capacity installed by 2022.
The FM EEA framework offers Poland access to Icelandic expertise, creating sustainable development and mutual learning opportunities. Despite progress, the geothermal sector’s share in Poland’s energy mix remains marginal. Challenges such as limited infrastructure, high initial investment costs, and regulatory complexities hinder further development. Meanwhile, Iceland has established itself as a global leader in geothermal energy. Iceland’s geothermal resources support 90% of its central heating and contribute 30% of its electricity production, demonstrating the transformative potential of these resources when harnessed effectively.
The collaboration under the Geothermal Synergy project bridges Poland’s aspirations and Iceland’s achievements, fostering a mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and expertise.
#### History of geothermal utilisation in Iceland
Icelanders have utilised geothermal energy since the Saga age, and the first settlers of Iceland in the 9th century, though, for the first centuries, this utilisation was very localised and had low intensity.
In the Saga of Grettir the Strong, the protagonist swims from the island of Drangey where he was in exile to the mainland where he warms himself up in a geothermal pool now called Grettir’s Pool. In the Laxdæla saga one of the main protagonists, Gudrún Ósvífirsdóttir, spends a lot of time in the warm pool that became her namesake. Geothermal pools were also used for cooking and washing clothes during this period, although this was only done as part of domestic life for those lucky enough to have such a pool nearby.
Around 1000, the Icelandic parliament, Althingi, decided to convert the country to Christianity. The local waters of lake Thingvallavatn are icy cold, so all the members were baptised in a warm spring called Vígdalaug (Consecrated Pool) near Laugavatn, some 25 kilometres away.
Later, during the Sturlunga Age in the mid 13th century, one of the chieftains, Snorri Sturluson, built a pool called Snorralaug (Snorri’s Pool) near his home at Reykholt. There is also evidence that he piped hot water into his home for direct use there. This is the first evidence of what might be called direct manipulation of geothermal waters or pools to benefit the population in Iceland. Before that, there is little evidence of manipulation of geothermal waters.
During the late Middle Ages and the 18th century, Icelanders mined sulphur for export. They did this near geothermal areas, though mainly since that was where sulphur was mostly concentrated and easy to mine.
So, throughout Iceland’s early history, geothermal pools and waters were used for various small scale, localised uses, from simple bathing pools to places of healing, for cooking or boiling food, washing clothes, and for more ceremonial purposes such as baptisms. The only large-scale utilisation came more from the sulphuric byproduct of geothermal activity than any direct use.

Industrial, or large-scale use of geothermal, did not begin in Iceland until the early 20th century when farmers in Mosfellssveit, just north-east of Reykjavík, started to pipe geothermal water into greenhouses to grow crops and for other industrial purposes. In 1930, the Reykjavík District Heating Company first set up a district heating system using geothermal water to heat buildings. Among the first buildings to be heated in this way were the Austurbæjarskóli school and Sundhöll Reykjavíkur, the Reykjavík Swimming Palace.
World War II put a pause in the plans to exploit geothermal energy in Iceland further, but after the war they continued at a moderate pace. The first geothermal power plant was opened in 1969 at Bjarnarflag in the North-East of Iceland, at 3 MW. Following the oil shock of the early and mid 1970s, the Icelandic government decided to ramp up the development of geothermal utilisation for both heating homes and power production, following recommendations from a study done by the National Energy Authority in 1970.
The Svartsengi power plant (from which the Blue Lagoon gets its waters from), was commissioned in 1976, and the following year the Krafla power plant in the north-east started production. Svartsengi also provided hot water for space heating to nearby towns. From 1990 to 2017 five more geothermal plants have been commissioned, all producing electricity, but some also providing hot water for municipalities and homes. The combined MW capacity for these plants is around 780 MW of electricity and around 850 MW thermal.
Various small and large district heating systems have also been opened up in Iceland over the past 50 years, ranging from small scale operations where farms and greenhouses are heated up with a local borehole, to entire towns benefiting from a central, geothermal heating system. By 2020, geothermal energy accounted for 89.6% of the energy used for space heating in buildings in Iceland.
Iceland’s rapid advances in utilising geothermal energy for the benefit of society led to her participating in the foundation of the United Nations University in the late 1970s through the creation of the United Nations University have received training in Iceland in all forms of geothermal exploration and utilisation from dozens of developing nations. Between 1991 and 2003, 14 Fellows from Poland received training at the UNU-GTP and went on to help build Poland’s geothermal infrastructure.
#### Geothermal energy in Poland
Poland’s geothermal energy sector has deep historical roots and significant potential for future expansion. While Poland’s history of geothermal use differs from Iceland’s, its resources offer unique opportunities for sustainable energy development. The country has been steadily developing its geothermal energy sector, particularly in direct use applications such as district heating, recreation, and balneotherapy.
The earliest evidence of geothermal use in Poland dates back centuries, particularly in regions like Ladek-Zdrój in Lower Silesia and Jaszczurówka in the Podhale region. Historical accounts suggest that hot springs were used for bathing and therapeutic purposes as early as the 13th century. The 19th and early 20th centuries saw increased interest in geothermal waters, particularly in the context of health resorts and balneotherapy.
Notable figures in Polish scientific history, such as Dr. Ludwik Zejszner and Prof. Stanislaw Sokolowski, contributed to early geothermal research. Their work laid the foundation for the systematic geological surveys that began in the 20th century, identifying Poland’s geothermal potential.
The modern era of geothermal development in Poland began with deeper exploration in the 1960s and 1970s. The first experimental geothermal wells were drilled in the Podhale region, confirming the feasibility of using geothermal energy for heating.

One of the most significant milestones came in 1979-1981, when the Banska IG-1 well was drilled to a depth of 5,261 meters, yielding thermal water with a temperature of 82°C. This discovery paved the way for the creation of Poland’s first large-scale geothermal district heating system in Zakopane and surrounding areas.
By 1992-1993, the Podhale Geothermal Heating Plant (Geotermia Podhalanska S.A.) was established, marking the beginning of large-scale geothermal heating in Poland with the contribution of MEERI PAS 1st Experimental Geothermal Plant in Poland, 1980/90s initiated geoDH and other geothermal uses in the country (Part of the Centre for Geothermics and Heat Pumps).
Today, Poland operates several geothermal district heating plants, including:
* Podhale region (Banska Nizna, Zakopane, Bialy Dunajec, Poronin) – one of Central Europe’s largest geothermal district heating networks.
* Mszczonów – pioneering reinjection technology for sustainable use.
* Pyrzyce – an advanced system for municipal heating.
* Uniejów – a model city for geothermal development, combining heating with tourism and balneotherapy.
Additionally, Poland’s geothermal bathing and recreation sector has seen rapid growth. Facilities like Termy Szaflary, Termy Bukovina, Termy Bania, and Chocholowskie Termy highlight how geothermal resources can contribute to local economies.
Poland has actively engaged in international partnerships to accelerate its geothermal development. One of the key initiatives supporting this effort is the Geothermal Synergy Project, a collaborative platform between Poland and Iceland under the EEA grants framework. The project has facilitated knowledge exchange, policy development, and technical cooperation, bringing Poland closer to fully utilising its geothermal potential.
Additionally, Poland is working towards integrating with the
Poland aims to more than double its installed geothermal heating capacity by 2040, focusing on:
* Expanding district heating systems in medium-sized cities.
* Enhancing geothermal electricity production through pilot projects.
* Integrating geothermal with other renewable sources, such as biomass and solar energy.
* Developing regulatory frameworks to streamline geothermal project implementation.
While geothermal electricity production remains limited, Poland is exploring advanced technologies to increase efficiency and economic viability. The lessons from Iceland’s regulatory and technological success provide a valuable reference for Poland’s policymakers, energy developers, and municipalities.
Geothermal energy in Poland is at a turning point, with increasing investments, international collaborations, and a strong policy push toward sustainable energy diversification. As Poland continues to develop its geothermal heating and energy solutions, cooperation with Iceland and participation in European frameworks will be instrumental in accelerating innovation and market deployment.
With the right strategies and partnerships, Poland has the potential to become a leader in Central European geothermal energy development, ensuring a cleaner, more resilient energy future for its citizens.
#### Comparative geothermal conditions
Poland and Iceland have distinct geothermal characteristics, shaped by their geological settings. Poland’s geothermal resources are predominantly low-temperature, typically 40-90°C, making them well-suited for district heating, balneotherapy, and industrial applications. In contrast, Iceland benefits from high-temperature geothermal fields, often exceeding 250°C, enabling electricity generation and large-scale heating systems.
Despite these differences, the two countries complement each other in geothermal advancements. Poland can learn from Iceland’s well-established district heating systems, reservoir management strategies, and reinjection techniques to improve resource sustainability. Meanwhile, Iceland can benefit from Poland’s innovative integration of geothermal with multi-source energy systems, such as Konin’s hybrid model combining geothermal, biomass, and solar energy.
By leveraging Icelandic expertise, Poland can accelerate the expansion of its geothermal sector, while Iceland can explore new applications of its technology in lower-temperature settings. This cooperation fosters mutual innovation and strengthens both nations’ contributions to Europe’s renewable energy transition.
#### Objectives of the Geothermal Synergy project
A key element of the Geothermal Synergy Project is the engagement of top specialists and experts in geothermal energy from Poland and Iceland to foster collaboration at the public authority level. While Poland and Iceland have different geological properties, many aspects of geothermal utilisation, policy development, and technological deployment remain universal. The project seeks to adapt best practices to Poland’s evolving geothermal sector by showcasing Iceland’s successful geothermal model.
The project is built upon three primary objectives:
1. Knowledge exchange and technical support
The project facilitates the transfer of Icelandic expertise to Polish stakeholders, focusing on geothermal exploration, cascading resource usage, and operational best practices. By learning from Iceland’s advanced geothermal experience, Poland can maximise the efficiency and sustainability of its geothermal reserves. This exchange also ensures Polish specialists gain practical insights into drilling techniques, district heating solutions, and environmental impact management.
2. Policy development and regulatory adaptation**
** One of the main goals is to support Poland in developing and implementing effective geothermal policies by adapting Iceland’s proven regulatory frameworks. This includes community engagement strategies, simplified permitting processes, and financial incentives that have successfully driven Iceland’s geothermal expansion. The project aims to reduce investment risks and enhance Poland’s geothermal market viability by integrating these policy measures.
3. Integration into the GEOTHERMICA Initiative**
** Strengthening Poland’s role in the GEOTHERMICA Initiative is fundamental to the project. GEOTHERMICA is a transnational program that promotes research, innovation, and geothermal energy deployment across Europe. Through this integration, Polish stakeholders gain access to cutting-edge geothermal technologies, funding opportunities, and international collaborations that will accelerate geothermal adoption in Poland.
By achieving these objectives, the Geothermal Synergy Project plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between Polish and Icelandic geothermal expertise, fostering international cooperation, and ensuring a sustainable, long-term development strategy for Poland’s geothermal sector.
#### Foundation of the partnership
This project builds on Iceland’s established geothermal expertise and Poland’s need for sustainable energy solutions. Iceland’s innovative models, such as cascading uses of geothermal resources and its circular economy approach, serve as a blueprint for Poland’s energy transition?. The partnership between Poland and Iceland rests on a solid foundation of complementary strengths. Poland’s energy strategy aims to reduce reliance on coal—currently its dominant energy source—and transition to renewables. With its low emissions and steady output, geothermal energy fits seamlessly into this vision.
Iceland brings decades of experience in geothermal development, underpinned by innovative practices and a circular economy mindset. Icelandic companies and institutions have pioneered the integrated use of geothermal resources, utilising residual water, steam, and gases to create value-added products ranging from mineral supplements to aquaculture solutions.
#### Addressing Poland’s needs
Poland’s increasing focus on geothermal energy development is an essential component of its national energy transition and a strategic move in its broader geopolitical framework. As outlined by Prof. Krzysztof Galos, Undersecretary of State and Chief National Geologist, Poland has prioritised geothermal expansion within its National Energy and Climate Program. However, achieving these ambitious goals requires international collaboration, particularly with leading geothermal nations like Iceland and Norway.
One of the most significant drivers of this cooperation is Poland’s engagement in the European Economic Area (EEA) programs, which have provided financial and knowledge-based support for geothermal projects. Through these partnerships, Poland has gained access to best practices, cutting-edge technologies, and policy insights from countries with long-standing geothermal expertise. This aligns well with Poland’s energy security strategy, as reducing reliance on fossil fuels—including imported gas—is a crucial objective of its Multiannual Program for the Development of Geothermal Resources.
Moreover, the integration of Poland into the GEOTHERMICA Initiative—a key European platform dedicated to geothermal energy—illustrates Poland’s commitment to cross-border collaboration. With Iceland leading in this initiative, Poland is well-positioned to accelerate innovation, enhance its policy framework, and foster large-scale investments in geothermal infrastructure.

Geothermal cooling startup These campaigns mark a significant step forward in advancing geothermal energy applications—specifically geothermal cooling and heating—as a viable, efficient, and sustainable solution for the region.
#### Key findings from the campaign
The campaigns involved drilling over 25 wellbores at varying depths of up to 250 meters, conducting more than 18 Thermal Response Tests (TRT), as well as multiple Open-Loop Geothermal Tests and Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) Tests. These efforts provided critical insights into the geothermal potential across different geological settings in Saudi Arabia.
The key findings are as follows:
* Shallow geothermal reservoirs have shown strong potential for highly efficient open-loop geothermal systems, with a Coefficient of Performance (COP) exceeding 5.5, making them significantly more energy-efficient than conventional cooling technologies.
* Favorable subsurface thermal conductivity and diffusivity values confirm strong heat transfer characteristics, supporting both geothermal cooling and seasonal energy storage.
* ATES testing results support an 80/20 cooling-to-heating split, making it an ideal solution for Saudi Arabia’s climate and energy needs.
* The local supply chain is well-equipped to support geothermal adoption at a scale and quickly, leveraging existing expertise and resources from the oil and gas industry.
* The economic case is strong, with geothermal cooling expected to deliver substantial cost savings compared to conventional air-based systems for various applications.
These findings provide a clear path forward for large-scale geothermal cooling deployment in the Kingdom.

_“The momentum behind geothermal energy in Saudi Arabia is growing, and Strataphy is proud to be a key enabler of this transition. By integrating cutting-edge technology with deep industry expertise, we are accelerating the deployment of geothermal systems that are both commercially viable and environmentally impactful,”_ said Ahmed Alhani, COO at Strataphy.
#### The need for sustainable cooling in Saudi Arabia
With Saudi Arabia experiencing some of the highest cooling demands per capita globally, driven by rapid urbanization and large-scale construction projects, finding clean and efficient cooling solutions is a national priority. Today, 50-70% of the country’s electricity consumption is dedicated to cooling, primarily through conventional air-based systems that rely on fossil fuels and contribute to high CO? emissions.
Geothermal-based cooling presents an alternative that is not only more energy-efficient but also aligns with the country’s broader sustainability goals. Strataphy has been working with sustainability-driven initiatives in Saudi Arabia to help achieve energy efficiency targets, ensuring that cooling—an essential component of the country’s energy strategy—is addressed through innovative and sustainable solutions.
By integrating geothermal cooling, the country can:
* Reduce electricity consumption for cooling by up to 50%, cutting operational costs for businesses and developments;
* Reduce the cost of electrical grid expansion associated with projected growth in cooling demand;
* Improve grid stability, especially during peak summer demand;
* Significantly lower CO? emissions, supporting national and international sustainability commitments;
* Enhance energy security, reducing reliance on fossil-fuel-based cooling systems.
_“Geothermal energy represents a fundamental shift in how we think about sustainable cooling and heating. At Strataphy, we are not just adopting geothermal solutions; we are actively shaping the ecosystem—developing scalable projects that drive efficiency, lower emissions, and redefine energy resilience in the region,”_ said Ammar Alali, CEO at Strataphy.

#### What’s next: Installing geothermal systems in the country
Saudi Arabia is home to some of the largest construction and development projects in the world, driving an increasing demand for cooling. However, the country remains reliant on air-based cooling methods that consume high amounts of electricity and contribute to emissions.
Based on the findings from their recent campaigns, Strataphy is now taking action to implement geothermal cooling solutions at scale. The first fully operational geothermal cooling system in Saudi Arabia will be commissioned before the end of this year, marking the country’s first industrial-scale geothermal cooling project.
More over, two additional geothermal cooling projects will begin installation in summer 2025, with commissioning expected in the near future. Strataphy is also targeting the installation of over 15+ MW-th of geothermal cooling capacity within the next three years, and 50+ MW-th in the next five years – accelerating the adoption of sustainable cooling across the Kingdom.

Government-owned power generation company
KenGen dispatched a total of 8384 GWh of electricity for the past year, also up from 8027 GWh for the same period in 2022-2023. This was a notable feat considering the inconsistent weather conditions in Kenya in the past year. Peter Njenga, KenGen’s Managing Director and CEO, stated that KenGen’s power plants were critical in meeting the 2149 MW of peak electricity demand in Kenya for the period under review.
“This impressive growth not only strengthens our financial position but also signals greater returns for shareholders now and long into the future, while enhancing our ability to invest in critical renewable energy projects providing more affordable, reliable electricity for our consumers,
#### A continued push for green power
KenGen has played a major role in making Kenya a leader in renewable energy in the African region. Kenya produces around 90% of its power from renewable sources and is aiming for 100% by 2030. In support of this goal, KenGen continues to build capacity in renewables in the form of solar power facilities, hydropower stations, and geothermal power plants.
Work is currently ongoing for the rehabilitation of the Olkaria I geothermal power plant to increase its installed capacity from 45 MWe to 63 MWe.. Regulatory filings done earlier this year also indicated KenGen’s plans of building the 80.3-MW Olkaria VII power plant. Moreover, KenGen is eyeing a diversification of revenues from its geothermal business by putting up a Green Energy Park in Olkaria which will supply industrial and commercial facilities with geothermal heat or power.

The City Council of Ferrara, Italy has approved a proposal to expand the scope of geothermal heating supplied by the Casaglia geothermal plant. The EUR 23 million project aims to double the output of the Casaglia geothermal plant, thus allowing for the district heating network to be extended by 5.6 kilometers and reduce CO2 emissions by a further 15,000 tons per year.
The proposal was made by Enel Green Power as part of a temporary business association with Gruppo Hera. In 2020, it was reported that Gruppo Hera will be taking over the Casaglia geothermal plant. This was excellent synergy as Gruppo Hera is also managing the district heating service.
The proposal will involve the drilling of an additional production well to supply more geothermal heating. A reinjection well will also be drilled, and work over of the existing Casaglia-1 well will also be done. The goal would be to increase the contribution of geothermal to the district heating system, which is currently only at 40%. The rest of the heat is supplied by a waste-to-heat plant and gas-fired heating plants.
The geothermal industry of Italy continues to seek for government support to end the decade-long drought of new geothermal power stations in the country.

NREL has designed and demonstrated a novel generator with exceptional performance for downhole power generation during geothermal drilling. GA Drilling will leverage NREL’s expertise to further develop this generator technology by integrating it into their PLASMABIT® Hybrid drilling solution.
“Geothermal energy has the potential to revolutionize clean energy production, and this collaboration with NREL marks a significant step toward making deep geothermal drilling more viable and efficient,” s“By leveraging NREL’s cutting-edge downhole power generation technology along with their research bench, we aim to overcome key technical barriers and accelerate the commercialization of our PLASMABIT Hybrid drilling system.”
High-energy drilling methods are essential for improving penetration rates in hard, hot rock, essential for deep geothermal access. Yet, traditional power supply solutions—such as running an electric cable downhole—pose significant economic and technical challenges.
To address this, NREL has successfully developed and demonstrated a downhole generator capable of producing electricity directly at the drill bit to overcome these obstacles. Designed to operate in temperatures up to 250°C, this breakthrough eliminates the need for external power cables, reducing operational delays and enhancing drilling efficiency. The objective is to progress it to full-scale field testing in commercial drilling systems.
GA Drilling is actively advancing toward full-scale commercialization, with this collaboration providing crucial support for technology refinement and upcoming field testing. The partnership underscores the company’s leadership in geothermal innovation and strengthens its position in emerging ultra deep geothermal markets seeking cost-effective, high-efficiency drilling solutions.

The neighboring cities of Puchheim and Germering in Bavaria, Germany, as well as the Munich municipal utilities, are looking to establish a joint company to develop a geothermal heating project.
The planned geothermal project will involve the drilling of eight boreholes, both for production and reinjections. The planners are assuming a capacity of 52 MWth from the future facility.
These big ambitions also come with significant investment requirements, estimated at EUR 260 million. Funding of around EUR 91 million for the project is expected. Germering is planning to take a 25% stake in the company, Puchheim at 15%, and the rest by other shareholders.
#### Another attempt after previous failures
The situation of the two cities is interesting, in that both of them have attempted geothermal development in the past but failed due to different reasons. A feasibility study for geothermal had been done with Germering. Funding application was done to advance the work, but the project failed to push through due to high costs. In Puchheim, an early-stage initiative for geothermal heating was struck down by a citizens’ vote in 2018 due to fears of property damage from seismic activity.
With the energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine and a stronger drive for energy independence, Puchheim Mayor is hoping that the citizens will now realize the potential of geothermal. Technology had also greatly advanced since then. As the administration expressed in a statement to the city council, none of the geothermal projects in the wider Munich area have caused any damage from seismicity.

“This partnership unites the mission-driven Arverne Group with a solid European pipe manufacturer such as Tenaris. Their combined expertise and strong European focus will accelerate the scalability of geothermal and lithium activities, contributing to the advancement of sustainable energy solutions,”
The Rhine valley, where the geothermal projects are concentrated, presents highly favorable geological conditions, such as deep faults and lithium-rich granites. Lithium, extracted from geothermal waters, is a critical resource for the transition to electric vehicles and more sustainable batteries.
Earlier this year, Lithium de France had reported the completion of 3D seismic exploration campaigns in the Northern Alsace region, specifically within the perimeters of the Exclusive Research Permits “Les Poteries” and “Strasbourg” held by its sister company
With a total cumulative surface area of 310 square kilometers explored in just over 2 years, and an investment of more than 12 million euros, Lithium de France has strengthened its position as the first French independent geothermal heat and lithium operator to have explored such a large surface area in Northern Alsace.
“We are pleased that Lithium de France has chosen Tenaris as the supplier of tubular products and services for this strategic project. This achievement was made possible by our strong local presence, extensive manufacturing capabilities in Europe, comprehensive technical support and services, and vast experience in geothermal development,”
This project marks another step in Tenaris’s contribution to the energy transition.

Utility companies in Germany have published statements on the proposed Geothermal Energy Acceleration Act, citing opportunities and areas for improvement.

With the proposed Geothermal Energy Acceleration Act (GeoWG) in Germany currently still undergoing deliberations, utility companies as well as the German Geothermal Association /
#### Acceleration of approval for geothermal projects
The draft law, first submitted in September 2024, seeks to significantly accelerate the approval procedures for geothermal system, heat pumps, and heat storage systems. Among the provisions in the draft law are proposals to simplify and digitalize the approval procedures, set deadlines to limit the length of the process, reduce the number of authorities involved in the process, and give heat pumps and heat storage greater weight in approval decisions.
The bill was first discussed by the Bundestag in early October 2024, with Bernhard Hermann (B90/Grüne) describing geothermal as a “treasure from the depths,” and that at least a quarter of the heat requirement in Germany can be supplied by geothermal systems.
“With this law, we are sending the industry a decisive signal to recruit more skilled workers and to ensure that projects can be planned more easily. We are closing a gap in renewable energy sources and are thus moving a decisive step away from fossil fuels. This is good news for climate protection and good news for a crisis-proof, independent energy supply,”
“We are very pleased that geothermal energy is receiving strong support across party lines. There is consensus in the democratic parties that the expansion of geothermal energy use should be accelerated,”
The Federal Council (Bundesrat) also expressed support for the draft law. However, they recommended revisions to ensure that drinking water resources are not endangered by geothermal development. The Council also asked the Federal Government to examine whether it is possible to create relief in the emissions control law for seismic measurement campaigns.
Comments from utility companies
Ahead of another hearing by the Federal Government on the draft law, utility companies

Karin Thelen, Managing Director of Regional Energy Transition at SWM and President of the BVG, said that the GeoWG provides an important first step for the acceleration of geothermal growth. However, it still falls short in several key points.
Thelen particularly points out the redundancy of approval procedures for geothermal, where the subsurface is governed by the mining law above-ground facilities are subject to the building law. This complicates the administrative process and should be amended under the Federal Mining Act. Moreover, the water law requirements for large heat pumps should be abolished.
The statement by Deutsche ErdWärme points out that the time periods for project development under the federal funding program for efficient heating networks (BEW) are too short (1 year plus 1 year extension for Module 1; 2 years plus 1 year extension for Module 2). Furthermore, the company cites that there is currently a limited number of contractors and other skilled personnel for geothermal in Germany.
Both statements from SWM and Deutsche ErdWärme emphasize the importance of funding of geothermal power and heat projects through the BEW, and projects at acceptable prices cannot be implemented without this funding.

Having completed drilling of the 5200m Fushen-1 geothermal exploration well in April 2024, the
Sinopec has also conducted reservoir stimulation, water injection, and heat extraction from the exploration well, thus forming a complete set of deep geothermal exploration, development, and utilization analyses. With the data collected from the well, Guo Xusheng of the Chinese Academy of Engineering indicated that says that the project team believes that there is a very rich geothermal resource within the 50 square kilometers around the project site, roughly equivalent to 1.4 billion tons of standard coal resources.
The drilling of the exploration well in the city of Haikou, the capital of the southern Hainan province, started in August 2023. The original objectives of the drilling project – to better characterize the subsurface formation in the region and the potential of geothermal resources in the surrounding area – seem to have been fulfilled.
While concrete plans for the utilization of the well have not been announced, the aim for geothermal in the Hainan region is to generate electricity, provide refrigeration, and produce hot domestic water under a cascade model.

The USA Chapter of
Robin earned a degree in engineering geology and a master’s degree in geology. Having started her career in the oil and gas industry, a relocation to Nevada prompted her to join Ormat and transition to geothermal – at a time when this was not so common yet.
![](
#### A more diverse Exploration team
By 2022, Robin became the Director of Global Exploration at Ormat, leading a team of 17 direct reports across the US and Indonesia. Robin has taken great pride in developing a world-class technical team in Indonesia focused on a culture of empowerment, cross-cultural learning, and challenging norms.
Robin considers her most significant achievement at Ormat to be her efforts to increase diversity within the exploration team at the company. She recognized that the traditional job requirements for field-based geologists were less accessible to many potential candidates, particularly women. Robin worked diligently to modify these requirements to make the roles more accessible. From 2019 to today, the Exploration team went from one woman to seven.
#### Advocating for pro-geothermal policy
Robin currently serves on the board of Geothermal Rising and Chairs the Foundations Committee. She is an active member of the policy, education, and finance committees and has spoken greatly on the complexity of the federal permitting process and how this has hampered the execution of geothermal projects.
Although not originally a policy expert, Robin is now immersing herself more into that area. “I’m hoping to bring some of my experience to support the initiatives that Geothermal Rising is undertaking,”“It’s a crucial time for geothermal energy, and addressing these barriers is essential for our progress.”

ThinkGeoEnergy's Top 10 geothermal news stories for the year 2024 highlighted the diversity of geothermal geographically and in terms of utilization.
![](
![](
![](
As part of our annual tradition, we have collated our website traffic numbers to come up with a list of the Top 10 most-read geothermal news stories
Before jumping to the Top 10 list, it is worth noting that the most-visited page at ThinkGeoEnergy is, by far, our **Global Geothermal Power Plant Map**. This map is at a constant state of change as we periodically look at how we can improve the data or keep it up-to-date. Our Top 10 geothermal countries from the start of 2024 also had plenty of traffic. Surprisingly, the 2023 version of the Top 10 geothermal countries still drew plenty of interest.
Collecting our website data and coming up with a Top 10 list based on visits has always been a great way for us to gauge the level of interest of our readers. It is also our way of saying thank you to you, our readers, for your continued support for ThinkGeoEnergy. On to the Top 10!
![](
Starting off the Top 10 list is the submission of the planning application of Weardale Lithium for the phased construction of a lithium extraction plant at Eastgate in Weardale, County Durham, UK. The company had already successfully extracted lithium carbonate from geothermal brine at the site, confirming the viability of the resource. The application for the pilot plant follows over 3 years of work in the area including trialling of multiple Direct Lithium Extraction (‘DLE’) technologies to find the optimal way to extract lithium from the geothermal groundwaters.
Lithium extraction remains one of the most interesting alternative revenue generation options for geothermal projects. Similar projects have become fairly advanced in Germany and the US, while early efforts are already underway in Italy, France, and Australia. Currently, commercial-scale lithium production from geothermal brine is yet to be realized but there is clearly plenty of interest in this topic.
![](
With AI being one of the major buzzwords of the past year, it was inevitable that one of our articles mentioning AI would also be one of the top ten stories of the year. This particular story involves Indonesian geothermal developer and operator Star Energy Geothermal partnering with IT company Kyndryl for a project that aims to use AI to optimize
Technology based on rapid collection and processing of high volumes of data are already being employed in geothermal projects worldwide, whether in exploration, drilling, or power plant operations. Notable examples are the use of IoT technology in Indonesia and Kenya, machine learning for drilling in New Zealand, and AI-led geothermal exploration being pioneered by Zanskar.
![](
There were lots of news stories on acquisitions in the past year, but one particular story resonated the most – the acquisition of the Lightning Dock geothermal power plant in Hidalgo County, New Mexico by Zanskar Geothermal & Minerals from previous owner Cyrq Energy.
Why was this story particularly interesting? Part of the intrigue is the growth of Zanskar that came with the acquisition. The company, previously known as a provider of exploration and subsurface characterization services, transitioned into a geothermal power plant operator. The power plant also complements their classical expertise, providing a facility for development and testing of new subsurface technologies.
It bears mentioning that ThinkGeoEnergy broke the news of this acquisition, and we would like to express our gratitude to Zanskar for trusting us!
![](
It has been an absolute delight keeping an eye on the geothermal progress of Kenya in the recent year. Aside from the continued growth of Olkaria, we are particularly excited to see the completion of the Phase 1 development of the Menengai geothermal field. This story on the credit investment of the Development Bank of South Africa on the 35-MW development of Sosian Energy in Menengai is another positive step towards this goal.
With construction work ongoing on two geothermal power plants in Menengai, we are likely only a few months away from Kenya joining the much-coveted 1 GW club for installed geothermal power capacity. Yet, the country is only getting started and we expect to see plenty more geothermal power facilities to be completed in the coming years.
![](
There are a few things that stood out in this story about Energy Development Corporation expanding the installed power capacity at the Southern Negros geothermal field. The first is the amount being allocated for it – it is a huge amount that will cover the drilling of new wells, construction of new well pads and surface facilities, and will even support the development of emerging technologies.
Operating since the early 1980s, the scale of the Southern Negros geothermal field is already quite impressive. Its steam field can support up to 241 MW of capacity from 92 wells. The fact that expansion is still being eyed for it is a testament to the resilience and sustainability of operating geothermal fields.
![](
The project being undertaken by Karsan Ramji and Sons Ltd’s with Steam Srl as Owner’s Engineer is unique and novel in several ways. For starters, it will be the first direct-use application of geothermal heat in cement manufacturing. There will also be a 4-MW captive geothermal power plant to supply the power requirement of the manufacturing facility.
Such a project expands the horizon of how geothermal energy can be utilized, particularly in hard-to-abate industries like cement manufacturing. This is also an excellent examples of how markets can be created for geothermal, attracting further investment and facilitating development.
![](
Data, especially subsurface data, is invaluable when it comes to geothermal prospecting. If there’s a way to access this data quickly and inexpensively, then that makes the whole project development process a lot more accessible. This article on a study done by researchers at the Stanford University that resulted in a temperature-at-depth model for the continental United States resonated with this need for easily accessible, high-quality data.
The good news about the US is that there is already a wealth of subsurface data from different sources. This new model gathers all this data and processes them using neural networks, allowing for reasonable prediction of critical subsurface parameters. Similar efforts are being done as well in other parts of the world.
![](
Emerging regions always make for very good stories to follow and report on. India has had excellent progress in the past year, with drilling continuing at the Ladakh site and detailed studies being done in the Arunachal Pradesh region. This particular project aims to evaluate the different direct-use applications of geothermal heat and is being done with technical assistance from Norwegian and Iceland partners.
We are of course not oblivious to the geopolitical significance of the Arunachal Pradesh region, which has likely drawn more interest towards this story. We hope that such conflicts get resolved quickly and peacefully, and that geothermal development becomes a tool for community empowerment and economic growth.
![](
As one of the pioneers in geothermal power generation, the expertise of New Zealand in the field of geothermal is globally recognized and admired. While the country’s geothermal power sector continues to grow, it is also working on more direct applications of geothermal, particularly for process heat in the Bay of Plenty region. Process heat in this context refers to heat used for manufacturing and processing products, something that is still predominantly derived from coal and gas combustion.
Process heating has huge potential for geothermal, notably because there are many industrial processes that use low or medium-grade heat. Such facilities also provide jobs and contribute in building a local manufacturing sector, thus strengthening local and regional economies. Such studies exhibit that heating should not be overlooked in the geothermal conversation. It has tremendous potential, has a lower technical barrier to entry, can empower economies, and provides quality of life improvements to local communities.
![](
It’s hardly surprising to see the groundbreaking Eavor-Loop project in Geretsried, Germany at the top of the list. This update, published in March 2024, states that Eavor has drilled a total of 7000 meters measured depth at the project site, combining both the vertical and lateral sections. There have been a few updates reported since, notably reaching a total measured depth of 8000 meters by the end of 2024. The company is now expecting to generate geothermal power for the first time at the Geretsried site in 2025.
The Eavor project has had its fair share of critics, but one thing that cannot be denied is that the project and technology has managed to capture the public’s attention in a way that is quite rare in the geothermal industry. If proven viable, then this is a technology that can truly fulfill the promise of ‘geothermal anywhere.’ This is exactly what we aspire for in the geothermal industry, and we are eager to see the success of this project.

Drilling of a geothermal exploration well in the town of Durdevac in the Koprivnica-Krizevci County, Croatia will officially begin on Friday, 28 March 2025. This was announced by Ana Lazo, Director of Field Development and Geothermal Energy at
Some details about the planned geothermal drilling campaign in Durdevac were announced earlier this year. The plan is to drill a total of eight wells to confirm the potential of geothermal in the region that were first indicated by studies 30 years ago. The well in Durdevac will be drilled as part of the exploration campaign for the Lescan license.
The project is notable for having secured a geothermal exploitation license relatively quickly, which hastened the preparatory work needed to start drilling. “We received the license for geothermal water exploration in October 2023 and in less than a year we managed to complete all preparatory activities and start construction work on our first well,”“In addition, we have also completed preparatory work for two more locations that will be tested one after the other in case the geothermal potential of the Lescan well is confirmed.”
Jadranka Lesko, Head of the Oil and Geothermal Water Sector at the Ministry of Economy, explained that a geothermal exploitation license can be obtained in only two months, given that applications are done satisfactorily. “The slowness of the state administration is often mentioned by those who submit very poor quality documentation, which is why verification can take longer than 12 months,”
Further funding support
Ljiljana Zornjak of the Croatian Hydrocarbon Agency acknowledged that the payback period for geothermal projects is quite long, and there is an inherently higher investment risk. For this reason, the Agency has launched a project that aims to integrate geothermal into the district heating systems of four Croatian cities.
Lovre Karamarko of the Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds also reports that four geothermal projects are set to receive funding from the Energy and Climate Change program. An example of this fund advancing geothermal in Croatia is the drilling of the Veliko Koronevo well in Bjelovar, which was completed in 2024.
“We are now in the negotiation phase with donor countries Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein, which will finance future investments in the program,”

#### Nevada Basalt
In Nevada the key area of interest for Ignis Energy is a basalt intrusion within the company’s lease, which signals volcanic activity and indicates elevated geothermal gradients. The region’s proximity to the range front suggests likely fracturing, a positive sign for geothermal productivity. Additionally, the presence of metamorphic core complexes at one of the project sites supports the potential for elevated temperatures and permeability—critical components for a successful geothermal system.

Ignis Energy has indicated initial plans to conduct comprehensive surveys in the prospect area. Methods will include such as Magnetotelluric and gravity surveys, along with shallow temperature measurements and seismic assessments to accurately evaluate subsurface potential.
The company aims to tap into the vast conventional geothermal resources found across Nevada’s Basin and Range region while remaining open to testing new technologies as they reach commercial maturity. This comprehensive approach to geothermal development emphasizes sustainability and innovation.
#### Clear Lake Volcanic Field
Ignis Energy has also secured a significant lease position in in Northern California’s Clear Lake Volcanic Field (CLVF). This is a prominent location for geothermal energy, already with two proven geothermal sites, including The Geysers, the largest developed geothermal field in the world. Preliminary data suggests that the site hosts a high-temperature, liquid-dominated geothermal resource, with a potential capacity of 60-120 MW.
The CLVF is a region is marked by an unusually high heat flow, making it a prime target for geothermal development. Typical geothermal gradients in the area range from 4-6 °F per 100 feet, but certain structural zones experience significantly higher temperatures, with gradients reaching 10-30°F per 100 feet—ideal conditions for geothermal energy production.
Surface indicators such as gas seepages, thermal water, and hydrothermal mineral deposits, along with past temperature readings as high as 525 °F (274 °C) in an offset well, further support the site’s geothermal potential. Future exploration efforts, including advanced geophysical surveys and additional drilling, will help confirm the resource and move toward development. MT and gravity surveys are scheduled in the area for Q1 2025.

The Bureau of Land Management has finalized a new categorical exclusion that eases permitting for geothermal exploration drilling and resource testing.

The
As originally proposed by the BLM on October 2024, the categorical exclusion eliminates the redundancy of having to conduct two separate environmental reviews for initial exploration drilling and to fully test the geothermal resource. This is depsite the two activities having similar environmental impacts.
The new categorical exclusion applies to geothermal resource confirmation operations plan of up to 20 acres, which can include drilling wells (e.g., core drilling, temperature gradient wells, and/or resource wells) to confirm the existence of a geothermal resource, to improve injection support, or to demonstrate connections between wells. It applies only to geothermal resource confirmation operations on public lands and split estates.
This development will help accelerate the discovery of new geothermal resources throughout the West, especially in states like Nevada, home to some of the largest undeveloped geothermal potential in the country.
More details on the approved categorical exclusion can be found at the
#### Proposal to ease geothermal resource exploration
The BLM has
* Does not include the direct testing of geothermal resources or resource utilization;
* Does not exceed 10 acres of total (contiguous or noncontiguous) surface disturbance;
* Requires reclamation of surface disturbances when their intended purpose has been fulfilled;
* Requires reclamation of temporary routes when their intended purpose(s) has been fulfilled, unless through a separate review and decision-making process the BLM incorporates and appropriately designates the route as part of its transportation system;
* Does not make a temporary route available for public use unless the temporary route is specifically intended to accommodate public use;
* Requires temporary routes to be constructed or used so as to allow for the reclamation, by artificial or natural means, of vegetative cover on the temporary route and areas where the vegetative cover was disturbed by the construction or use of the route, and requires such treatment to be designed to reestablish vegetative cover as soon as possible, but at most within 10 years after approved reclamation commences; and,
* Includes design elements to protect resources and resource uses consistent with the applicable Resource Management Plan, laws, regulations, and any lease terms (as applicable).
The BLM proposes that such activities normally would not have a significant effect on the environment as evaluated from similar previously implemented actions. The BLM’s intent in establishing this CX is to improve the efficiency of routine environmental review processes for pre-leasing geothermal resource exploration operations.

On January 3, 2025, the Chilean Ministry of Energy has issued two geothermal exploration licenses to Transmark Chile SpA (Chilean subsidiary of Dutch renewable energy company Transmark).
The concessions are located in the Andean region, an area recognized for its geothermal potential due to Chile’s position along the tectonically active Pacific Ring of Fire.
The addition of these two concessions builds on the country’s existing geothermal framework, which already includes eight exploitation concessions. These concession are three concessions held by Geotermica del Norte in the province of El Loa in Antofagasta, two concessions held by Compania de Energia Limitada Enerco and Compania de Energia in Talca-Linares in Del Maule, one concession held by Energia Andina in Chochagua, O’Higgins, one concession held by Copmpania Minera Dona Ines de Collahuasi in Del Tamarugal-El Loa in Tarapaca-Antofagasta, and one concession held by Transmark Chile in Biobio-Malleco, Biobio Araucania.
The concessions issued on January 3, 2025 are:
* Azufres (13,000 hectares), Colchagua province, O’Higgins Region (VI)
* Cordillera (6,000 hectares), Colchagua province, O’Higgins Region (VI)
The issuance of the license is expected to pave the way for detailed studies to verify the geothermal energy capacity of the area. Such projects are vital for exploring the feasibility of sustainable energy production and could contribute to Chile’s broader efforts to decarbonize its energy sector.
Geothermal energy is a key component of Chile’s renewable energy strategy. With its ability to provide reliable, baseload power, it complements intermittent renewable sources like solar and wind. The Ministry of Energy highlights geothermal as an underutilized resource with significant potential to bolster Chile’s decarbonization goals.
So far only one geothermal plant is operating in the country, the Cerro Pabellon geothermal power plant with two units and a combined power generation capacity of 81 MW.

A web-based tool under development by several partners will provide information on transitioning to geothermal heating to greenhouse growers in New Zealand.
![](

A new web-based tool is currently being developed to help greenhouse growers in New Zealand understand and evaluate the potential to transition to geothermal heating. The tool is expected to be ready by March 2026.
The project is being supported by the
The future online mapping and information tool will draw on existing data and knowledge about low-temperature geothermal resource availability in the greater Auckland, Northern Waikato, and Bay of Plenty regions, and how to use it to for temperature control of covered crop operations. This will provide growers with accessible and understandable information on geothermal potential when considering heat energy decarbonization options.
The project team will deliver:
* A subsurface mapping tool
* Economic feasibility insights
* Increased awareness of geothermal energy
“The use of geothermal heat in greenhouses is common overseas but not in New Zealand, which is ironic given how obvious this form of energy is in parts of the country like Rotorua,”
Energy costs currently account for about 30-40% of a the overhead costs of greenhouse growers. Reliance on fossil fuels also makes them vulnerable to rising gas prices, Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) costs, and supply disruptions. Geothermal energy offers a reliable, cost-effective alternative that strengthen food security while helping New Zealand align with international trends in geothermal adoption for greenhouse horticulture.
In early 2024, John Burnell of GNS Science mentioned that more than 90% of the tomatoes, capsicum, and cucumbers commercially grown in New Zealand are grown as covered crops in about 310 hectares of greenhouses, mostly in the North Island. This was in the context of a five-year research plan undertaken by GNS Science that aims to identify and characterize geothermal resources for greenhouse agriculture in New Zealand.

Fraunhofer IEG will be implementing an industrial cooling pilot using geothermal storage at the site of industry partner Voltavision in Bochum, Germany.
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
A pilot project that provides industrial cooling using seasonal subsurface storage will be deployed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Energy Infrastructures and Geothermal Energy (
#### The MissElly project
The pilot is part of the “MissElly” project, which had a feasibility phase that ran until 2023 and was funded by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia using funds from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).The project aims to provide year-round cooling for laboratories and test benches for electrical power engineering using seasonal and short-term cold storage, thus reducing the reliance on conventional refrigeration technology.
“We are designing a geothermal probe cold storage system and operating it so dynamically that it can absorb thermal energy over a wide power range and at speeds that meet demand,”“The smart control system and flexible system design are probably unique in the world.”
Stationary refrigeration technology accounts for almost 15% of total electricity consumption in Germany. The greatest demand here is for air conditioning, industrial refrigeration systems, and supermarket refrigeration systems. With a share of 95%, cooling is provided almost exclusively by electrically operated air conditioning and refrigeration technologies.
The aim of the project is ultimately to demonstrate a viable path to a significant reduction in energy consumption in the provision of cooling and thus to reduce the emissions of climate-damaging greenhouse gases directly from energy consumption and indirectly through refrigerant leaks by around 50% compared to conventional systems.
#### Industrial cooling using underground storage
The industrial partner in the project is Voltavision and operates particularly energy-efficient test laboratories, develops test bench equipment and tests battery cells and modules as well as high-voltage batteries for the automotive industry, for example, at its site in Bochum.
During testing, high heat loads can also occur on the test systems for a short time. Cooling this process heat to around 20 °C requires a large part of the company’s energy expenditure. The process heat is released into the surrounding air via a cooling water circuit, chillers and recoolers on the roof. This generally has disadvantages: the system itself is associated with high investment costs when purchasing it, and ongoing operation involves high electricity consumption due to the compression cooling.
“When the outside temperature is low, the cooling water of the systems is already cooled by the ambient cold in the air. This free cooling is not possible on very warm days, so power-intensive compression cooling must be used,”
“In order to increase the free cooling share to up to 100 percent, knowing that summers are getting hotter, the idea arose to use cold stored in the ground from winter in summer. After the promising feasibility study, we are very pleased to now be implementing the project together with Fraunhofer IEG at our location in the Bochum Technology Quarter.”

#### The pilot project
The MissEllyDEMO project will be the first to use a field of geothermal probes as storage for an industrial application with a permanent need for process cooling. Between 30 to 40 probes will be laid at intervals of 5 to 10 meters and up to 100 meters deep. A brine will circulate as the operating medium in the closed pipe loops, absorbing the process heat to be dissipated into the subsoil. The smart and predictive operating control will regulate how the probes are connected on a daily basis, for example in parallel, in series or in certain zones, in order to ensure optimal heat transfer during predictive charging and discharging.
The free and otherwise unused cooling capacity of the cooling towers is used to regenerate the cold reservoir. These therefore run not only for a few hours a day during peak load times, but continuously whenever the outside air temperature drops low enough.
In addition, the probe field designed by Fraunhofer IEG can also be “charged” with cold from the night and winter by lowering the temperatures underground, which are usually between 11 °C and 13 °C, to temperatures just above freezing. This means that Voltavision’s test systems always have enough sustainable cold available.
This prototype is intended to show how the dynamics of free, regenerative but volatile environmental cooling can be sensibly integrated into a real economic process. “With our geothermal probe storage facility, we are creating a cooling supply system for industry that meets the high requirements for security of supply and flexibility through the use of a seasonal cold storage facility, the introduction of environmental cooling and the operational optimization of cooling systems in the overall system,”
The operational experience will also provide the development paths for expansion to other processes and other users. For this purpose, Fraunhofer IEG will create a digital twin of the system which provides scientific monitoring and planning for operational and design optimization.

A new study by Spain's IGME proposes a management methodology that aims for more sustainable utilization of shallow geothermal energy resources.

A new study by the shallow geothermal energy resources. The method was applied to 24 shallow groundwater heat pump (GWHP) systems in five European cities.
The full paper by Martinez-Leon et al, “Novel management strategies for optimizing shallow geothermal energy exploitation: A European urban experience perspective,”Renewable Energy
The participation of the Geological Survey of Slovenia, the British Geological Survey, the Technical University of Munich. and the University of Basel allowed for the methodology to be applied in different shallow geothermal installations across Europe.
The management strategy is based on two alternatives proposed by the study :
* Prioritizing higher flowrates over lower temperature changes
* Prioritizing higher temperature changes over low flowrates
The optimization methodology is proposed with the aim of reducing the thermal impact of GWHP systems on urban aquifers. The figure below schematically shows the steps for optimization:
![]( of the flow rate (Q) and discharge temperature (DT) optimization. (adapted from Martinez Leon et al, 2025)
Three types of optimizations were proposed based on the intended use of the GWHP system with appropriate systems identified – cooling mode (Basel, Munich), heating mode (Ljubjana, Cardiff, Basel), or dual mode (Zaragoza).
The analysis of the data shows two important conclusions:
* Increasing the flow rate and reducing temperature changes resulted in an average reduction of 1.48 °C in the discharge temperature across all GWHP systems
* increasing the temperature changes while reducing the flow rates led to a reduction of the flow rates of all GWHP systems to an average 8.09 L s?1
In either case, the method allows for the optimal utilization of shallow geothermal resources without significantly compromising the energy supply. The method is particularly effective for regulating thermal discharges from GWHP systems where well relocation is not feasible due to spatial or economic constraints.

An agreement has been signed between
According to the signed agreement, both parties establish the basic directions and a plan of cooperation regarding the construction of a low-temperature geothermal energy installation in the mine. The project is expected to be completed by the 3rd quarter of 2026.
The heat pump installation will be located in a building on the premises leased from the Myslowice-Wesola Mine. This location was selected due to its proximity to both the underground water pipelines and the heating network, as well as having the space for the construction of the installation.
The system will extract water at 25 °C from a depth of 655 meters. A working medium will absorb the heat from the mine water, which will then go through a heat pump to increase its temperature and pressure.
“PGG’s activities are guided by the idea of corporate social responsibility, hence the conclusion of cooperation, which is a pioneering solution in the company’s structures. Sharing our resources in this way is in line with the implementation of the assumptions of the European green transformation and is very important for our company, thanks to which we could significantly reduce the demand for energy, which would have to be generated from other sources,”
“The construction of this installation in the Myslowice-Wesola mine is in line with Dalkia Polska Energia’s strategy, which aims to reduce emissions and phase out coal in heat production by 2029. The most ecological energy is the one that is not wasted, which is why the use of waste heat or heat from renewable sources should become more and more common. Our company wants to promote and use this solution to be able to provide its customers with heat with the lowest possible carbon footprint,”
A similar mine water heating scheme is operational at Gateshead, UK, which is currently one of the largest mine water heat networks in Europe.

A 3D seismic survey to explore for geothermal resources in Zalaegerszeg in the Zala County of Hungary is is set to be completed. With this, the city has made significant progress in establishing the potential for geothermal utilization particularly in the northern areas, bordered by the settlements of Nagykutas, Hottó, Zalaegerszeg, and Zalaszentlorinc.
Seismic measurements started in the first week of March 2025. A total of 3500 geophones were used, spaced 300 meters apart, to cover a survey area of 36 square kilometers. During the research, the sensors recorded the seismic vibration waves generated by vibro trucks. The project was executed by the Geological Service of the
Based on the data obtained, a 3D model of the subsurface will be generated which will provide an indicative picture of the underground layers and their usability. The measurement covers the ZalaZone and Rheinmetal sites, as well as the agricultural areas in the outskirts.
At the project closing press conference, Dr. László Nagy, President of the Hungarian State Geological Survey, spoke about how the Authority has recently transformed the regulatory environment to make the implementation of geothermal projects more flexible. He mentioned that new regulations have come into effect in March 2023, which aimed to create efficient and fast administration.
He also highlighted that the results are already encouraging: in two years, more than 120 exploration permit applications have been received, 75 of which have already been approved, and the first utilization contract has even been concluded in Budapest.
In 2024, Hungary published a National Geothermal Strategy that outlines a path for the greater utilization of geothermal energy, setting a target to double geothermal energy output to 12 to 13 PJ by 2030.

Preparatory work is currently ongoing for the planned drilling site for a geothermal heating project in Vaterstetten, Germany. A tender for the drilling work is expected to be announced in June 2025, looking towards a start of drilling in spring 2026. If successful, the four municipalities involved in the project can be supplied with geothermal by the second half of 2027.
The wells to be drilled in Vaterstetten will provide the supply for the inter-municipal geothermal heating project of Geo Energie München Ost (GEMO), a joint development company of the municipalities of Vaterstetten, Grasbrunn, Haar, and Zorneding. The company was founded in December 2023.
Early excavation work at the drilling site was done in February 2024 to search for potential archaeological artifacts. None were found, and the green light was given for further preparatory work on the drilling site.
Tobias Aschwer, Vaterstetten’s environmental director and one of the two managing directors of GEMO, explained that the topsoil at the drilling site will be removed this spring. This cannot be done earlier due to the bird breeding season.
An EIA document filed by GEMO in February 2024 indicated a plan to drill up to four geothermal boreholes to depths of approximately 3268 meters (TVD) in the Parsdorf district of Vaterstetten.
A report presented in 2023 states that the possible geothermal reservoir in the area hosts water at 95 °C and a potential thermal output of 21 MWth. This will be enough to supply the district heating networks of all four municipalities. Nevertheless, GEMO is negotiating an exploration insurance policy.
Josef Mittermeier (SPD) noted that the federal government has committed EUR 18.5 million in funding for the project. The drilling alone is expected to require EUR 15 million.

The GeoGrid project, focused on exploring the potential of geothermal energy for decarbonisation in the UK, has been awarded GBP 480,000 through Ofgem’s Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF). The project brings together Geosolutions Leeds, Northern Powergrid, LCP Delta, E.ON Next, Leeds City Council, and Star Refrigeration to tackle key challenges in the energy transition.
Using the University of Leeds’ Geothermal Campus living lab, GeoGrid aims to investigate how long-term thermal energy storage can improve the energy system’s efficiency and sustainability. With the UK’s heating and transport systems increasingly electrified, thermal energy storage is seen as a flexible solution to address rising electricity demands, inefficiencies in renewable energy use, and escalating costs.
By integrating geothermal storage into the energy system, GeoGrid will explore ways to lower connection costs, reduce expensive infrastructure upgrades, and enhance grid resilience. The project also seeks to demonstrate how the interaction of geothermal systems with energy markets can strengthen the business case for district heating.
Dr. Emma Bramham, Lecturer in Applied Geophysics at the University of Leeds and GeoGrid’s Project Lead, emphasized the project’s innovative approach:
“This collaboration will explore new ways of improving energy efficiency using the University’s Geothermal Living Lab facilities. Storing excess renewable energy beneath the city could help the UK make better use of green electricity and accelerate the transition to net zero.”
Steve Newall, Innovation Manager at Northern Powergrid, highlighted the project’s practical focus, stating, “More accurate demand estimations will make flexible energy use more feasible, expand electrical capacity, and reduce decarbonisation costs. We are now moving into the ‘Demonstrate and Deploy’ stage, where the benefits are becoming more tangible.”
GeoGrid reflects a broader effort to develop scalable solutions for decarbonisation while addressing challenges like affordability and energy system resilience. The project serves as a significant step in understanding how geothermal energy can support the UK’s net-zero goals.

#### New financing opportunities for geothermal energy
Geothermal energy plays a crucial role in Türkiye’s renewable energy sector, contributing to energy security, carbon emission reduction, and sustainable growth. Supporting geothermal investments through such financial models could be essential in achieving these goals. Given TSKB’s past financial support for renewable energy projects, this new loan agreement is expected to create funding opportunities for geothermal power plant investments.
TSKB General Manager Murat Bilgiç highlighted that the loan diversifies sustainable finance resources and contributes to Türkiye’s green transition goals. OPEC Fund President Abdulhamid Alkhalifa emphasized that this partnership represents a significant step toward Türkiye’s 2053 net-zero targets.
This financing could improve access to capital for the Turkish geothermal sector, particularly in promoting low-carbon energy sources in the fight against climate change. As TSKB’s geothermal investment support becomes clearer in the coming period, industry players will gain a better understanding of how to benefit from such funds.

The drilling work for the geothermal energy system in the town of Garges-lès-Gonesse in the Val-d’Oise department of northern Paris, also part of the Île-de-France region. The drilling work will last three months and the geothermal system is expected to be commissioned by Fall of this year.
Drilling operations were officially inaugurated in the presence of Benoît Jimenez, Mayor of Garges-lès-Gonesse and Regional Councilor of Île-de-France, Philippe Court, Prefect of Val-d’Oise, Amélie Renaud, Regional Director of ADEME Île-de-France, Olivier Blond, Special Delegate for Environmental Health and the Fight Against Air Pollution for the Île-de-France ergion, and Yves Lederer, President of the
The cost of the project is EUR 65 million. ADEME has supported the project with EUR 25 million while the Île-de-France region has contributed another EUR 3 million.
The well is expected to tap into a geothermal resource hosted in the Dogger formation, with an expected temperature of 65 °C at a depth of 1600 meters. The drilling work will be done in two phases – from mid-March to early June, and from the end of June until the end of July.

Educational facilities have also been set up to welcome children from the town’s primary schools, residents, and local stakeholders to learn how the heating network and geothermal energy operates safely. Visits can also be organized by registration on the website of
The 19.6-kilometer heating network will soon be supplied by a combination of geothermal energy and a wastewater treatment plant. Heat will be produced locally using geothermal energy (62%) and the recovery of waste heat from the SIAH wastewater treatment plant located in Bonneuil-en-France (35%). Biogas will then be used as supplement (3%).
With the heat network operating, the town of Garges-lès-Gonesse will avoid annual emissions of up to 20,000 tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 16,667 vehicles.
* Taken over operations of the network in the Dame Blanche Nord district;
* Created 9.1 kilometers of network, now supplying the equivalent of 4800 homes, including sports facilities and schools;
* Built a 1000-square meter building on Rue Denis Papin to house the technical equipment to support the network, such as heat pumps and heat exchangers
Earlier this year, the Coriance Group had also started drilling operations for a geothermal doublet in the Alfortville commune, also within the Paris suburbs.

The International Energy Agency has published the Future of Geothermal Energy report, highlighting the potential of the sector and key enablers for its growth.

The
“The Future of Geothermal”
The report finds that there is potential for the deployment of up to 800 GW of geothermal capacity worldwide, accounting for 15% of the global electricity demand growth between now and 2050. This number currently only stands at 1%, highlighting the challenges of the sector but also its immense growth potential.
The report places a special highlight on “next-generation” geothermal technologies such as Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) and closed-loop Advanced Geothermal Systems (AGS). Such technologies can greatly expand the geographical scope of where geothermal power and heating can be developed. However, early- and growth-stage investment remains a key enabler in allowing these technologies to achieve economies of scale and become cost-competitive.
The report also goes into the role of the oil and gas industry in providing the expertise and technology for the wider deployment of geothermal technologies and reducing the cost of geothermal development. Moreover, diversifying into geothermal also helps oil and gas companies and professionals by providing new business opportunities should there be a decline in oil and gas demand in the future.
The lack of policy support in many territories is cited by the report as one of the major gaps in geothermal development. While more than 100 countries have policies to support solar PV and/or onshore wind, less than 30 countries have implemented policies specifically for geothermal. In this context, the report makes a number of policy recommendations that can help increase the visibility of geothermal, attract more investment, and mitigate the risks of geothermal development with faster permitting and financial schemes.

Studies done for the report benefitted from the outcomes and discussions of a “Future of Geothermal Energy” workshop held by the IEA earlier this year with more than 100 public and private stakeholders from around the world.

The results of the study and prospects for a pilot project will be presented to the community at an open day event scheduled on the 7th of November 2024.
The feasibility study was made possible by a £36,000 UK Shared Prosperity Fund grant from North Yorkshire Council to the
The UK Shared Prosperity Fund, which provides £2.6 billion for local investment until March 2025, aims to foster community pride, boost local economies, and improve life chances across the UK by investing in infrastructure, businesses, and skills development.
Aside from quantifying the potential benefits of geothermal heating within the initial scope of the project, the study also identified other potential networks in the town that could offer further financial and environmental gains. The proposed solution involves closed-loop geothermal wells drilled to depths of up to 1800 meters, reaching temperatures exceeding 45 °C.
“We’ve identified several viable geothermal heat networks in Pickering that could significantly reduce energy costs and carbon emissions. Engaging with the community has been a crucial part of this project, and we look forward to sharing more details and answering questions at the open day on November 7th,”
“This project presents an exciting alternative to fossil fuels with the opportunity to develop new net zero infrastructure while repurposing legacy assets for sustainable and renewable energy use. Not only can we reduce costs and carbon emissions, but we also strengthen the town’s energy security, protecting residents from potential future energy price fluctuations. If successful, this could have massive implications nationally,”

![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 8 Nov 2024
Up to three geothermal wells for heating will be drilled at the site of the Laakso Joint Hospital in Finland starting spring 2025.
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
The target depth for the wells will be 3000 to 35000 meters. In addition to the drilling work, the contractor will deliver the well design, test runs, and training for the client’s representatives. The total value of the agreement is EUR 14.5 million, of which the first well accounts for EUR 5.9 million and the next two wells for EUR 4.3 million each.
Hanjin D&B will drill the geothermal well using its water hammer drilling technology. The wells will be located next to the hospital area at Laakso’s field. Heat from the wells will be led to the hospital’s technical facilities, where the necessary equipment, including heat pumps and exchangers are located. This equipment will transfer the geothermal heat to the hospital’s local district heating.
For a long time, the Laakso Joint Hospital project has studied a variety of possibilities to use geothermal energy as part of the hospital’s heat production. The aim was to find the most ecological way to drill hard granite safely and to prevent the gaps and cracks on the rock surface from being filled with drilling sludge.
The water hammer drilling technology developed by South Korean Hanjin D&B is particularly suitable for this purpose. Once successfully completed, it will be one of the deepest geothermal wells to have been drilled in Finland to date, and the deepest drilled with a water hammer technology in Europe.
“Geothermal wells are ideal for a densely built city — a deep well doesn’t take up space and it generates an unsurpassed amount of local environmentally friendly energy compared to commonly used geothermal heating. As with any new technology, it does involve risks, of course, with regard to issues such as bedrock quality at great depths and the heat production capacity of the completed well. These risks will be managed under the agreement,”
“The benefits of the project, if implemented successfully, will be so significant that both owners of the Laakso Joint Hospital project — the City of Helsinki and HUS — are ready to back it.”
The Laakso Hospital area is being rebuilt by the City of Helsinki and the HUS. The area will be built up in phases from 2022 to 2030.

Seismic surveys in Poznan, Poland will assess geothermal potential for district heating, marking a key step toward cleaner energy for the city.
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
The city of Poznan in the western part of Poland is taking a major step toward geothermal district heating, as seismic surveys were started on March 11, 2025 to assess the city’s subsurface potential. The initiative is led by Danish geothermal developer Innargi and MOU between Innargi and Veolia Energia.
Seismic surveys to map geothermal potential
The surveys will cover 60 kilometers across central and southern Poznan, using specialized trucks to send low-frequency vibrations into the ground. These vibrations, recorded by geophones, will help create a detailed geological map to confirm geothermal water availability.
“The surveys will give us a better understanding of the hot water reservoirs beneath Poznan, allowing us to plan the project more effectively,”
Geothermal: a key part of Poznan’s energy transition
The geothermal initiative aligns with Poznan’s goal to decarbonize district heating by 2030, reducing reliance on coal. If successful, geothermal energy could provide up to 20% of the city’s heating needs, with integration planned by 2029.
“Our strategic goal is to decarbonize Poznan‘s district heating system by 2030, i.e. to move away from the use of coal to generate heat and electricity. One of the projects to help us achieve this is the use of geothermal deposits for district heating in cooperation with our partner Innargi. Heat from inside the earth, which is a renewable energy source, has the potential to become part of our green energy mix. This is in line with our vision for the future of district heating, which goes hand in hand with the green future of the city and the continuous improvement of the environment and air quality.”
A Model for Sustainable Urban Heating
Poznan’s geothermal project could serve as a blueprint for other Polish cities, reinforcing the role of renewable heat sources in modern district heating networks.
With ongoing collaboration between Innargi, Veolia Energia Poznan, and the city, Poznan is moving closer to a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.

The call for applications for “Subsidies for Projects Promoting the Understanding of Geothermal Power Generation”
More details on the subsidy round and how to apply can be found
The purpose of this subsidy is to promote understanding of geothermal resource development among residents and others living in the vicinity of geothermal resource development sites. Projects to be subsidized are those that contribute to promoting understanding of geothermal resource development. These are to be carried out at sites where geothermal resource development is underway or is planned for the future with the aim of introducing geothermal power generation.
Activities that will be covered by the subsidy may include:
1. Study sessions and other events
* * Seminars and study sessions on geothermal resource development
* Visits to geothermal power generation facilities (in principle referring to domestic facilities)
* Management of meetings of stakeholders at geothermal resource development sites
* Preliminary survey and examination of hot water utilization projects
The target locations for this subsidy are those where geothermal resource development is underway with a target output of 1000 kW or more, or where geothermal resource development is planned for the future.
2. Hot spring impact survey project
This will cover drilling for hot spring resources in the event that natural hot spring water discharge is excessively reduced for some reason after the geothermal resource development has advanced. The target for this subsidy are locations where geothermal resource development is underway with a target output of 5000 kW or more, or where there are existing power plants with an output of 5000 kW or more.

The company had acquired the Kaynarpinar license back in 2023, with a positive disposition on its geothermal potential as the area lies at the intersection of two of Türkiye’s largest fault zones. Previous geochemical and geophysical studies had also been done at the site, including a shallow drilling.
With this achievement, Ignis H2 Energy strengthen its position in the geothermal sector of Türkiye, where it has managed to develop Alaska, Nevada, California, and Italy.
Ignis Energy has published on-site footage of the well completion process on their LinkedIn page.

Geosciences play a crucial role in exploration, production, and monitoring of geothermal energy. Ongoing geothermal projects exploiting geoscience technologies for geothermal energy applications have posed many scientific questions that need answers from both academic and industrial perspectives. This workshop focuses on geoscience technologies applied to all types of geothermal energy (e.g., direct use, hydrothermal, enhanced geothermal systems, and superhot geothermal system) for resource exploration, reservoir characterization, and monitoring.
The event’s keynote speakers will include:
* Aubry DeReuil, Head of Exploration at Zanskar Geothermal & Minerals
* Steven Fercho, Exploration Geoscience Lead at Fervo Energy
* Joseph Moore, Managing Principal Investigator at Utah FORGE
There will also be field trip to a variety of surface manifestations, historically significant geothermal sites, and producing geothermal systems in Utah. Particularly notable are visits to electricity producing binary and flash plants in central Utah, and Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) being developed by Utah FORGE and Fervo.

A slim majority vote from the city council has seemingly ended aspirations for a geothermal heating project in Bad Bevensen in Lower Saxony, Germany.

With a narrow majority vote of 13-12, the city council of Bad Bevensen in Lower Saxony, Germany has voted against the continuation of the planned geothermal heating project. The negative votes argued that the EUR 29 million cost of the project is too high for the city, considering that profits are only expected after 20 years.
This disheartening result comes as a surprise for a project that has built seemingly positive momentum through the last years. In 2023, Bad Bevensen was one of two municipalities that had been selected by the State of Lower Saxony to receive a conditionally repayable grant for a geothermal pilot project. In 2024, a new company was founded to lead the geothermal development efforts, called Renewable Energies Bad Bevensen GmbH (Erneuerbare Energien Bad Bevensen GmbH).
With this decision, the company must now go through a liquidation process.
Seismic surveys for the project were planned in 2025 in anticipation of test drilling. However, this had not yet been commissioned.
“It was a difficult decision and I want to reiterate that we are fundamentally in favor of geothermal energy. Just not under these circumstances. We are now satisfied,”
“We evaluated and discussed the project for a long time. Now a project worth millions has been averted,”
#### Counter-proposal also rejected
A proposal was presented during the discussion that will help decrease the financial burden and risk for the city. This would involve two investors potentially joining the project, taking over 49% of the company. City Director Martin Feller said that there was no signature yet from these potential investors, but there was a firm commitment to participate.
However, the proposal did not change the position of the CDU and the FDP/Großmann group on the project.
“[This is because] two potential investors (including an expert energy supplier) recently expressed their willingness to join the company and promised a complete heat supply for the entire town. However, they need several months to make a final commitment to review the data already available and the funding options,”
The SPD and the Greens are still campaigning for the project to continue, even under the terms of the compromise proposal. “If we back out now, we will deprive citizens of the opportunity to have a cheap energy supply,”
“But I don’t understand how you can jeopardize such a unique opportunity,”

Low injectivity is often experienced in geothermal doublets installed in sandstone reservoirs. This even led to a shutdown of the Mezoberény (Hungary) geothermal site. An on-site campaign was carried out at that site including a stimulation aiming to enhance the transmissivity of the sedimentary reservoir and the near-wellbore zone of this site.
Previous studies have concluded that insufficient injectivity may be linked to a high skin effect in the near well-bore zone and pore-clogging in combination with the low net sandstone content of the fluvio-deltaic reservoir. At other sites, chemical or biological activities are the reason for decreasing permeability during the operation of the geothermal plants. In Mezoberény a chemical soft stimulation based on the injection of hydrochloric acid (HCl) was successfully used to unclog and recover the well injectivity. Hence, it is possible to retrieve favorable conditions and operate sustainably.
With a focus on Mezoberény, several examples will be shown on the challenges and opportunities of using sedimentary reservoirs for geothermal energy production.
Dr Maren Brehme is a hydrogeologist aiming to understand subsurface fluid flow using multidisciplinary approaches for sustainable geothermal exploration and exploitation strategies with a strong focus on fieldwork and real-scale data. Maren’s main research objective is finding new well locations during geothermal exploration and field development and on optimizing sustainable geothermal energy extraction and conversion.
Areas of expertise are geothermal reservoir characterization, hydraulic, thermal and chemical data interpretation, enhancing reservoir performance and its sustainable use. Methods and findings are mainly related to geothermal systems but applicable in any geofluids environment (geothermal, CO2, H2, heat, drinking water).

Geothermal energy, historically used for heating, is now being adapted for cooling through technological advancements and service models like CAS. By harnessing the Earth’s stable subsurface temperatures, geothermal cooling provides a sustainable, cost-effective alternative to traditional cooling systems, significantly reducing carbon emissions and energy consumption.
Historically, expanding geothermal solutions has been challenging due to high capital expenditure and subsurface risks. Strataphy’s CAS model addresses these challenges by eliminating upfront costs while guaranteeing successful system installation and operation. Clients pay a monthly subscription fee based on system usage once operational, avoiding initial CAPEX and technical risks. This approach will accelerate the broader adoption of geothermal cooling.
Cooling demands can represent up to 70% of electricity consumption in buildings in certain climates, with a global annual market in the hundreds of billion annually and will exceed $40 billion annually in the gulf region alone by 2030. Expanding geothermal cooling solutions will reduce operational costs and CO2 emissions, driving sustainability and energy efficiency.
![]( picture as part of a field visit in the Northwest of Saudi Arabia. (source: Strataphy)

A Geothermal-Based Net Zero Building has been inaugurated at the city of Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh, India. An array of ten boreholes, drilled to a depth of 120 meters each, provides space air conditioning to the building, thus far being able to maintain indoor temperatures of 22 °C while the outdoor temperature is at 43 °C.
The building, designed and built for the Indian Army at CWE Jhansi, was built from the ground up to demonstrate the feasibility and benefit of net-zero technologies. The electricity supply of the building is primarily from photovoltaic panels, with a backup grid connection when solar power is not available. The ground source heat pump system is the only source of air conditioning.
The project was commissioned by the Military Engineering Service of the Indian Army, seeking to build a facility with an Energy Performance Index (EPI) of less than 50. For location, buildings in the city of Jhansi have a standard recommended EPI of 144. The building was designed and delivered by the large-scale geothermal heating and cooling system at the Leh Airport. The project took 138 days to complete.
Reports indicate that the Indian Army now intends to replicate this technology for facilities in higher altitudes.
_“This is a big success in India’s journey of Net Zero buildings , be it cooling or heating._ said Arijit Ghosh, Managing Director at S.A.P. Automations India.
“The Indian Army is a large consumer of space conditioning. Hence, I would think it’s a potential game-changer not just for the Army, but for India.”

A geothermal heating project in the city of Kosice in Slovakia will be receiving EUR 56.2 million the European Commission’s Just Transition Fund. The project aims for an installed thermal output of 30 MWt by July 2028, thus covering about a quarter of the total energy supply of the Kosice heating plant.
The contract for implementation of the “Utilization of geothermal energy in the Kosice Basin”
The project is expected to start by January 2025 and will have a duration of 43 months. GEOTERM KOSICE will start the drilling of 3 new geothermal wells to add to the three existing wells in the Svinica-Durkov geothermal center. Miroslav Kavul’a, CEO OF MH Teplarensky, stated that the project has been designed so that additional centers can be built alongside it in subsequent stages.
EU funding for the geothermal project had already been announced in late 2023, with the categorization of the project as a “national priority project.” However, this latest development officially sets the framework for project implementation.
This investment will help not just in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, but will also support job creation and the development of the local economy. In addition, the prices geothermal heating will be more stable for end consumers compared to heat from combustion of gas or coal.
Michal Kalinak, State Secretary of MIRRI SR, emphasized the importance of the geothermal project in positioning Slovakia in the geothermal industry of the EU. The official states that having a geothermal project puts Slovakia in a stronger position to apply for new EU funding, as the country seeks to have higher geothermal utilization than what it currently has.
I am pleased that in times when the debate about rising energy prices continues, we are bringing this concrete and strategic solution. I believe that the geothermal project in Kosice will also be an inspiration for other regions of Slovakia, because our country has a huge, but still insufficiently exploited, potential in this area,”

The funding was announced by Baroness Chapman, UK Minister for Latin America and the Caribbean, during her meeting with Grenada’s Prime Minister Hon. Dickon Mitchell. It will go towards assessing the viability of developing the geothermal resources of Grenada, including the drilling of exploration wells.
The geothermal resources of Grenada has the potential to displace up to 55% of the country’s total electricity generation from diesel. This will enhance Grenada’s energy security, provide a cleaner environment for the residents and result in lower electricity rates for businesses and citizens.
“I am thrilled to announce £10m in new funding, which is supporting Grenada’s efforts to reduce its resilience on fossil fuels and transition to a more sustainable, locally sourced energy future. The investment in geothermal energy will not only help to lower energy costs for households and businesses, but will also lead to lower carbon emissions, an essential step in tackling the climate crisis we all face,”
This is an important part of the UK government’s commitment to supporting the Caribbean region in its journey towards green energy adoption and climate resilience”.
While there had been sustained interest to develop geothermal in Grenada for the better part of the last decade, progress has so far been limited to
Prime Minister Mitchel expressed gratitude for the UK Government’s support: “We are grateful for the UK’s support in advancing our geothermal exploration project. This funding will allow us to assess the geothermal potential of Grenada and take further steps towards building a clean, sustainable and more affordable energy system for our country. We are excited about the possibilities that this project holds for our country’s future.”

Some of the stakeholders had published their opinions on the draft law and how it can be improved in the days leading up to this hearing.
#### Expansion of the scope needed
Many of the stakeholders indicated that the current scope of the draft law is insufficient in addressing many of the issues that the geothermal industry is still facing.
Gregor Dilger of the German Geothermal Association (
When preparing seismic measurements, the consent of individual property owners had to be obtained to allow the use of paths, for example. This currently creates a considerable amount of bureaucratic effort. This could be remedied with a general obligation to tolerate “such short-term and barely noticeable measures,”

State-owned electricity company
Interested participants may acquire the EoI form and NDA draft by registration through email to
The three sites considered under this invitation are as follows:
* WKP Tulehu (20 MW) – Central Maluku Regency, Maluku Province
* WKP Mt. Tangkuban Perahu (40 MW) – Subang, Bandung, and Purwakarta Regency, West Java Province
* WKP Mt. Ungaran (55 MW) – Semarang and Kendal Regency, Central Java Province
PLN, as the holder of geothermal working area licenses, commits to developing its Geothermal Working Areas (approximately 260 MW) assigned by the Government of Indonesia under Geothermal Law No. 21/ 2014. PLN has finished preparing detailed 3G Studies (Geology, Geochemistry, and Geophysics) for the Geothermal Working Areas. For Tulehu, 5 (five) exploration wells have been drilled by PLN.
The Participants may choose all, 1 (one), or 2 (two) of the Geothermal Working Areas.
The Participants may consist of either (i) a single entity or (ii) a Consortium.
#### Scope of work
The scope of the work for the project is briefly summarized below:
* The selected partner(s) through the project company will sign a Geothermal Exploration and Energy Conversion Agreement (GEECA) with PLN to carry out all the works related to the PLN Geothermal Working Areas, which include drilling activities, feasibility studies, construction of the plant, energy conversion, and operation and maintenance
* During the exploration period, PLN is responsible for obtaining permits, acquiring land, and constructing drilling infrastructure according to the design proposed by the project company.
* Meanwhile, the project company’s responsibilities include conducting studies, preparation works and executing the exploration drilling activities. Upon successful exploration of geothermal resources and confirmation of the project’s economic viability, the project will proceed with the involvement of both the selected partner(s) and a PLN Subsidiary.
* The selected partner(s), along with the PLN Subsidiary, will be responsible for operating and maintaining the Geothermal Steam Field Facility, handling the design, engineering, financing, construction, testing, commissioning, ownership, operation, and maintenance of the Geothermal Power Plant, with the obligation to transfer ownership to PLN eventually.
This invitation continues the partner selection process carried out previously using the Geothermal Exploration and Energy Conversion Agreement (GEECA) scheme. However, in this process, Participants will be able to conduct comprehensive studies in advance. PLN is open to adjusting the terms and conditions in the GEECA scheme by considering input from Participants, which is part of the studies’ integral aspect.
#### Summary of process
After registration, the Participants shall sign and submit an Expression of Interest (EoI) and a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). Once it is submitted, the GEECA Document and resource study data report (Data Room) will be shared. The participants then shall prepare and submit a proposal consisting of results analysis of technical data and preliminary study, gap analysis, plan for additional study, and input on the GEECA scheme. The proposal will be evaluated and intensively discussed with the Participants to conclude with the Joint Study Agreement.
The Partner(s) interested in doing the Joint Study will prepare and submit a Study Report consisting of a field/detail study, comprehensive and integrated analysis, exploration plan, development plan (may only apply for Tulehu), preliminary techno-economic study, and modification or input on the GEECA scheme.
Following the Study Report, the Partner Selection will be conducted with either a limited tender or direct appointment method, exclusive only to the Participant(s) completing and submitting the Study Report based on the Joint Study Agreement.
The milestone process for partner selection is generally illustrated here:

The
Fraunhofer IEG offers application-oriented research, development and advice on the relevant technologies, from integrated management of the subsurface to large-scale heat pumps and sector coupling of networks and storage.
“Switzerland has its climate goals firmly in sight and is consistently shaping its energy transition in a sustainable manner,”“We are delighted to be able to accompany Switzerland on its journey and to help ensure that the most promising geothermal projects are implemented and make a contribution to the energy transition.”
In Switzerland, deep geothermal energy is seen as a future-proof option for electricity and heat supply. Just a few months ago, the Federal Council of Switzerland voted in favor of an action plan and roadmap for the development of medium-depth geothermal energy. To support such initiatives, the BFE has set up corresponding funding opportunities for geothermal projects.
The experts at Fraunhofer IEG will be responsible for evaluating these funding applications and providing technical support for the funded projects for the BFE. These advisory tasks are limited to non-sovereign activities in the funding programs of the Federal Office of Energy in the field of deep geothermal energy. Fraunhofer IEG provides the technical assessments on the basis of which the Federal Office can make sovereign decisions and check that the funds are being used appropriately.
Fraunhofer IEG is advised in particular on the topics of plant engineering and sustainable management of reservoirs. It checks and evaluates the incoming project applications in accordance with the criteria set out in the CO2 Ordinance and the Swiss Energy Promotion Ordinance and documents these in reports to the Federal Office.
The Federal Office can now also obtain additional technical advice on the subject of deep geothermal energy within the framework of the “Expert Support for Geothermal Projects” agreement. The framework contract for consulting services runs for 5 years with the option of an extension of 3 years.

# GreenFire Energy – A scalable and flexible model for geothermal growth

![ ](

In this interview, Rob Klenner tells us about GreenFire Energy's transition to full-spectrum geothermal development and focus on behind-the-meter projects.
![](

One thing that often escapes mainstream discussion of geothermal is the fact that there are already several technological solutions that work. In many places around the world, technology is not the bottleneck for geothermal deployment. Rather, it is the lack of a policy environment and business model that allow geothermal projects to be commercially viable.
Under the leadership of new President Rob Klenner
In this interview, Klenner discusses the changes in GreenFire Energy
#### An evolving business model
For many years, the identity of GreenFire Energy had been closely tied to its proprietary GreenLoop closed-loop technology. The value proposition of the technology was sufficiently intriguing, seeking to generate geothermal energy from unproductive wells or in challenging geologies where traditional hydrothermal systems were not feasible.
However, GreenFire Energy is shifting focus under President Rob Klenner. Technology will still be a core competency, but the company now aspires to be a full-spectrum geothermal project developer matching technology to the geology for each project. GreenFire has already set an interim goal of building a 150-MW geothermal power portfolio by 2030.
Aside from Klenner, GreenFire Energy has also had some leadership growth with the appointment of Derek Dixon as Vice President of Business Development, and Cory Draper as Vice President of Asset Management. The team brings decades of expertise in energy systems, commercial strategy, and project execution.
Both necessity and opportunity have driven this evolution. To enable geothermal growth, it has to provide dependable and clean baseload energy to both private sector stakeholders and government clients. This means offering bespoke technological solutions that are compatible with the needs of the clients and the unique geology of each site. Rather than continue solely as a technology vendor, GreenFire Energy is stepping into the developer role – identifying viable sites, selecting the right tools for the subsurface, building projects, and delivering power directly to clients.
The vertically integrated approach also positions the company to participate more fully in their projects, with more control over timelines, project outcomes, and client relationships.
The strategic shift does not mean that GreenFire Energy will be abandoning its technological roots. Rather, their patented AGS solution will remain one of the options that GreenFire Energy can offer their customers, particularly in projects where it presents a distinct advantage. GreenFire Energy is now expanding their business with more geothermal solutions that are flexible and site-specific.

#### Matching technology to geology
A key aspect of GreenFire Energy’s new business model is its focus on flexibility. Rather than championing a single technology, GreenFire Energy believes that geology should dictate the optimal solution for geothermal utilization. “You don’t just drill a horizontal well everywhere because that’s your specialty,” “You match the technology to the geology.”
In the geothermal context, this could mean deploying enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) or advanced geothermal systems (AGS) in impermeable formations, or revitalizing conventional resources with downhole heat exchangers. GreenFire Energy has already had hands-on experience with multiple geothermal methodologies, implementing closed-loop concepts at projects in the United States.
This technology-agnostic approach allows GreenFire Energy to be more responsive to project needs, resource constraints, and client expectations. This kind of adaptability is crucial in geothermal, where subsurface parameters may vary widely from one site to the next. As Klenner noted, future projects may even incorporate multiple technologies within a single development, perhaps mixing closed-loop systems with enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) where appropriate.
#### Realigning to a Behind-the-Meter (BTM) model
Recently, GreenFire Energy was announced as one of about a dozen companies that have been granted “awardable” status by the US Department of Energy for geothermal projects. This positions the company to work with the US Air Force, Navy, and Army to develop geothermal solutions for their branches and facilities worldwide.
The engagement with the US DoD is an excellent example of GreenFire Energy’s pivot toward behind-the-meter (BTM), co-located geothermal development. This approach focuses on deploying geothermal power systems directly at or near the sites where the electricity is consumed, such as data centers, military installations, and industrial facilities. The result is a highly localized, modular energy solution that offers several key advantages over traditional utility-scale developments.
The BTM model enables the faster deployment of geothermal power projects by removing the dependence on a distribution grid, which often require regulatory and infrastructure considerations. GreenFire Energy is also open to developing smaller scale power projects when necessary. “We want to be agile and modular,”“We’re focusing on 5- to 25-MW projects that can be deployed quickly and scaled as needed.”
The strategy of phased development also provides the added benefit of reducing early-stage risk and capital intensity. This provides a more accessible pathway to geothermal project development while still maintaining the flexibility to scale up given the right conditions.
In addition to the DoD, GreenFire Energy is pursuing projects with data centers, food processing plants, and even remote communities. Klenner notes that clients are less interested in the technology used for geothermal, but more on the reliability, cost, and emissions reduction that tapping into this energy source can bring. “They just want green electrons,”
#### A 150-MW portfolio by 2030
GreenFire Energy has set an ambitious target of developing 150 MW of installed geothermal capacity by 2030. Rather than banking on a few mega-projects, the company is cultivating a geographically and technologically diverse portfolio. A significant portion of this future portfolio is expected to come from projects with the US DoD. GreenFire Energy is also exploring the concept of integrated energy parks, where geothermal is co-located with solar, wind, nuclear, or gas to create robust, multi-source power hubs.
This phased development strategy allows GreenFire Energy to build experience, de-risk technologies, and generate early revenue—all while laying the foundation for larger-scale deployments. “We want our first 5 MW, then our next 10, and then our next 20,”“It’s about building momentum while being smart with resources.”
The company is also investing in early-stage exploration in areas with high geothermal gradients across the western U.S. These exploratory efforts aim to create a pipeline of future projects that can move quickly once permitting and technical assessments are complete.
![]( Klenner – GreenFire Energy
#### Strengthening support for geothermal in the US
The geothermal industry in the United States has steadily grown momentum in the last few years. Based on recent pronouncements from the Trump administration and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, geothermal appears well-positioned to continue to receive strong policy support. “I think there is a tailwind here with the new administration, and it’s good news for geothermal,”
For GreenFire Energy, the vocal support for geothermal is a welcome development that aligns perfectly with the company’s expanding vision. Klenner remains optimistic about both the current administration’s support and the broader bipartisan consensus around geothermal as a critical pillar of energy security. “Geothermal is bipartisan,”“Whether you care about clean energy or energy dominance, it checks all the boxes.”
However, Klenner also believes more needs to be done to elevate geothermal to the level of other emerging technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture. “The hydrogen hubs got $6 billion. If we got $6 billion for geothermal, we could build projects across the country,”
The company remains active in global markets, including Kenya, Indonesia, and the Philippines, where it provides engineering services and supports local developers. These partnerships are critical to extending in international regions the technologies developed and tested in the US. Klenner sees this as a major growth opportunity in the future. “We’re building megawatts here, but we’re still supporting projects overseas. When the time is right, we’ll develop internationally, too.”
By putting customer needs first, GreenFire Energy aims to leverage technical versatility and partnerships to deploy geothermal projects faster. Setting new goals and business models, the company has had to evolve significantly over the last few months. This is par for the course for the geothermal industry, which has been more dynamic than ever in recent years. As Klenner put it: “Things are always changing. GreenFire Energy has expanded our leadership team, refined our direction, and focused our strategy on domestic projects. If you don’t change, then you can’t move forward as quickly.”

BMW Brilliance, a BMW Chinese joint venture, has started work on a geothermal project to supply heating to the auto manufacturing facility in Shenyang, China.
![](
![](
![](
Under the project, BBA will drill 28 medium-depth geothermal wells to supply a total heating area of approximately 580,000 square meters. When the project becomes operation in the 2025 heating season, BBA’s powertrain production plant and battery center in Shenyang will be 100% heated by sources that are not based on fossil fuels.
Upon completion, the geothermal project is expected to achieve carbon emissions reduction of 18,000 tons per year. Working with BBA for this project are local partners China Huaneng Group, Wanjiang New Energy Co., Ltd., and Shenyang Sino-German Park Development and Construction Group Co., Ltd.
“We have always believed that investing in sustainable development is investing in the future. We continue to use innovative thinking and technology to optimize the carbon footprint of our Shenyang production base, replace fossil fuels with diversified clean energy, and promote energy transformation in accordance with local conditions,
“We have always believed that investing in sustainable development is investing in the future. We continue to use innovative thinking and technology to optimize the carbon footprint of our Shenyang production base, replace fossil fuels with diversified clean energy, and promote energy transformation in accordance with local conditions. Today, our exploration of geothermal energy has entered a new chapter.
In this ‘hot land’ of Shenyang, we will continue to work hard and work with local partners to build a new quality productivity system based on low-carbon sustainability.”
BBA intends to adopt industry-leading technologies for the planned geothermal project in Shenyang, including the use of closed-loop systems that are emissions-free and “take heat but not water.” This geothermal energy project is the latest practice of BBA to actively respond to the Chinese government’s call for green development and achieve sustainable development through innovative production and operation management. It has received strong support from the local government of Shenyang and the active participation of local partners.
China is the world leader in terms of geothermal heating capacity at close to 250 GWt. Local energy enterprise Sinopec is leading the way, providing geothermal heating to more than 90 cities in China.

In a statement made by the “After a determined and challenging exploration process, we proudly learned that Türkiye’s hottest producing geothermal well, reaching a temperature of 308°C, has been successfully discovered.”
In Türkiye, geothermal resources suitable for electricity generation typically range in temperature from 103°C to 295°C. Lower-temperature resources are generally used for thermal tourism and heating purposes. On a global scale, geothermal resources considered suitable for investment in energy production range from 140°C to 370°C.
While Sanko Enerji’s discovery stands out as the hottest geothermal resource in Türkiye to have reached the production stage, previous exploration activities in the country had also recorded high temperatures. In this context, a well drilled by the company had drilled into a 295 °C resource, also in the same field.

Boreholes as deep as 3000 meters are planned for the sites. The deepest borehole planned will be in Kruszwica, with a target depth of 3290 meters.
During the signing ceremony, Minister of Climate and Environment Paulina Hennig-Kloska recounted that the first geothermal research efforts in Wrzesnia were done in the 1970s. “The example of Wrzesnia shows how long the road from plans to implementation of such projects is. This process is rarely complete without state support. And we are aware that it is difficult to carry out such investments on your own.”
“We also know that geothermal sources in a national perspective will never be a key element of the heat acquisition system, but in a local perspective they can solve significant problems. They can also perform many other functions, for example in agriculture or the development of tourist attractions such as geothermal pools.”
The NFOSiGW has supported many Polish geothermal projects through the years, with a good number of them coming far along the development process. In early 2024, one of the project supported by the fund, the Geotermia Kolo heating plant, officially started operations.

In his general policy statement delivered to the National Assembly, newly appointed French Prime Minister François Bayrou cited geothermal energy, as well as nuclear, as important parts of a “low-carbon strategy” towards energy policy.
“Ecology is not the problem. This is the solution,” “The effort to be made on this crucial subject, this adaptation, France has started it better than any country in the world. For me, this is a priority, an ardent obligation that must be pursued and expanded: plan the transition by finalising our low-carbon strategy; preserving our biodiversity; to produce, but in a carbon-free way, thanks to new technologies.”
“I am thinking, in particular, of our energy policy. This policy has one goal: carbon-free energy accessible to all. To achieve this, nuclear power is an essential axis, and geothermal energy, an inexhaustible reservoir of free calories under our feet, is also an essential one.”
Despite having one of the most developed geothermal industries in Europe, geothermal solutions still only contribute only 1% of the final heat consumption in France. To increase the share of all renewables to 38% by 2030, policy support for geothermal in France has been strengthening steadily in recent years. Before the end of 2023, the Ministry of Energy Transition published the finalized action plan that supports the deployment of geothermal energy to meet the needs for renewable heating and cooling for individual and collective buildings in Mainland France.
The these words can only encourage all the players in the geothermal sector to continue their daily action for the development of this carbon-free solution capable of producing heating and cooling in our buildings.”

Reported locally, Cornish Lithium announced having received planning permission to develop the UK’s first commercial geothermal lithium production facility at its
The project, located near Chacewater, will utilize direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology to recover lithium from geothermal waters while returning the water underground—a method designed to minimize environmental impact. We previously reported on the company’s geothermal Lithium work.
A two-phase approach to Lithium pProduction
The project will roll out in two key phases:
1. Phase One – Drilling and testing two 2,000-meter-deep geothermal wells to extract lithium-enriched brine and assess potential for geothermal heating for local homes and businesses.
2. Phase Two – Operating a demonstration plant to validate lithium production, with the aim of supplying battery and electric vehicle manufacturers. If successful, a commercial facility will follow.
Strengthening the UK’s Lithium supply chain
With the UK currently fully reliant on imported lithium, this project is a milestone in developing a sustainable domestic supply. Geothermal lithium extraction presents a low-carbon alternative to traditional mining, aligning with the country’s clean energy transition goals.
Jeremy Wrathall, Founder and CEO of Cornish Lithium, emphasized the importance of the project, stating: “This marks another stage in the UK’s journey from relying solely on imported lithium to maximizing the potential beneath our feet in Cornwall.”
Geothermal’s growing role in critical minerals production
Geothermal lithium projects, such as Cornish Lithium’s initiative, highlight the broader potential of geothermal energy beyond power generation.
With planning permission secured, construction at Cross Lanes is expected to begin this spring, further positioning Cornwall as a leader in sustainable lithium production.

Global electronics manufacturer
Assuming a capacity factor of 90%, the power output under the PPA is equivalent to about 6.3 MWe of installed capacity. The PPA is effective starting 1 April 2025. This is the first geothermal PPA that Panasonic has signed and will go towards achieving zero-CO2 status for their factories in Japan.
Panasonic has been active in its decarbonization efforts since 2022 with its mission of “Realizing a society in which the pursuit of happiness and a sustainable environment are in harmony without contradiction.” The company has already entered into off-site corporate PPAs for solar power generation and onshore wind power generation. The PPA with Kyuden will be the first for geothermal power generation for Panasonic.
With the introduction of the geothermal PPA, the contribution of electricity from renewable energy sources to the company’s domestic electricity use has increased from 15% to 30%.
Further, Panasonic aims to achieve zero CO2 emissions for all of their factories worldwide by 2028.
Kyuden currently operates four geothermal power plants in Japan – the Hatchobaru Power Station (110 MW), Takigami Power Station (27.5 MW), Yamakawa Power Station (30 MW), and Ogiri Power Station (30 MW). Work is underway for another 5-MW geothermal power plant in Kirishima.

Local energy company a substantially long period of deliberation for the location of the Breisgau geothermal heating project.
With this development, the first drilling for the project is planned for 2026 and operations of the heating plant is targeted by 2028.
The exploration permit for the proposed geothermal heating project was granted to badenova in 2021. This was followed in quick succession by an aero-magnetic and gravity survey later in 2021, and a seismic campaign in 2022.
By 2025, badenova will be applying for a permit for the drilling. The aim is to drill into a large water reservoir at 3000 meters depth with potential temperatures of up to 130 °C. If the first drilling is successful, the distribution pipeline and heating plant will be built, serving around 200,000 people around Freiburg. The company expects an investment of about EUR 100 million will be needed for the project.

The start of drilling was marked by event where the Minister of Economic Affairs Kuo Jyh-huei was in attendance. A detailed report on the productivity of the well is expected to be prepared by the first half of 2026. If there are sufficient geothermal resources, then the construction of a power plant can begin.
According to Academia Sinica President James Liao, it took 2 years to determine the location for the drilling of the exploratory well. Exploration methods including magnetotellurics, reflection seismic surveys, and seismic wave imaging were employed to establish a 3D model of the subsurface in the exploration area.
In 2022, CPC Taiwan and Academia Sinica signed a memorandum of cooperation for geothermal development, with exploration starting at the Honchailin area in the Sanxing Township of Yilan County. After two years of exploration work, the Yuanshan area was identified as the prospect for drilling.
The drilling in Yuanshan is only the first in a planned drilling campaign by CPC Taiwan corresponding to an investment of NTD 3.45 billion (approx. USD 107 million). Over the next two to three years, six wells will be drilled in Yuanshan, Tuchang, and other geothermal sites. CPC Taiwan emphasizes that it will drill and evaluate first, and that more deep wells will be drilled if necessary.
Yilan County has long been identified as one of the regions in Taiwan with plenty of geothermal potential. As Minister Kuo mentioned during the ceremony, the success of the Qingshui geothermal power plant highlights the advantages of geothermal development. Further geothermal growth in Yilan can make it a prime spot for data centers, thus also helping the local economy and making Yilan County a hub for digital centers.

“We would like to thank all stakeholders and teams who have supported this project,”
Star Energy Geothermal had contracted Ormat Technologies to deliver the power plant back in 2021. Several COD targets were announced since then, first in 2022, and then by the end of 2023. Despite the setbacks, it is tremendously good news that the binary power plant is now fully operational.
With this development, the total installed geothermal power capacity of Star Energy Geothermal has now increased to 901.5 MW, making it one of the largest geothermal power operators in the world. In 2016, Star Energy Geothermal acquired the geothermal assets of Chevron in Indonesia, which included the Salak and Darajat operating fields.
The company is resolute in strengthening its position in the geothermal power industry, having recently entered into a partnership with SLB on optimizing geothermal operations and technological innovations, and with Kyndryl to integrate AI technologies into their operational activities.

The geothermal heating network of the Societe d´Exploitation de Energies Renouvelables (SEER) will be expanded to three more municipalities in Essonne, France. This has been made possible with a new doublet in the commune of Ris-Orangis, which was drilled in 2023. The announcement was made by
The SEER heating network, co-owned by Sipperec, had originally been put into operations in 2017 to supply the cities of Grigny and Viry-Châtillon. The municipalities of Fleury-Mérogis and Sainte Geneviève-des-Bois eventually joined the heating network, allowing for extension and further supply to the Fleury-Mérogis penitentiary, the largest prison in Europe. Today, the 27-kilometer heating network allows for the supply of geothermal heat to 23,000 homes across five municipalities in Essonne.
This heating network will then be expanded to supply the municipalities of Saint-Michel-sur-Orge, Savigny-sur-Orge, and Morsang-sur-Orge.
The planned expansion will extend the heating network to 65 kilometers by 2032. The expanded heating network is seen to supply heat to 72,000 housing equivalents with heat and domestic hot water. From 130 GWh per year, energy production is expected to more than triple to 437 GWh.
The heating network supplies only about 70% from geothermal sources, with the rest coming from gas boilers.

Gradient Geothermal will be deploying their technology to produce geothermal electricity from the oil and gas assets of Chord Energy in North Dakota.

Colorado-based
Gradient’s proprietary technology removes heat from produced fluids and uses that heat to generate electricity. The company strives to help power the energy transition by harnessing electrical power for mass-distribution from existing oil and gas production infrastructure. Gradient’s unique operational model positions the company as the only scalable commercial operation in the sector that specializes in this innovative form of geothermal energy production.
Using Gradient’s technology, Chord Energy aims to produce geothermal energy at the company’s facilities in North Dakota. This project is partially funded by a grant from the Clean Sustainable Energy Authority (CSEA) of the North Dakota Industrial Commission. By harnessing the thermal energy already present at the site, this approach bolsters the project’s efficiency via converting what would otherwise be wasted heat into a valuable energy asset.
“For too long, key public and private sector stakeholders have not had access to the technology and expertise needed to harness the vast, untapped energy resources beneath our feet,”
“Properly capturing highly sustainable geothermal energy already present at active energy production projects presents a new avenue of opportunity for government agencies and leading commercial entities alike, and we could not be more excited to work with Chord to help deploy Gradient’s innovative technology within this expansive, forward-thinking initiative.”
#### Initial installation in Nevada
Gradient Geothermal, then known as Transitional Energy, had initially deployed their technology at a pilot project at the Blackburn Oilfield in Nevada. The geothermal energy is used to power a portion of project partner Grant Canyon’s operations at the oil field, reducing the total greenhouse gas emission from their operations.

“The water cut in Blackburn is more than 99 %; there is natural aqui­fer recharge because of the rain that falls in the mountains on either side, which means there are no pumps to maintain, and the temperature of the produced water is around 130° C. In other words, the operator knew that they had a geothermal resource on their hands,
Burke further emphasizes the simplicity and the benefits of their approach. “All we do is put a heat exchanger in the existing production layout. The temperature of the injected fluid in Blackburn was always around 40° C.”
Gradient Geothermal was also one of the recipients of a state funding package announced by the Colorado Energy Office earlier this year for innovative geothermal projects. The $100,000 grant will go towards the evaluation of the viability of establishing a thermal energy network for the town of Pierce using hot water extracted from the inactive oil wells of the nearby Pierce Field

A research team from NTU has published the results of a passive seismic study indicating a water-saturated geothermal reservoir in Yishun district, Singapore.

A study conducted by researchers from the
The full paper, “Geothermal potential in Singapore explored with non-invasive seismic data”
Using ambient noise tomography technology, data was collected by placing 80 seismic sensors about 20 meters underground in Sembawang and Yishun. The sensors gathered data for 50 days between May to September 2023. The seismic data from the sensors was then processed to generate a 3D model of the subsurface structures within the study area.
The model indicates a highly fractured, fluid-saturated shallow geothermal reservoir in the Yushin district. Moreover, there is an observed crustal seismic discontinuity at around 4 kilometers depth, indicating a transition from the upper Bukit Timah granite to the porous metasedimentary basement. This could be a deeper aquifer that is feeding the shallow reservoir and, ultimately, the Sembawang hot spring.
#### Future work
With these positive results, another passive seismic campaign has been proposed by the research group that will cover the northeast and south regions of Singapore. The future study site will cover northeastern Punggol Park, down to Ang Mo Kio, Tanjong Pagar, and Chinatown, and towards the south to Bukit Merah.
The team is still applying for permits for the deployment of the sensors, but the target is for the second phase to begin before the end of 2025.
With this approach, geothermal exploration in Singapore is done in a non-invasive manner. It also allows for an optimized frequency and scale of deep drilling, thus reducing the overall costs of development.

![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 4 Nov 2024
Fraunhofer ISE and other partners have launched the ""ThermIon"" project which seeks to develop lithium ion pump technology for geothermal lithium extraction.
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
The “ThermIon”
The project will take into account the entire process chain from the pre-treatment of the brine, through lithium extraction, lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide crystallization to the controlled return of the brine. The challenge is to extract lithium selectively from these geothermal waters without disturbing their complex geochemical equilibrium and risking the precipitation of other ingredients such as silicates and calcites. The latter would involve considerable technical risks for the operation of the geothermal plant.
#### The “lithium ion pump”
Although various process approaches for extracting lithium from thermal water are already being developed, no market-ready technology is yet available. “ThermIon” aims to develop and demonstrate an environmentally friendly, economically attractive and innovative extraction technology that is initially suitable for lithium.
The particular challenge for DLE technologies is to operate them under high temperatures and very high pressures of up to 30 bar over long periods of time. The research team is relying on the “lithium ion pump” process, for which the team has carried out initial preliminary tests in the laboratory. Driven by an electric field, this “pump” stores lithium ions in a special lithium manganese oxide electrode and releases them again into a recovery solution when the polarity is reversed. This enables a concentrated lithium chloride solution of high purity to be obtained.
“I am optimistic that our process will also work on a larger scale and that in the future we will be able to extract lithium directly from the brine during the operation of a geothermal plant. Through this development, we will make a contribution to improving the supply of raw materials in Europe from domestic sources,
#### A transferable technology
Because the thermal water is easily comparable with other locations in the Upper Rhine Graben, the results of the project can be transferred to the 13 planned geothermal projects, which can be developed as pure heat or electricity and heat projects. The process is also fundamentally suitable for the extraction of other valuable materials.
The “ThermIon” project is funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection (BMWK) with around 2.6 million euros for three years.
Fraunhofer ISE is responsible for project management. The following partners from research and industry are also involved:
* BWG Geochemische Beratung GmbH
* Deutsche ErdWärme GmbH
* DVGW Research Centre at the EBI of KIT
* Hydroisotop GmbH
* Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) – Department of Geothermal Research

Most notably, the list does not include solar or wind power.
The listed energy sources stand to benefit from the provisions included in the energy emergency declaration, including:
* The execution of lawful emergency authorities to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, and generation of domestic energy resources, including but not limited to federal lands.
* Expediting of the completion of all authorized and appropriate energy infrastructure, with special emphasis on the West Coast of the United States, Northeast of the United States, and Alaska
* The activation of emergency procedures to fast-track lawful permits and applications pursuant to the Clean Water Act (CWA) and Endangered Species Act (ESA).
* An order to the Department of Defense to assess specific vulnerabilities in the country’s energy infrastructure, witha focus on the Northeast and West Coast regions. This assessment will also identify the requisite authorities and resources to remedy such vulnerability, consistent with applicable law.
Another positive sign for the US geothermal sector is the nomination of Chris Wright to be the head of the Department of Energy. Wright is the founder of oilfield services company Liberty Energy, which is one of the investors of Fervo Energy, a company working on Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) projects in Utah and Nevada.
During a Senate confirmation ceremony, Wright stated that his belief that geothermal is a “tremendous potential energy source”

Geothermal has gained strong bipartisan support in the US in recent years, demonstrated by a long-list of pro-geothermal policies that have been proposed and passed both at the state and federal levels. The US Department of Energy has also shown exceptional support for the geothermal sector, increasing awareness for the heating and cooling sector, and providing funding for research in the fields of geothermal exploration, EGS, scale inhibition, and critical minerals research among others.

Philippine-based geothermal developer and operator
SNGP currently has a total dependable capacity of 221.8 MW across its operating plants, namely the Palinpinon Power Plant Units I and II, the Nasulo Geothermal Power Plant, and the Nasuji Geothermal Power Plant. The field is operating at 241.8 steam field capacity with 94 wells in 32 well pads.
Relating to this project, EDC secured an environmental compliance certificate (ECC) of a 5163-hectare development block back in 2017. The ECC was amended in July 2023 to include a provision for a 30-MW battery energy storage system. Another ECC is currently being processed to reduce the size of the development block to only 4027.59 hectares, which EDC states is enough to the drilling of new wells and construction of supporting infrastructure.
Accordingly, the project area is proposed to be expanded from 151.5 hectares to 400 hectares to support infrastructure related to the capacity expansion.
EDC remains very active in the expansion of their installed geothermal power generation capacity, both in the local and international fronts. The company still has at least three binary power plants in development, after the inauguration of the 28.9-MW Palayan Bayan binary plant in the Bacon-Manito field. Just recently, EDC was awarded two geothermal sites for preliminary survey and exploration in Indonesia.

The 10 MW of capacity to be added through this partnership is expected to come online in 2029will double Taiwan’s current installed geothermal capacity
Baseload Capital, a Sweden-based geothermal investment firm, has operated in Taiwan since 2019 through its local subsidiary
“This agreement underscores the growing market recognition of – and demand for – 24/7 clean, firm energy. Our partnership highlights how Baseload’s mission aligns with Google’s portfolio, creating powerful synergies for sustainable tech growth,” said Alexander Helling, CEO of Baseload Capital.
A Model for the Region
Taiwan’s location on the Pacific Ring of Fire gives it considerable geothermal potential – estimated between 30 to 60 GW- yet commercial development has lagged behind other renewable sources. The Google–Baseload agreement is positioned as a catalyst for geothermal market growth in Asia, helping de-risk investment and spur corporate procurement.
Globally, this is not Google’s first step into geothermal. In 2023, the tech company secured 115 MW of geothermal power through a clean transition tariff with NV Energy and Fervo Energy in Nevada. In another bold move, Meta also signed a deal with Sage Geosystems for up to 150 MW of geothermal power in the U.S., expected online by 2027.
For the Geothermal Sector
The announcement demonstrates how major technology firms are now driving demand for firm, always-available renewable energy and expanding geothermal’s role in global decarbonization. It also showcases Baseload Capital’s growing portfolio and ability to attract world-leading partners, reinforcing its position as a key player in next-generation geothermal investment.

A case study in Nyon, Switzerland highlights how innovative technologies can help improve community acceptance of seismic surveys for geothermal exploration.

![](
In October 2024, flashing lights and hi-vis-clad workers lit up the streets on the outskirts of Nyon, Switzerland. This team looked like any regular maintenance crew working the streets after dark, but in the center of the buzz was a very different type of work vehicle. Equipped with a moveable vibrating element under the chassis, a “vibroseis” truck was being used to create low-frequency source vibrations for a 3D seismic project to map the subsurface of the area.
This was the second of three 3D seismic acquisition campaigns planned across 42 communes around Nyon, Vinzel, and Morges. The project was commissioned via a joint venture between
During the survey, two vibroseis trucks operated simultaneously within the designated quadrangle over several consecutive nights. These trucks generated sound waves that penetrated deep into the subsurface, reflecting off various geological formations. The reflected waves were then captured at ground level by seismic receivers strategically positioned at intervals along the route.
#### Seismic data acquisition using compact receiver nodes
For its 3D seismic acquisition projects,

These advanced devices enable high-density seismic surveys that deliver rapid access to the high-resolution data needed to make informed decisions, derisking the subsurface geology and leading to optimal geothermal well placement.
This high-density survey employed 5,000 seismic receiver points to capture an extensive volume of data, which is now undergoing data processing. Using sophisticated algorithms and software, the raw seismic data acquired by the nodes is being refined and transformed into detailed 3D subsurface models and interpretations. These models provide the most accurate and noninvasive geological insights, delivering critical information in the most effective way possible.
The success of producing geothermal energy for heating and electricity projects hinges on locating resources that are both sufficiently hot and productive, underscoring the critical role of seismic data in helping geologists pinpoint these hotspots. Improving knowledge of the subsurface through high-density seismic data acquisition enhances the resolution of subsurface images, increasing the chances of identifying optimal geothermal resources while minimizing geological risks during geothermal well construction.
Accompanying me in observing the acquisition process in action were Geo2X’s joint CEOs Chloé Nicaty and David Dupuy. They described STRYDE nodes as “fantastic” in that their small size and ability to be almost entirely buried makes them invisible to passers-by and therefore minimizes the chance of theft and data loss. Another highlight of these nodes is that they offer significant cost savings for their clients, not only because their price per channel is significantly lower than competing technologies but also due to reduced labor and logistical requirements.
They also observed their ability to accelerate project timelines, enabled by more streamlined deployment and retrieval processes, which require only half the personnel typically needed for managing receivers.
#### Minimizing disruptions, maximizing coverage
The survey area was meticulously planned to ensure maximum coverage while accounting for natural and manmade obstacles. The vibroseis trucks were restricted to existing, surfaced roads, requiring the receivers—ideally placed a few meters from the trucks’ path—to follow these routes. In most cases, nodes were installed on municipal land, but when access to private property was necessary, landowners were contacted directly and asked to grant permission for receiver placement and the passage of the vibroseis team. To ensure transparency, every resident in the survey area received a flyer detailing the project and informing them when to expect the trucks and crews.
Several weeks prior to the acquisition, the receivers were strategically placed along the trace route and programmed to record data exclusively during the designated acquisition period. As fully autonomous devices, these nodes operate independently, requiring no external power or real-time data transfer, minimizing interaction with people and the environment.
The preference was always to bury the nodes as this ensures better reception of the seismic waves as well as avoiding damage or loss. Even in the denser urban areas it was usually possible to find enough soil for the nodes to be buried in holes approximately five by ten centimeters deep. When this was not possible, the nodes were attached to a metal spike and baseplate or zip-tied to surrounding infrastructure and hidden as best as possible.
The Wi-Fi-free, autonomous design of the STRYDE nodes addresses the public’s privacy and safety concerns, particularly in residential areas. With full autonomy, the nodes are safe, secure, and virtually invisible during operations and are ideal for sensitive environments where public trust and minimal disruption are essential for success.
As the crew proceeded on foot down a quiet back street between the lake and the gardens of Prangins Chateau, they entered the private property of stately homes and farm structures. Curious onlookers waved from a window above, and dogs barked from behind a barn as the truck moved steadily along its route, pausing every 20 meters at designated vibration points before continuing to the next.
Each vibration had a single sweep lasting about 30 seconds, producing a sound comparable to that of a passing vehicle or the distant hum of a construction site. They could be felt underfoot when standing right next to the truck but even a few meters away the vibrations were minimal and cows grazing in a paddock nearby barely lifted their heads.
When the team passed through particularly sensitive areas or close to livestock or property, the vibrations were closely monitored by a portable seismometer to ensure that the amplitude of seismic waves produced by the truck was low enough to avoid damage or disturbance to the surrounding structures or livestock. The seismic vibrations produced by the vibroseis vehicles were well below limits imposed by the Swiss norms, but the precise locations and power of each vibration point were logged for future reference.
The surveys were conducted after nightfall, early in the evening, to minimize interference from ambient natural noise and avoid disruptions to local traffic. The trucks traversed the trace lines only once, and the nodes left no visible imprint or damage to the properties, which significantly eased the process of obtaining buy-in and land access approval from landowners.
Once the Vibroseis trucks completed their operations and the nodes finished recording, the collection of the receivers began in the historic, downtown area of Nyon. Workers headed out again on foot armed with specially designed, lightweight backpacks that carry up to 90 nodes per person, in neat racks. The exercise was simple and quick, requiring only six days to retrieve 5,000 nodes using five small teams of two to three people, with minimal training.

Once the nodes were located and de-activated by a custom-designed initialization device and loaded into the trays they were collected by a small vehicle and taken back to the depot for data harvesting and charging.
One of the Geo2X crew, Benoit Goudard, explained; “The GPS location points were accurately recorded by the STRYDE field navigation tablet during their placement so that the nodes can be easily located for rapid retrieval”. This is the second time Benoit has worked with the STRYDE nodal system and with only one day of formal training he was quickly able to head up the retrieval teams and start the data harvesting process.
#### Getting eyes on the data
Because the STRYDE nodal system is fully autonomous, it does not transmit data in real-time; instead, data is stored within each node and retrieved after the acquisition phase. This approach offers several advantages ranging from operational efficiencies where complexity and points of failure are minimized, allowing for more streamlined field operations, to cost-effectiveness where reducing the need for extensive communication networks leads to lower operational costs and resource requirements.
Once the nodes come in from the field, the racks holding the ten individual nodes are slotted together to make a tray of 90 nodes and loaded into a charging and data harvesting “nest” which resembles a large suitcase. Up to six of these “nests” work in tandem to charge and harvest 540 nodes within four hours.
![]( STRYDE charging and data harvesting system. (source: STRYDE)
The data is transferred via an optical link and loaded directly onto computers allowing a first look at the raw data from the seismic survey. This streamlined harvesting system, requiring no dismantling of parts, connectors, or separate charging of batteries, allows important gains in time by minimizing handling of the receivers from the moment they arrive from the field to the download of data.
#### The need for new and better seismic
The absence of publicly available modern high-resolution and high-density seismic data in Switzerland has created a competitive and strategic imperative for new high-quality 3D seismic data. Unlike countries like Denmark, where seismic data is centralized and shared to facilitate collaborative planning and minimize duplication of effort, Swiss companies must rely on their own resources to secure the detailed subsurface information needed to accurately assess geothermal potential and mitigate exploration risks.
This environment has driven demand for modern, high-resolution data necessary for making informed decisions and maintaining a competitive edge in the fast-growing geothermal market. Recognizing the critical importance of data density and quality in reducing risk and optimizing outcomes, there has been a notable shift toward more widespread adoption of high-density 3D seismic mapping for geothermal exploration in Switzerland.
Until recently, 3D seismic mapping for geothermal exploration was both costly and complex, primarily due to the bulky and outdated receiver equipment traditionally used to record seismic data. This often restricted companies to conducting smaller scale 2D surveys or relying on legacy data, both of which lacked the detail necessary for making well-informed decisions. Technological advancements, such as the introduction of STRYDE’s small, autonomous nodes, have significantly reduced the costs of high-density 3D surveys, making them feasible and efficient, even in densely populated urban areas like Nyon.
The vast amount of data collected during the survey will be utilized by EnergeÔ throughout the geothermal exploration process and will eventually be made publicly available for research, fostering further advancements in geothermal energy development.
#### Applying a proven blueprint to help companies unlock geothermal potential
Back in the Geo2X office, the planning and permitting team was already working on another upcoming project around the city of Lausanne. This preliminary phase is an important and complex part of any seismic acquisition project and will often take anything from six months to a year to complete.
Streamlining the permitting and planning phase ensures the success of the overall project and helps the acquisition phase run as smoothly as possible. To start this process off, Geo2X creates maps of the survey area and breaks them down into grids, representing the parcels of land and their status concerning access permission, obstacles, etc. The number of parcels to consider can reach in the tens of thousands and the acquisition route can be adjusted dynamically depending on access to land parcels and roads.
Recognizing the complexity and critical importance of this phase for seamless project execution and ensuring data acquisition without gaps, Geo2X has assembled a dedicated team of four to five specialists. This team works closely with private landholders, facilitating direct communication while efficiently managing the extensive information required for planning and permitting processes.
Impressively, Geo2X has also created a purpose-built software application with interactive maps where stakeholders can access up-to-date information on the status of parcels access, the progress of the acquisition, the data harvesting results, etc. The public is also given access to parts of the application via a QR code on the flyer and can follow, in real-time, the progress of the survey, giving local people insight into when the seismic crew and vehicles will be in their area.
Providing local residents with access to real-time survey information about activities in their areas is crucial for fostering transparency, keeping the community informed, and minimizing potential conflicts. This proactive approach has enabled Geo2X to build trust and help ensure residents can prepare for any disruptions, resulting in the delivery of seamless seismic surveys for their clients.

The use of small, non-intrusive receivers has been pivotal in the permitting and operational phases of the survey. With a robust and well-defined approach to surveying and a large inventory of nodes, that sit neatly and discreetly in a corner of their facility, Geo2X has cemented its position as a leading seismic contractor in this rapidly growing region, where the demand for high-quality 3D seismic data continues to rise.
Geo2X’s upcoming 3D seismic acquisition campaigns around Morges and Lausanne in 2025 will showcase the critical importance of their expertly executed, efficient, and cost-effective seismic solutions. By setting a benchmark for successful geothermal exploration, Geo2X is not only advancing sustainable energy development in Switzerland but also paving the way for similar initiatives across Europe, propelling the green energy transition to new heights.

# New demonstration project starts for super-hot rock EGS in Newberry, Oregon

Mazama Energy has announced the start of a demonstration project for superhot rock enhanced geothermal systems in the Newberry site in Oregon.
![](

![](
“Super-Hot Rock” in this context refers to rocks that have a temperature of 375 °C or greater and when extracted can provide several times the power density than lower temperature rock. The heat recovery needs to be engineered by EGS because the rocks are naturally impermeable. The goal for the demonstration project is to show for the first time that a commercially viable geothermal reservoir can be created in super-hot rocks.
#: Harnessing heat from SuperHot rock: The Mazama Energy approach
“Geothermal energy has the smallest environmental footprint of any renewable power source we now have and can provide 24/7 baseload power without any emission of CO2
“The purpose of the Newberry SHR Demonstration project is to show that the new technology developed by Mazama Energy will enable the economic extraction of heat from the earth in locations where it was considered not possible so far. This demonstration project will benefit from an important support of the U.S. Department of Energy and conducted in close collaboration with Oregon State University and several national research institutions,”
Enhanced Geothermal Systems are geothermal reservoirs created in hot, low permeability rock by injecting cold water to create permeability in solid rock. This means an EGS can be sited in areas without naturally occurring hydrothermal resources with surface manifestations such as hot springs and fumaroles. As such, an EGS could theoretically be sited anywhere there is geothermal heat that is economically recoverable.
Until now, a major challenge facing EGS projects has been the cost. Since geothermal wells can cost several million dollars to construct, increasing the generation capacity of each well is critically important for making it more competitive on the open market for electricity. Systems with single stimulated zones simply don’t yield enough power per well to make the electricity produced cost competitive. Having the ability to create multiple stimulated zones from a single well increases the amount of power produced by the well, and thus decreases the overall cost of the power produced.
The Newberry project of Mazama Energy was one of three projects to receive funding from the US Department of Energy during the first funding round for EGS projects, as announced early 2024. A second funding round has since been announced that seeks to support proposed EGS projects in the eastern United States.

The city of Erfurt in Thuringia, Germany is planning a 3D seismic measurement campaign in the summer of 2025 to explore for a potential geothermal reservoir for district heating. This follows up on the original plans announced by local utility
The seismic measurement campaign will involve nine special vibration vehicles that will transmit vibrations into the subsurface, which will then be reflected and detected in the surface by 12,000 measuring devices or geo-phones. The same exploration method to has been used to great success in several cities in Germany, as well as in Switzerland, France, the Netherlands, and Denmark.
The aim of the study is to analyze the nature of the rock layers in order to identify a potential reservoir for the use of deep geothermal energy. The database obtained can be used to create precise 3D models of the subsurface, which can later be used to plan drilling.
The main measurement area will cover 136 square kilometers in the city of Erfurt, including surrounding communities such as Udestedt, Großrudestedt, and Riethnordhausen. All affected property owners and residents will be informed at an early stage. SWE Energie puts great importance in the welfare of the people and the environment, and assures that the vibroseismic technology to be used has low emissions and impact, and that measuring points will be carefully planned to protect sensitive locations.

# Vulcan to supply BASF chemical production facility in Germany with geothermal heat
!Vulcan to supply BASF chemical production facility in Germany with geothermal heat The Ludwigshafen facility of chemical manufacturer BASF (source: BASF)
![ ](
![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 24 Nov 2024
Vulcan Energy has entered into an agreement to supply geothermal heat for industrial use of chemical producer BASF in Germany, with possible lithium extraction.
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
This announcement follows up on two similarly big announcements that Vulcan has made within the last two weeks – the start of lithium hydroxide production at the company’s CLEOP site in Frankfurt, and the awarding of EUR 100 million federal funding from the Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection of Germany.
Beyond reducing the CO2 emissions of BASF’s Ludwigshafen site, the geothermal opportunity extends to the potential for district heating to supply households in nearby cities. Vulcan and BASF are collaborating with regional energy providers
The two partners plant to evaluate the possible construction and operation of a Lithium Extraction Plant on the BASF premises to produce lithium salts concentrate following energy production from the hot brine. This will then be transported to Vulcan’s Central Lithium Plant to produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide for the European electric vehicle market.
Approximately 2000–2500 GWh/a of heat generation is targeted from the Ludwigsland Development Project (LDP) from an integrated renewable heat and lithium brine operation, representing a significant amount of the heat demand of BASF. Ludwigshafen is BASF’s global headquarters. With a workforce of around 34,000 people, it serves as a key economic and industrial hub within the Upper Rhine Valley and is a significant contributor to the region’s growth and development.
Vulcan seeks to replicate this model across the Upper Rhine Valley. The company aims to build geothermal heating facilities to decarbonize industrial facilities and the public heating sector, while also utilizing the geothermal brine to produce lithium chloride.
“Partnering with Germany’s largest chemical company, BASF, to provide renewable geothermal heat at their Ludwigshafen headquarters is an excellent demonstration of Vulcan Energy’s dual commitment to decarbonise energy and lithium production via our integrated business approach,”
“This collaboration highlights how geothermal renewable energy and carbon neutral lithium production can work harmoniously together, delivering mutual benefits for industry and communities.”
“We want to supply our Ludwigshafen site with C-free steam in the future. In addition to harnessing the waste heat from our production facilities, where possible, we want to consider renewable heat sources from geothermal structures,”
#### The terms of the agreement
BASF will jointly fund the geothermal exploration as the first phase of the project. Assuming the first phases of the project, including seismic campaigns, exploratory well and doublet drilling are successful, and the partners decide to proceed with the project, BASF will be the heat offtaker for 100% of the geothermal heat
There will be three stages to the project:
1. 2D seismic campaigns in the 2024/2025 winter season and a follow-up 3D seismic survey in 2025/2026 winter season to determine the well site locations. The costs of the 2D and 3D seismic surveys are to be borne evenly by the project partners.
2. Subject to successful seismic campaigns, identification of suitable drilling targets and public funding being obtained, the parties intend to drill, log and test one well with further details to be agreed within a co-operation agreement.
3. Subject to the first well producing sufficient quantities of hot brine, lithium and geothermal energy, the parties will decide whether to drill an estimated 12 new production and 12 re-injection wells on an estimated 5 new well sites. Each well cluster would contain a heat transfer station connected to Vulcan’s Lithium Extraction Plant on BASF premises within the Ludwigshafen complex and BASF heating station via a new pipeline system, with BASF to act as facilitator.

The MoU was signed between the two parties during the 8th Indonesia-Japan Energy Forum (IJEF) held in Bali, Indonesia on 5 December 2024. “The discussion at this forum highlighted the commitment of both countries to achieve Net Zero Emission outlined in national policies, including roadmap programs, and their activities,”
Through the MoU, INPEX aims to form a cooperative effort with PLN IP on geothermal development and exploration in Indonesia. IGE established its office in Indonesia in October 2022 and has since promoted geothermal business opportunities. The MOU is a part of these ongoing efforts.
IGE currently owns stakes in three operating geothermal power plants in Indonesia – Muara Laboh, Rantau Dedap, and Sarulla. In early 2023, IGE acquired stake in the Rajabasa geothermal field, an exploration site in Lampung. The company is also involved in several geothermal exploration efforts in Japan.
INPEX seeks to enhance and emphasize renewable energy initiatives, which are one of the 5 net zero businesses outlined in the company’s “INPEX Vision @2022” announced on February 9, 2022. As part of the vision, INPEX will accelerate its initiatives aimed at its geothermal power generation business, which can utilize the technologies cultivated by the company through oil and natural gas development. Moreover, the company will proactively engage in energy structure reforms towards the realization of a net zero carbon society while fulfilling its responsibilities for the stable development and supply of energy.

Over EUR36.5 million has been allocated to geothermal research at Weisweiler, as part of structural transformation efforts in Germany’s Rhenish coal mining area.

![](
![](
The
The Weisweiler project focuses on utilizing geothermal energy and developing related technologies to support Germany’s industrial energy transition. This includes exploring the use of geothermal fluids for energy and resource extraction, such as lithium recovery, as well as underground thermal storage.
The research ties into the broader framework of Germany’s coal phase-out, supported by the federal government’s Investment Act for Coal Regions (InvKG). This legislation allocates up to EUR 14.8 billion in structural assistance for the Rhenish mining area until 2038. The funds aim to revitalize post-mining landscapes, upgrade towns and villages, and promote future-proof employment opportunities.
Weisweiler, historically powered by lignite from the nearby Inden open-pit mine, still operates two 600 MW units. However, coal-based electricity generation at the site is scheduled to cease by 2029. In preparation for this transition, exploratory geothermal drilling has already taken place, with two wells reaching depths of 100 and 500 meters in 2023 and 2024. These efforts are part of the Interreg research project DGE-ROLLOUT, coordinated by North Rhine-Westphalia’s Geological Service.
The Fraunhofer IEG has installed a seismic monitoring station and a geothermal probe in these wells, paving the way for further study and development of deep geothermal energy in the region.

Countries in the Western Tropical Pacific region have some of the highest electricity costs in the world right now due to the use of expensive, imported diesel power generation that has limited electrification and economic development. The goal of Stellae Energy is to to develop economically sustainable geothermal power projects in this region by harnessing abundant volcanic island arc energy resources in collaboration with regional governments through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs).
Stellae Energy has previously announced the signing of detailed MOU’s with the governments of Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, and the Autonomous Region of Bougainville and discussions are ongoing with other regional governments.
The company has been actively working together with the various government ministries and departments of these countries to gather technical and commercial information necessary for comprehensive Pre-Feasibility Reports. These reports have detailed the good potential of geothermal resources and outlined the roadmap for project development in each country.
“We are excited about the opportunity to partner with governments in this region to unlock their geothermal potential,”These projects will not only provide a reliable and sustainable energy source but also support the economic development and energy independence of their countries.”
The goals of these geothermal energy initiatives include: (1) providing a reliable and sustainable energy resource for each country; (2) enhancing energy security and reducing dependency on imported fossil fuels; (3) supporting economic development and creating job opportunities within local communities; and (4) contributing to global climate change mitigation efforts by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Stellae Energy remains committed to working closely with regional governments, local communities, and landowners to ensure the responsible development of geothermal resources, with a focus on environmental stewardship and respect for local cultures.

A new report published by the
The full report, “Prospectivity for geothermal power in the Northern Territory”
The study seeks to determine the prospectivity for geothermal power generation using current and emerging technologies related to three broad strategies for producing geothermal energy :
* Hot sedimentary aquifers (HSA)
* Engineered geothermal systems (EGS)
* Advanced geothermal systems (AGS)
Prospectivity, in the context of the report, refers to the likelihood that geologic conditions at any given location and depth would support geothermal power generation. The assessment focuses strictly on geological conditions – economic assessment and other factors for financial modeling were beyond the scope of the study.
The study generated prospectivity maps for HSA, EGS, and AGS, and for overburden rock strength. Evaluation of different strategies indicated significantly distributed prospective regions. However, the McArthur Basin stood out as a potential hosting location for all three of the considered strategies.

The Government of Iceland has opened the application for grants for the “Geothermal Leveling the Game initiative”,
Recently announced by Jóhann Páll Jóhannsson, Minister of the Environment, Energy and Climate, this is the largest geothermal initiative that has been undertaken in Iceland this century.
Emphasis is placed on supporting the use of geothermal energy for general heating in areas where electricity and/or oil are currently used for heating. About 10% of households in the country are in so-called cold areas, and the Treasury spends over 2.5 billion ISK annually on subsidizing heating in these areas.
The grants that have now been announced will be awarded to municipalities, energy companies, or parties working on their behalf. When awarding grants, consideration will be given to whether there is already some knowledge of geothermal energy in the area in question and whether there is evidence that hot water can be found that can be used directly in the district heating system, or warm water in sufficient quantities to be used in a central heat pump in the area.
The grant amount for each project can be up to two-thirds of the total project cost, with a matching contribution from the applicant. The projects can focus on initiating exploitation where appropriate, or on further research with reference to previous results.

The USA Chapter of
From this series, we are now feature Terra Rogers, Program Director for Superhot Rock Energy at
Terra initially worked as a chemical engineer after graduating from the Colorado School of Mines. She then pursued an MBA from the Harvard Business School, which led to her developing an interest in renewable energy, and eventually to the field of geothermal energy.
#### A pivot to geothermal
Terra’s technical background and experience, paired with an interest in energy solutions, eventually led her to explore renewable energy sources. As her career evolved, she recognized the potential of geothermal energy as an underutilized yet incredibly potent source of clean and consistent power. This realization sparked her pivot into geothermal, where she believed her skills in engineering, data analysis, and communication could make a significant impact.
Today, as the Program Director for Superhot Rock (SHR) Energy at the Clean Air Task Force (CATF), Rogers is pioneering efforts to harness the potential of this technology. SHR geothermal taps into the subsurface temperatures exceeding 400°C, which provides higher energy density for power generation and may make geothermal projects feasible on a global scale.
For Rogers, this technology represents a key opportunity to reshape the future of clean energy, offering a more scalable and reliable solution compared to existing renewable options.

#### The importance of information
Rogers recognizes that there is a significant gap in public understanding and awareness of geothermal energy, particularly SHR. She also believes that a geothermal policy backed by unbiased reporting is key to enabling the development of projects both locally and internationally. In an industry that hopes to get more interest from venture capital, sharing information publicly can attract investors but may also jeopardize intellectual property. Therefore, a regulated ecosystem for data sharing is essential.
To tackle this challenge, Rogers has focused on advocacy and education. She understands the importance of sharing accurate, compelling information with diverse stakeholders—from government officials who can shape policy to industry leaders who can drive innovation. Terra and the SHR team at CATF are preparing five technology gap reports that aim to describe the limiting factors for SHR, hoping to help inform policy decisions to foster a more transparent and secure environment for innovation and project development.
Recently, Rogers testified on behalf of H.R. 8665 the Supercritical Geothermal Research and Development Act, to the US House of Representatives – which, according to Rogers, was a “significant step toward recognizing the unparalleled potential of the next generations of geothermal energy in the US energy portfolio”.

#### Don’t think small
To someone trying to start in the geothermal industry, Terra advises not to think small. This underscores her belief in the massive potential of geothermal to disrupt the global energy market. It is this belief that fuels her passion to drive the activation of funding for geothermal projects, recognizing that costs can reduced if there is a wider recognition of the terawatt-scale potential of geothermal.
Rogers continues to advocate for a venture-backed first-of-its-kind geothermal project that shows the energy density of a SHR system. She believes that international collaboration and knowledge sharing are crucial, recognizing similar advancements in EGS would not have been possible without collaboration.
Terra’s vision is for the geothermal industry to leverage these cross-industry innovations and international collaborations to realize its full potential. By doing so, geothermal energy can become a major player in the global energy market, providing a sustainable, energy-dense power source.

# Geomechanics: The Backbone of Geothermal Energy
!Geomechanics: The Backbone of Geothermal Energy ""Geomechanics: The backbone of geothermal energy"" - a guest article by TEVERRA
![ ](
![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 28 Jan 2025
The study of geomechanics plays a crucial yet underappreciated role in geothermal energy, from wellbore stability to effectivity of hydraulic stimulation.
![](

![](
Geomechanics, the study of the mechanical behavior of rocks and soils, plays a crucial role in developing and operating geothermal energy systems, particularly in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) and Superhot Rock (SHR) projects. By understanding the stress state, rock strength, and fluid flow behavior in the subsurface, geomechanics helps to optimize well design, hydraulic fracturing, and reservoir management (Liu et al., 2022).
While this is conceptually understood, there is still some confusion of just how valuable and extensive geomechanics studies can be within the geothermal industry. In the worst case scenario, no geomechanical model or an incorrect model could lead to improper wellbore treatment and wellbore loss, in the best case scenario, a proper geomechanical model can lead to a successful, optimized, profitable geothermal power plant.
This guest article written by
#### Wellbore Stability
Wellbore stability is vital in successfully developing and operating geothermal energy projects, particularly in high-temperature and high-pressure environments. Extreme temperatures, high fluid pressures, and thermal stresses can significantly impact wellbore integrity.
Geomechanical analysis is essential to predict and mitigate potential stability issues, including borehole collapse, borehole enlargement, and lost circulation, to ensure the long-term viability of geothermal wells. By optimizing drilling fluid design, casing, cementation programs, and wellbore completion strategies, engineers can enhance wellbore stability and maximize geothermal energy’s economic and environmental benefits (Madyarov et al., 2021).
![]( of wellbore stability simulation model results: maximum principal stress (left) and minimum principal stress (right) distributions around the wellbore with hydrostatic pressure in the wellbore. (Madyarov et al., 2021)
The figure above shows an example of wellbore stability simulation model results: maximum principal stress (left) and minimum principal stress (right) distributions around the wellbore with hydrostatic pressure in the wellbore.
#### Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing, a well-established technique in the oil and gas industry, has been adapted for use in the geothermal industry to enhance reservoir permeability and improve energy extraction. By injecting high-pressure fluid into the subsurface formation, hydraulic fracturing creates complex fracture networks that facilitate the flow of geothermal fluids to the production well and efficient heat extraction from the reservoir.
However, the 20 years of hydraulic fracturing experience in the oil and gas industry shows that not all hydraulic fracturing designs are successful. Geomechanical modeling is crucial in optimizing hydraulic fracturing operations by predicting fracture propagation, minimizing induced seismicity, and maximizing reservoir productivity. Careful consideration of factors such as rock properties, in-situ stress state, and fluid injection parameters is essential to ensure the success of hydraulic fracturing treatments in geothermal reservoirs (Porlles & Jabbari, 2022).
#### Superhot Rock (SHR) Geothermal Systems
Superhot Rock (SHR) geothermal systems offer a promising avenue for harnessing vast amounts of geothermal energy from deep, high-temperature rock formations (Houde et al., 2021). These systems involve drilling deep wells into the Earth’s crust to access hot rock, fractured to create a reservoir. Water is injected into the fractures to extract heat, which is then used to generate electricity.
While there is significant opportunity, the extreme temperature and pressure conditions associated with SHR systems pose significant technical challenges, including wellbore stability, induced seismicity, and corrosion. Advanced drilling technologies, hydraulic fracturing techniques, and robust wellbore design are essential to overcome these challenges, many of which cannot be tested until SHR drilling commences.
By understanding the geomechanical properties of the rock formations and simulating drilling and wellbore completion in SHR conditions, the industry can progress towards optimizing the design and operation of SHR systems. Once successful, SHR will unlock the enormous potential of this clean and sustainable energy source (Cladouhos & Callahan, 2024).

The figure above shows a geomechanical numerical model (geometry and mesh) performed to test wellbore stability of a hypothetical superhot rock wellbore.
#### Proppant Selection
Proppant selection in the geothermal industry involves choosing solid, granular materials pumped into hydraulic fractures to maintain their permeability and enhance fluid flow.
Unlike conventional oil and gas applications, geothermal reservoirs often experience higher temperatures and pressures and exposure to corrosive fluids. These operating conditions are incompatible with many oil and gas industry proppants; therefore, proppants must be carefully selected to withstand these harsh conditions and maintain their integrity over time.
Key factors to consider in proppant selection include proppant lab analysis using geomechanics crushing test, particle size distribution, strength, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and cost-effectiveness. By optimizing proppant selection and placement, engineers can improve the performance of geothermal reservoirs and maximize energy extraction (Liu et al., 2023).
#### Thermal Stress Analysis
Thermal stress analysis in the geothermal industry involves evaluating the impact of temperature gradients on the mechanical behavior of rock formations and wellbore components. High-temperature differences between the hot reservoir rock and the cooler drilling fluid or injected water can induce significant thermal stresses, leading to potential issues such as wellbore instability, rock fracture, and reduced reservoir productivity.
Geomechanical modeling techniques, including finite element analysis (FEA), simulate thermal stress distribution and assess its impact on wellbore integrity and reservoir performance. By understanding the thermal stress regime, engineers can optimize well design, casing selection, and production strategies to mitigate the risks associated with thermal expansion and contraction (Zhou et al., 2022). Geomechanics helps us to understand crack patterns of the numerical model are shown in figure below.
![]( model (a–d) and experimental specimen (e–h) at different temperatures after uniaxial compression failure (Zhou et al., 2022).
#### The Future of Geomechanics in Geothermal Energy
The future use and application of geomechanics in geothermal energy could unlock immense resource potential, with technological advancements and a growing emphasis on sustainable energy sources. By integrating advanced numerical modeling techniques, machine learning, and real-time monitoring, geomechanics will be crucial in optimizing well design, improving drilling efficiency, and enhancing reservoir productivity.
As the industry continues to explore new energy extraction approaches, such as enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) and superhot rock (SHR) technologies, geomechanics will be essential in addressing complex challenges related to wellbore stability, hydraulic fracturing, and reservoir management (Jia et al., 2022).
By understanding the intricate interplay between geological, mechanical, and thermal processes, geomechanics will pave the way for the sustainable development and utilization of geothermal energy.

Drilling of the GT-1 exploratory geothermal well in the Velika Gorica area in Croatia has officially started. The well will be drilled to a depth of around 3000 meters, where temperatures between 90 to 140 °C are expected. Findings from this exploratory well will provide valuable information on the possibilities of geothermal use for district heating systems in Velika Gorica.
The project is being carried out within the framework of the project “Preparation and Research of Geothermal Potential in the Context of District Heating”. Funding of EUR 50.8 million for the project has been secured in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) as a measure to encourage energy efficiency, district heating, and renewable energy source. The Velika Gorica project has an investment value of more than EUR 11 million.
“Croatia is rich in geothermal potential, and this investment is part of a broader energy independence strategy. The Government of the Republic of Croatia will continue to support projects that use renewable energy sources and contribute to economic growth and development,”
“In the context of the growing need for energy security and the initiated process of energy transition in the Republic of Croatia, geothermal energy offers unique solutions that are stable, renewable, reliable, independent of weather conditions and environmentally friendly,”
“For the above reasons, the construction of the Velika Gorica exploratory geothermal well represents the basis for a possible transformation of the heating system in continental Croatia and a key step towards creating a sustainable heating system that will use domestic resources to reduce dependence on energy imports.”
The Mayor of Velika Gorica, Krešimir A?kar, emphasized the importance of this infrastructure project for the local community: “The project to explore geothermal potential in the Velika Gorica area is one of the most important strategic projects in the time ahead, as we expect it to provide cheaper and environmentally friendly heating to the citizens of Velika Gorica.”
CROSCO has been contracted by the Croatian Hydrocarbon Agency to carry out all phases of well construction.
With strengthening government and funding support, Croatia is positioning itself to take advantage of a particularly high geothermal gradient and perhaps one of the biggest geothermal potential in Europe. This week, Croatia will be holding its first-ever Geothermal Forum in Zagreb.

Held in the center of Europe’s financial sector, the event will be focusing on important elements of investing in geothermal energy development, such as market overviews, investor perspectives, project opportunities and funding schemes.
Despite the potential of geothermal to play a crucial role in Europe’s heating transition, the pace of development still falls shorts of what could be achieved. A key challenge troubling project developers is the rising investment cost, coupled with relatively high exploration risks.
Tackling financial challenges
We believe that major challenges can only be effectively addressed through productive exchanges between key stakeholders. Once again, the goal of IGC Invest is to bring together diverse perspectives—from municipalities, project developers, and industry players to banks and investors. This multifaceted approach sheds light on key challenges, showcases existing solutions, and fosters the development of new strategies.
#### What to expect from the event
The IGC Invest 2025 will feature exciting current projects and their innovative financing models, such as Innargi and Innovative Energie Pullach. Another notable participant is Amperland Thermalwärme, which is pioneering the integration of geothermal energy into a waste incineration plant.
Beyond project financing, the event will shift perspectives to investors, including Baseload Capital, and later to banks such as the RaboBank.
Additionally, we will explore ways to improve cost efficiency, particularly in drilling, construction, and operation. A key company featured in this segment is OMV. Lastly, we’ll look toward the future, examining how lithium extraction from geothermal brines could enhance project profitability.
#### Focus on discussion and networking
To ensure a dynamic exchange of ideas, IGC Invest is structured around short forums with input presentations, followed by interactive discussions. A key highlight of the event is our networking evening, offering participants an opportunity to engage in meaningful conversations while enjoying a breathtaking view of the Frankfurt skyline, courtesy of our premium sponsor Hogan Lovells.

“A central component of our theory of systemic change at Project Innerspace is the conviction that leveraging the technologies, capabilities, speed, and scale of the oil and gas industry is necessary to grow geothermal into a thriving global powerhouse. Indeed, should the oil and gas industry engage in geothermal at scale, it would be transformational for global economic growth, stability, and prosperity,”Jamie Beard
“It is our ambition as we build on this collaboration that we shift the massive potential of geothermal from the abstract into high impact reality. It’s time to get boots on the ground.”
The tool in use throughout the collaboration – GeoMap – was developed by Project Innerspace with the support of a global team of more than 100 researchers and scientists, and is hosted on Google Earth Engine. The tool also leverages Google Cloud’s scalable infrastructure, BigQuery, and Vertex AI.
GeoMap integrates diverse datasets, allowing users to visualize and analyze geothermal potential across different regions, effectively pinpointing promising locations for development. By combining Project Innerspace’s mapping technology, SLB’s geothermal expertise, and Google Cloud’s powerful computing resources, the collaboration aims to simplify the process of identifying, developing, and deploying geothermal energy solutions globally.
“This collaboration paves the way for widespread geothermal deployment on a global scale and will help meet future energy needs,”Kyle Jessen“By bringing Project Innerspace’s GeoMap, built on Google Cloud’s AI and data technologies, and SLB’s expertise in geothermal energy, businesses will have access to the tools and experience needed to grow geothermal energy programs around the world.”

A groundbreaking ceremony has been held for the Laufzorn II geothermal heating plant to be built by local utility EWG announced back in 2022.
With an exceptional increase in demand in Grünwald for geothermal heating, EWG set in motion the plans to expand their geothermal heating capacity. The utility has so far already completed work on a new 5-kilometer stretch of district heating pipeline. Part of the project is the drilling of a new doublet to a depth of around 4000 meters. This is expected to start by the spring of 2025.
Construction of above-ground facility will then proceed by 2026, looking towards a start of supply to the district heating network by the 2027/2028 heating season. Once Laufzorn II is in operation, Grünwald will achieve maximum independence in terms of heat supply and independence from fossil fuels.
The project is set to receive EUR 62.3 million of funding from the Federal Ministry of Economics. The municipality will also be investing an additional ~EUR 150 million.
“I would like to thank our partners who have supported us so successfully so far and who will accompany us in the next important steps. I would especially like to thank Erdwerk, the geology planning office, Anger, which will carry out the deep drilling, Pfaffinger, which is responsible for building the drilling site, and last but not least the planning team from Drees & Sommer,”
“Together we are expanding what is already the largest geothermal district heating network in Central Europe and creating value for the future. Good luck to all of us!”

Construction on the expansion and renovation of the geothermal plant in Svartsengi remains almost on schedule despite significant delays in light of six volcanic eruptions in Reykjanes in almost a year, as announced by The groundbreaking for the project was held in December 2022, and the planned commissioning is at the beginning of 2026.
The expansion project aims to increase the generation capacity of Svartsengi without having to drill additional wells. Thus, the focus is on the renovation and replacement of older equipment. Svartsengi 7 will increase the total production capacity of the Svartsengi geothermal field to 85 MWe. Two older power plants will be decommissioned when the new one comes into use. It is also hoped that the renovations will result in lower maintenance costs in the futures.
Despite the healthy progress in Svartsengi, the Icelandic Government has nevertheless commissioned Iceland GeoSurvey to identify locations for the drilling of new wells for emergency heat supply.
The geothermal power plant in Svartsengi is the first mixed geothermal power plant in Iceland, producing electricity, hot water, and cold water. The power plant was built in six phases over thirty years, and the first part was commissioned in 1976.

As reported locally, the Nevis Island Administration for the Caribbean Island state of St. Kitts & Nevis, recently provided an update on the geothermal development ambitions for the Nevis geothermal project.
The Honourable Mark Brantley, Premier of Nevis and Minister of Energy, and a great proponent for geothermal devleopment has said that despite past challenges, it is now targted to finalize the bidding process for drilling early in 2025.
A tender has been shared with drilling contractors both inter-regional and international, who were shortlisted to bid for the project. A return of those document is expected in February 2025. A first round of bidding brought no bids that met the requirements set by the government.
In January, there will be site visits by prospective bidders, pre-bid meetings etc to address questions and concerns by those invited bidders.
Funding, so Premier Brantley, has been secured for the drilling by the Caribbean Development Bank in partnership with the Inter-American Development Bank. The Green Climate Fund has also been mentioned. But overall financing also for the construction of the plant and grid updates has also been secured, so the article.

A video published on the
Although EDC had already been using drones since 2016 for documentation, they had only more recently used more advanced drone technology for the inspection of pipelines and transmission towers. This has allowed the company to better streamline their operations, allowing for more regular inspection while reducing workload and improving workplace safety.
EDC had recently augmented the generation capacity of the BacMan geothermal field with a new 28.9-MW binary power plant.
#### Faster and safer inspection
With about 40 kilometers of pipeline being utilized to support the 209 MW of installed geothermal power generation capacity at the BacMan site, manual inspection using handheld thermal cameras takes plenty of time and is very resource-intensive. It also exposes personnel to hazards like high elevations, steep terrain, and having to be in proximity of very hot (up to 170 °C) steam lines.
However, pipeline inspection is critical for maintaining the optimal operations of the geothermal facility. Pipelines can corrode, leading to degradation of the insulation, heat loss, and leaks. These leaks can reduce power output. At worst, leaks can aggravate and result in pipe explosions. Through thorough and consistent inspection, such risks can be mitigated early.
The use of a drone for inspection has allowed EDC to optimize their operations and streamline their workflows. The drone can operated remotely, is housed in a weatherproof dock, and can fly autonomously based on pre-set waypoints. Inspection of all 40 kilometers of pipeline, which will take years if done manually, can now be done in just days.
Check out the video below to learn more about how EDC is leveraging advanced drone technology to improve geothermal operations at the BacMan site in the Philippines.

The
The project involved an investment of EUR 5.4 million to incorporate the latest energy-efficiency technologies into the facilities. The wellbores are connected to pumps installed inside the building that raise or lower the temperature of the water flowing through the school’s underfloor heating or cooling system, depending on the time of year.
The geothermal system is complemented by an aerothermal system, both of which are powered by photovoltaic panels. The result is a highly efficiency system that reduces both energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions.
The Complutense Institute in Alcalá offers compulsory secondary education and baccalaureate to more than 800 students. The completed project here is part of a wider campaign by the Community of Madrid to carry out renovation and energy efficiency in eight public schools in the region. These projects will entail a total investment of EUR 28.7 million over 2023-2026, and will lead to a reduction of at least 30% in non-renewable primary energy consumption.

The exploration permit is specifically for “Kiel and Surroundings.” This permit area covers just over 280 square kilometers and includes the state capital, the Kiel Fjord, and adjacent areas between Strande in the north, Klein Barkau in the south, Melsdorf in the west, and Dobersdorf in the east.
Innargi had previously signed an agreement with local utility
“We are delighted to have been granted the geothermal exploration license for Kiel and the surrounding area. This enables us to progress together with Stadtwerke Kiel to potentially develop a geothermal project. We anticipate the subsurface will be favourable for hydrogeothermal, hence it could turn out to be a stable and secure energy source for the city of Kiel,”
The city utility have welcomed this development, but also emphasized that their current focus is another heating project.
“We are pleased that Innargi GmbH has received the exploration license for geothermal energy for the area “Kiel
“However, we are maintaining our letter of intent with Innargi for a potential future project.”

Preparatory work has started on the expansion of the capacity of the geothermal heating facility of
As announced in 2023, the expansion project will receive over PLN 52 million (approx. USD 11.9 million) of funding from the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management. The scope of the capacity expansion project includes drilling of the Banska PGP-7 production well to a target depth of 4000 meters. Thermal waters at 85 °C are expected to be tapped at this depth. This will be the fourth production well in the Banska field.

The investment also involves the construction of a pipeline, the purchase and installation of four heat exchangers, the construction of cooling towers, and the expansion of the heating network and connections. In total, the expansion project will require a total investment of PLN 108.5 million (approx. USD 27.5 million).
Established in 1993, the Geotermia Podhalanska heating company is 90.99% owned by the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management. Geothermal supplies about 40% of the total heating requirement in Zakopane.

A joint venture of OMV Green Energy and Energie Steiermark to develop a 140 MWth geothermal project for district heating in Graz, Austria.

In a city council meeting in mid-December 2024, the city of Graz in Austria unanimously approved a binding decarbonization plan for the district heating supply. This has also been now been set up as binding within the Board of Directors of local energy company
An elementary part of the decarbonization plan is the development of a geothermal heat project with a targeted heat generation capacity of 140 MWth and an expected eyar heat supply of 400-500 GWh. With a current heat demand of 1,365 GWh for the whole greater Graz area, with 1,160 GWh for the city itself it is expected that demand will grow to 1,400 GWh for 2030 and up to 1,500 GWh for 2040.
Interesting are then the concrete plans with the project “Tiefengeothermie fuer Graz”. (deep geothermal for Graz).
The project targets the drilling of four doublets to a depth of 3,000 to 4,000 meters, as well as the 2 aquifer thermal energy storage reservoirs at doublette 3 and 4 at a depth of 700 to 800m.
The geothermal project is the most important single project for the decarbonisation plan of 2024 and would be crucial in reaching the 80% criteria for highly efficient heat.
A Pre-feasibility study was contracted in 2021 and has been an important first step.
For the project, Energie Graz Gmbh is now in negotiations on the following contracts:
* Framework contract with the joint venture of
* Heat Supply contract with the JV (OMV & Energie Steiermark)
* Power supply contract with the JV, and
* Contract for the offtake infrastructure with Energie Steiermark Waerme GmbH
For Energie Graz it is reported, that no significant investments are expected, the refinancing for the joint venture company will take place through the agreed price for the heat delivery to Energie Graz GmbH. OMV, together with Energie Wien is currently developing a geothermal project in Vienna, Austria and is also pushing geothermal development for heat in Germany.
Price discounts from the basis price are set up in the contract in the case of improved economics in the project development. These are envisioned if there is less demand for directional drilling or no superchrome 13 casing might be needed. Subsidies over EUR 6 million per doublette would also reduce the agreed on price. Price increases are excluded. With project success of a heat deliver of 500 GWh, for additional heat supply up to 625 GWh no remuneration is to be paid. For heat delivered beyond that there will be a large discount from the basis price.
Target of the first heat deliver from first doublette is 2030 with an (indicated) heat contract term of 40 years.

Despite its proven potential, geothermal energy struggles to scale. Regulatory hurdles, financing challenges, and industry awareness must align to drive growth.

The following is a guest post published by
#### What’s the hold-up?
A question which has long interested many geoscientists, is why is geothermal taking so long to gain traction at a larger scale than what it has to date achieved.
When I look at this question, I am not on some personal crusade to make geothermal huge. I am not sure that is where it will end up and do not presume so. I am however interested in where it can genuinely fit into the energy toolbox. One tool amongst many in the repertoire. I do think it does have potential to increase significantly from where it is. On inspection it is possible to recognise that as a vague statement, and I can only say that is deliberately so. A lot of variables are in play.
Most particularly, I am interested in why existing proven tried and tested technologies are not more widely adopted. The merits of new immature or developing technologies is a question well worth investigation but one I’m going to park – not because it isn’t worthwhile to ask, but because of the time element involved.
If something is a new technology, it takes longer to prove up in a way that is “ready to roll” and relevant for a project that an investor wants to take forward quickly, now. There are more risks involved, be they technical or commercial in nature, or both. An R&D development pilot project is something that requires a whole different and rarer type of investor, and that is a story for another day. A lot of exciting stuff is happening and great, but meanwhile there is an important “yet…”.
Of the things we see widely deployed already, some of which have been shown to work for over a century, why is not take-up larger? This is a question I feel genuinely motivated to help with, and not because I have some financial involvement in a specifically geothermal company, I don’t. I wish to help those places which have underutilised resource, to put it to better use. I fully believe there are quite a few of those, without it necessarily “changing the world”. It doesn’t have to do that to still be happily useful to a lot of players.
#### Lots of moving parts
My perception (and there are contrasting ones available!) is simply that geothermal is something that has a lot of moving parts that all need to synchronise sufficiently for decent progress to be made in any one place. Before discussing that though, it is probably worth stressing that there is also lack of awareness of how much there is happening already.
If – as mentioned above – we focus on the “conventional” already widely adopted technologies, there are three broad categories of geothermal use:
1. Geothermal with heat pumps
2. Geothermal direct use heat
3. Geothermal power
Where geothermal is hot enough to deliver power, there can sometimes be option to combine the above.
In terms of energy delivery today, each of these roughly speaking, split about 1/3 each – though it is worth stressing that power is a different product to heat. To compare them in energy terms is a bit like comparing apples with pears. But just as a loose approximation, it’s not too far-off to say 1/3 geothermal heat pumps, 1/3 direct use heat, and 1/3 power.
![]( of the Tauhara geothermal power plant in New Zealand, May 2023 (source: Video screenshot, Contact Energy)
So while it is the geothermal power that so often occupies public and general awareness, and which does typically have some geographical limitations on where conventional technologies can be practically applied – it is the much more widely geographical available uses for heat that provide roughly 2/3 of the utilised geothermal energy. In terms of the actual number of projects and drilling – they are vastly more than that, because power projects are typically bigger and so their contribution is supplied by fewer projects. Something of the order of a few hundred wells per year, in contrast to the many thousands that supply the heat.
Now I have used the term geothermal heat pumps, and there is a nuance of a distinction to be had technically, in distinguishing purely “ground sourced” heat pumps that utilise mainly solar energy diffused into the top 20m of the ground, and “geothermal” heat pumps that go deeper than that, which utilise truly geothermal heat, in a strict sense. For the sake of simplicity, I’m not going to worry about that distinction. The reality is that the statistics available rarely differentiate it anyway, so any desire to distinguish is stymied even if we wanted to.
Suffice to say that what heat pumps do, is enable us to “condense” heat from lower temperatures, to elevate those temperatures – but they need a bit of power to do so, and some spend to put them in place. Direct use heat by contrast, works with the temperatures that nature gives us and deploys them directly, as the name suggests.
#### Who are the customers?
So it is always the first question to understand isn’t it – who wants to use what is available? And scaling something up is possible to achieve through many routes, lots of small, or few very big, middling amounts of medium, or of course, a mixture of all the above. Without going into laborious detail, the key customers for geothermal energy fall into a number of different categories:
* Medium to big customers that want heat – for industry, or district heating, or horticulture & agriculture.
* Small residential and commercial customers that want heat, typically but not only for space or water heating. Noting that cunning use of evaporative cooling methods can also use heat to make cool these days, and that cool can be a useful by-product of heat pump provided heat.
* Big customers that want power, either for a big industrial/commercial facility, or for distribution into a grid.
Although there is a developing market at suitable locations for brine minerals available in geothermal fluids such as silica or lithium, I will for the moment put that in the newer, rather than conventional category. There are no doubt examples that deviate from the three characterisations above, but they dominate a large part of geothermal use today.
#### What’s the hit list of requirements for a “conventional” geothermal “thunderbirds are go?”
So, armed with these very basic introductions to the nature of the existing technology geothermal market, what is the list of “moving parts” that need to be in place for it to gather momentum?
1. A compilation of existing case studies that can provide assurance in detail to customers that what they are contemplating doing is not so very wild after all. Sometimes in places where deployment is newer and unusual, that might involve resort to case studies from other places that are most similar, in the contexts of most interest and/or concern to the customer.
2. A regulatory environment that is comfortable with geothermal resource and clear on ownership and other legal issues.
3. Geoscientific, drilling and facility engineering expertise that is readily available not just to install but to help maintain projects operationally for their full life. Expertise that has history of working on geothermal projects of the type proposed. In places where such deployment is newer, that might involve the complementary assistance of internationally operating experts for some aspects – until such time as local expertise can be trained and readily, steadily available.
4. Clarity on the nature and likelihood of risks involved where they are indeed present, and an array of recognised mitigation strategies that will vary in nature with the type of customer and resource. It might involve insurance, or state assistance, or shared risks in multiple projects, or for the right kind of investor simply assurance from available relevant case studies that the risk is small.
5. A regional working database that is fit for purpose for a good start, to enable any new project to “hit the ground running”. If every project has to start with a new and time consuming regional & local resource evaluation stage, it is a sure killer for those who want to move quickly. There needs to be some sense of a pre-existing “on the shelf” national database that can effectively be put to use quickly, with some local embellishment, to facilitate speed against competing options. There are some misconceptions about what an effective database looks like, and we will talk to that separately. Such a database will typically have some free front-end and some pay-for deeper level, but the pre-requisite is that the data available is adequate to help kick-start real projects. The existence of such a database requires a pre-emptive investment in its creation from some larger player – typically state – appreciative of the longer-term reward involved in doing so.
6. An awareness of the customers – big and small – in broad terms – of the existence of the option. This includes awareness within the specific industries or other big commercial and state players – of the geothermal options that most typically characterise existing usages. Also awareness of where to find relevant expertise for first “scoping” evaluation in their local area, as all the options competing with geothermal are first considered. Such awareness should ideally also include ways that geothermal can be integrated with other resources as a great bonus without necessarily having to be the “whole answer”.
7. A financier and insurance community that equally has some awareness of the topic, as per point 6. That includes an awareness of the differences in cashflow timing with other types of energy investment.

So seven things. It might not seem at first glance that many to assemble. In practice though each one of these is far from trivial. Many, many places have a subset of that seven maturing well, but the number of places that have them all “well-oiled” for every aspect are few.
Particularly for all of the three broad applications – geothermal heat pumps, geothermal direct use heat, and geothermal power. Some might be going “great guns” on one of these, without really having fully embraced the other two. It is in the recognition of opportunity from all three, on all seven of these levels that geothermal truly reaches its full potential against competing options – whatever that final “position” might be.
It has been my experience that many institutions and teams are in fact addressing many aspects of each of these items diligently, proficiently, and expertly in many places. But simply put, until all the items on the list are assembled and pulling together, the inertia to overcome for new projects is large.
#### The database to assemble
I don’t want this to be an unduly technical article, so it is not the intention to go into a lot of detail here on the finer aspects of conventional geothermal projects. Three things I would like to stress though, include:
* The differentiation of static data from dynamic data, and inclusion of the latter.
* The importance of customer research.
* The importance of competing-option research.
Static vs dynamic data
What do I mean by static and dynamic? Well I need to frame that first. There are a lot of ongoing discussions about newer deep geothermal applications which don’t depend on the utilisation of hot water or steam naturally present in the ground. Many of the conventional shallower geothermal heat pump applications equally don’t require use of this “natural” “in-the ground” water, and for them the static data works well. But there are many that do rely on it and which need more.
Conventional deep geothermal applications often depend on using the hot water which is present naturally in the ground, and circulating it within the ground, and to the surface, and back again, after it has cooled. Ultimately we extract heat in these deeper (let’s for now say > 400m) conventional geothermal applications by cooling rock which has intrinsic permeability. That cooling is to some extent replaced by the earth’s natural heat flow, at a rate specific to a location and its geological character.
The heat we can get from a deep geothermal well in these situations is not just a function of temperature, it depends just as much on physically how much water we can extract from the underground reservoir. Unless we want geothermal power, which does have some practical temperature thresholds for commercial application, heat pumps empower us to utilise lower temperatures, if we have enough water coming from underground. They “condense” – in a loose sense – that lower temperature heat from big volumes into higher temperature heat.
It’s no good in these situations to have high temperature and no permeability. What we get might be hot, but we might not have enough of it. Now other technologies in development for deep geothermal are looking to see just how commercial some “workarounds” to that can be, but as said earlier, that’s a whole other story and I’m parking those for now. Why? Parked as not being readily accessible to those who have a project they want to move with quickly tomorrow, on timescales competitive against the other options customers have.
What all this means, is that for many of these conventional geothermal projects, what we want to know, is how water is naturally moving around in the subsurface, and how quickly it can be extracted from it. Not only that, but the perturbations to the system that exploiting it creates. That involves appreciating the forces controlling fluid flow in a basin, including hinterland rainfall, detailed rock structure, tectonic stresses, and it involves understanding how much any given well can produce. It is the data surrounding how things move, and how temperatures and pressures and volumes and chemistries change as function of each other, and as a function of time.
This kind of data is very empowering where it exists. It helps reveal how projects that rely commercially on how much hot water of a certain temperature is produced with time, can sustainably be flowed over a project lifetime.
![]( of the production and injection wells at the Utah FORGE site (source: Screenshot from Utah FORGE virtual tour)
This “dynamic” data is very different from “static” data. It is for a start much less widely shared. Precisely because it is much more useful, it is often deemed much more confidential by data owners. It is also genuinely trickier to handle. If you can imagine hundreds or even thousands of wells, all flowing with different temperatures, chemistries, pressures, and flow rate volumes, over some decades of well life, well instantly you get an appreciation of the amount of data that can be implied.
Sometimes though there is simply not the realisation present by the licensing and regulating bodies that they should be obliging organisations to release this data after some agreed, regulated time frame. This kind of data is immensely valuable to new project feasibility studies. That is not a call for authorities to get draconian in the data they require to be collected, as that can sometimes kill interest. Simply that what data is collected is ultimately shared on some agreed, regulated timeframe.
So what is the contrasting “static” data. Well it is things like the inferred temperatures at depth, at the time of first drilling. The type of rock, the porosity and permeability it has, the faults and fractures and geometries. The geochemistry of the water. The thermal conductivity of those rocks, and so on. This can tell us how much heat is “embedded” in the rock and fluid at depth. Data surrounding things that don’t move, and don’t change [so much] with time.
However it is the dynamic data that really tells us how much we can get to surface to use over a project lifetime, and what the impacts will be on any geochemical character. Yet commonly, vast efforts are undertaken to provide extensive static data sets in the belief that this alone empowers geothermal project activation. It doesn’t on its own. It is a necessary pre-requisite, but it is not on its own a sufficient condition. To truly take conventional deep geothermal to new levels requires an understanding of dynamic data in a region, or if genuinely in a new area, comparable analogues. That requires a concerted and specific effort to do so.
#### Customer research
It is actually a relatively simple yet often neglected aspect of regional geothermal database development, to recognise who the biggest customers might be, and where are they are. Furthermore, to map where awareness is generally good, and communities are naturally well-disposed to geothermal development. That might not be because of prior geothermal projects, it might reflect a locally greater awareness of things relating to the subsurface because of past mining or oil and gas activities, or simply just the idiosyncrasy of a local community that it “gets” it and likes it.
Communities are different. Part of this aspect is recognising where there are long-lived environmental or social heritages to preserve, and to understand that there will rightly be a more stringent case to answer in those areas.
So for starters, we can understand what the key industries are in an area, and which of them use a lot of heat, and which ones are either already overlying an existing resource, or would be amenable and flexible enough to commission new projects in the areas where good resource is. Cement plants, brick drying plants, big agricultural and horticultural operatives. Big food processing pants. Military installations or storage warehouses or transport hubs with big space heating needs. Hospitals or universities or big new residential developments. Especially those where there might be a district heating network established already but supplied with non-geothermal heat.
A quasi-obvious aspect of this customer requirement is understanding where and how often places get cold, how cold, and equally if cooling is on the agenda too, how hot and when.

Of course, part of this is full mapping of where the already existing geothermal customers are too, to know where the expansion story can be told most easily. It may surprise many to know where existing geothermal, especially shallow, low temperature, reservoir dependent geothermal for heat with heat pumps, is already being deployed with good effect – such as central London.
To my mind, if we exerted as much effort in approaching and corralling the industrial bodies of customers with a usage most well matched to geothermal – as we did to mapping static geological character – we would be in a much better place. That’s not to say they are all going to fall head over heals in love with geothermal, but for some of them it will be a logical, sensible, and attractive option to at least evaluate alongside others. So often we are simply not even managing to get industries that far.
For those industries spending tens or hundreds of millions of pounds/dollars/euros on new facilities this is especially the case. There is a lot to gain when we consider the energy demands of such facilities over some decades.
#### Competing-option research
It is a feature of our time of transition that much trumpeting occurs of what is technically possible. Always though, the imperative is not to demonstrate what is technically possible, but what makes most commercial sense of all the options available. There is competition. That competition is just as much constantly evolving as all the geothermal options are. So there is a need, for any customer to be truly engaged in going forward, to demonstrate not only that geothermal is possible, but that it is the best option for them, where they are, over the timescale of a project life. Including comparison against all the other competing energy suppliers. For them 24/7 might not be the selling point we sometimes think it is, if it precludes making use of cheaper energy supplies when they are available. The market is changing.
Much of the groundwork for that competitor analysis is not that hard. We can know and map where wind, and hydroelectric, and solar resource has lots of potential already, and quickly get a rough idea of costs. We can know where fossil fuel based thermal power plants are located and where they are either at the start of their life, or their end. We can map where electrical grids are, where gross heat demand is, where existing district heating networks are, and where waste heat, incinerators or biomass heat options are located. We can identify where various types of energy storage might be viable. These things may sound basic, but a country can map and publicise such things relatively easily and instantly help focus where effort is best concentrated from a competitive standpoint.

Understanding the competition in this way is not merely a case of knowing where to avoid and not waste time. It is allows the more systemic thinking of how the various options can work together in a complementary approach. Now that always sounds nice, and in truth, the complexities on a commercial and engineering front of doing things together, itself has a “trickiness” that is often underestimated. Nevertheless, there are those places where things might genuinely work together, and this kind of research can help uncover those. Not least places where subsurface thermal energy storage might be feasible.
#### Wider strategic database imperatives
There has been a lot of discussion so far, about the merits of putting a good “empowering” geothermal database together. Yet any organisation, state or otherwise, that undertakes to do so is not going to simply out of the goodness of its heart. It will want a good story and business case as to why it is useful to do so amidst all the other demands on its purse. I’m not going to embark on that exercise here – I simply note that it has to be done. It can be. What I think is worth stressing here though, is that the kinds of database collation described here, have potential use that goes far beyond geothermal applications.
![]( temperature model from GeotIS (source: T. Agemar/ GeotIS)
There is in 2025 a wider strategic imperative for any country to know its subsurface well. This for reasons of various fluid storage, hydrogeological resource, mineral resource, as well as geothermal resource, and the interactions of all these with each other. There is no reason why any national geothermal database effort can’t be effectively coordinated with other resource requirements for the responsible management of ongoing national strategic goals. Such an effort is going to arrive eventually, it may as well start out how it means to continue.
#### Summary
The good news is that many key aspects of the conditions for effective geothermal deployments are being assembled as we speak.
The tougher message is that any condition that is not being assembled is essentially a barrier to wider scale up.
The list of seven below is unlikely to be exhaustive, and I fully expect others will think of other things to incorporate. However, I highlight them as a core focus of any significant expansion of conventional, mature technology geothermal deployment options, even as the more adventurous experiment with the newer, less mature technology options.
A core seven pre-conditions required for conventional geothermal up-scale:
1. Detailed case study analysis.
2. Defined and favourable regulatory/legal environment.
3. Experienced geothermal expertise – geoscience, drilling, facilities.
4. Risk identification with place and customer specific mitigation strategies.
5. Working national and regional databases of both static and dynamic data relevant to geothermal, coordinated with other database demands of strategic subsurface resources.
6. Customer awareness of the geothermal option and where to find relevant expertise.
7. Financier and insurer awareness as above.

The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process has been completed for the geothermal resource exploration and drilling project to be carried out by Vatan Organik Gübre Tarim Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. in Oluz Village, located in the Central district of Amasya Province of Türkiye. Following the evaluations conducted by the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization, and Climate Change, the project was granted a “No EIA Required” decision.
The studies, which will cover an area of 10.776 hectares, have revealed a 38 °C hot water source near Gözlek Village, according to research conducted by the MTA Geophysical Surveys Department. The source is believed to be connected to the Ezinepazar Fault, and the project plans to drill to a depth of 1,000 ±100 meters.

The Government of Chile has officially published Law No. 21,711, which improves Law No. 19,657 on Geothermal Energy Concessions, in the Official Gazette. The law seeks to facilitate the development of shallow geothermal energy uses by excluding them from the previous concession regime. With this publication, most of the provisions of the law have entered into force.
The full text of the law (in Spanish) can be accessed
The proposed law was approved by both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies of the Republic of Chile earlier this year. The new law primarily makes the development of shallow geothermal projects – defined by the law as being less than 400 meters depth and at temperatures below 90 °C – by removing the requirement for a geothermal concession for such projects to operate.
The law also creates a National Registry for Shallow Uses of Geothermal Energy. to be managed by the Ministry of Energy, where new and existing shallow geothermal operations will be compulsorily registered.
Aside from the provisions on shallow geothermal energy, the new law further modifies the Geothermal Law with the following provisions:
* Places the authority on supervision, regulations, and technical standards of the Geothermal Law into the Superintendence of Electricity and Fuels, thus consolidating authority into a singular body.
* Transfers the function of maintaining the registry of geothermal concessions to the Ministry of Energy.
* Restricts groundwater use rights granted by the Geothermal Law to geothermal concessionaires to water necessary only for exploration and exploitation work.
* Mandates the Ministry of Energy to issue regulations establishing general safety standards for the utilization of geothermal energy, including measures to prevent and control risks to life, health, and safety of people, safeguarding the sustainability of the geothermal resources, and protecting facilities and infrastructure.
Regulations on shallow geothermal energy use and safety must be issued within 18 months of publication of the law. These regulations shall then come into force upon publication on the Official Gazette.
Several shallow geothermal projects are currently under development under Chile, many of which are under the leadership of

There are two project sites being targeted – the 20-MW Wapsalit geothermal site in Buru Island, and the 2×10 MW Tulehu geothermal site in the Ambon Island.
“So when there are old generating machines, which are diesel, they are immediately replaced with Renewable Energy (EBT), as a form of the Government’s concern to provide EBT as an international consensus,”
Based on 2024 data, the total power generation capacity in the Maluku region has reached 409 MW. About 249 MW of this comes from diesel power plants, followed by gas-based power plants at 157 MW. The contribution of renewables, via solar and hydroelectric power plants, is minimal at only 3 MW.
“With the inclusion of the geothermal power plant (PLTP) project into the RUPTL of PT PLN, the Government wants to significantly boost the use of New and Renewable Energy in the Maluku region and reduce the dominance of fossil energy which has so far dominated the electricity system in the region,”
The Wapsalit prospect is currently in the exploration stage and has an expected COD by 2028. Tulehu, on the other hand, is a site that has had a long history of surface surveys and exploration drilling, with results from the wells decidedly not meeting the expectations for the project.

The practice of geothermal exploration is replete with challenges, some of which may be unique to a specific project site. However, it cannot be argued that they are invaluable in subsurface characterization and pinpointing high-potential sites for drilling.
In this guest article by
The success of a recent 3D seismic survey in Western Switzerland underlines the importance of high-quality seismic data for geothermal exploration. This pilot project around the town of Eclépens in the canton of Vaud could show a more secure and efficient path to developing geothermal energy and increasing the impact geothermal energy has on the green energy market.
#### Precision exploration tools as an enabler for geothermal growth
Global interest in geothermal energy for both heat and electricity is rapidly increasing. 88 countries currently produce heat from geothermal sources and 29 countries have geothermal electricity plants (Geothermie Swiss, 2024), however the impact that geothermal energy has on the total energy market is minimal.
Identifying potential geothermal resources and pinpointing optimal exploratory drilling locations remains the challenging dimension to successful geothermal exploitation. Multiple abandoned attempts to harness geothermal energy can be linked to lack of knowledge of the subsurface which results in wasting time and money and diminishing public support for future projects.
Careful planning and implementing of detailed seismic surveys in the early stages of geothermal projects gives the crucial insight needed for stakeholders to advance confidently with real data in hand to support decision-making. This is acutely important in Europe where geothermal exploration and development has particular constraints linked to dense urbanisation, strict government permitting, and often strong local community objections.
Europe is still heavily dependent on gas, oil and nuclear power to reach its increased winter energy demands that cannot be entirely covered by the intermittent energy supplied by wind or solar. Geothermal solutions exist to fill this gap, linking in with existing local energy providers and district heating projects. These projects are reliant, however, on finding geothermal reservoirs with precise conditions and properties adapted to energy production. With recent advances in seismic technology, high-resolution, dense seismic surveys are helping kick-start future geothermal projects all over Europe, providing a lower-cost method for acquiring a high-quality image of the subsurface.
A Case Study in Eclépens, Western Switzerland
Much of the Swiss plateau has been earmarked for its geothermal potential. While the regional geology is well known, there are very few areas that have been subject to detailed subsurface investigations. Potential medium depth geothermal targets in the sedimentary layers of the Molasse basin are intersected by zones of faults, fractures and shearing which were created as sedimentary layers in the Swiss plateau were pushed up against the Jura mountains.
Understanding the amplitude and orientation of faults, fractures, and geological features, as well as specific properties affecting geothermal brine flow and temperature, such as porosity and permeability, is essential for planning well location and trajectory. Detailed geological modelling using high -resolution, 3D seismic surveys combined with existing well log data and surface geology features, is an essential tool for interpreting the subsurface and planning geothermal projects.
In the search for potential geothermal resources, the area around Eclépens, in the canton of Vaud was selected as a target survey area after strong geothermal indicators were detected in the 1981 Eclépens-1 well (M. Baykulov et al., 2024). An unusually high geothermal gradient was detected in the well, with temperatures above 100 °C at depths of 2000m, which indicates a potential geothermal resource that could provide not only energy for district heating systems but also geothermal electricity production. Legacy 2D seismic survey data already existed in the area but did not provide enough detail for accurate planning and execution of preliminary geothermal well placement.

#### The survey proper
The survey includes 3 major stages:
1. Planning and Permitting
A thorough planning and permitting stage was carried out to ensure a consequent smooth and rapid acquisition process. This results in lower impact to the community and environment, higher efficiency and therefore lower costs. As well as receiving all required licensing and permits from the local and regional authorities, the contractors worked with private, agricultural and industrial landowners to facilitate land access during the acquisition process.
Diligent planning of the seismic source and receiver layout was undertaken to achieve optimal coverage of the area and preserve the density of the acquired traces. A theoretical, preliminary grid layout was designed taking in consideration the tectonic fault lines described in earlier, regional models and oriented so that the fault lines could be optimally imaged (M. Baykulov et al., 2024). This theoretical grid was then significantly adjusted to real-life conditions using GIS software to account for obstacles in the landscape and no-permit zones.
The seismic acquisition contractor,
STRYDE has developed a streamlined node, small enough to fit in the palm of your hand and stripped of redundant components. These small, lightweight receivers enabled the survey to be conducted with minimal impact to the environment and local community because of the reduced equipment burden and the ease of deployment on foot or with smaller vehicles. The use of lightweight, cable-free nodes also increases trace density as the number of nodes deployed is easily increased around obstacles or target areas with little change to acquisition time or team size.

1. Seismic Survey Acquisition
A total of 21,475 individual STRYDE autonomous nodes were deployed by Geo2X at the Eclépens site over 11 days following the pre-planned orthogonal source and receiver grid layout. The area was split into four team quadrants with one vibroseis truck working in each quadrant. Careful attention was applied to the distance between sources (to avoid interference) and the vibration levels in proximity to buildings (as per the Swiss regulations).
The simplicity of STRYDE nodes and their consequent recording reliability and robustness results in minimal field quality controls. These nodes have precise time synchronization and GNSS positioning and have done away with redundant and unnecessary capabilities that relay live information to the field team during the survey – a hangover from the days of fragile, cabled systems and sparse survey spacing where any data gaps were an impediment to survey results.
The reliability of the STRYDE nodes means that, once deployed and synched, they do not need to be tracked in the field. In contrast, seismic receivers that relay data to the field team in real-time are more expensive, bulkier, need more battery life and have more components susceptible to malfunction. In the Eclépens survey, 99% of data was recovered from the STRYDE nodes (M. Baykulov et al., 2024) and material loss or damage was minimal.
Preliminary assessment of the data can be carried out when the nodes are harvested or redeployed. Data QCs can be performed on preliminary data sets using specialized, on-site software components. STRYDE’s streamlined node harvesting systems and unique in-field software processing tools allow for rapid turnover of node acquisition and deployment and a reliable first look at data while operations are continuing. This process has replaced the redundant, in-field QC process of bulky real time geophones which gave limited, positioning information and reflection data without any processing capabilities.
To achieve the high channel count required for dense, 3D, urban surveys, large numbers of receiver nodes need to be deployed across often complicated urban areas. The risk of receivers being lost, damaged or tampered with is higher in urban areas and can result in incomplete data sets or added delays and cost increases to the project, this is regardless of real-time QC or tracking seen on bigger and more costly geophone systems.
STRYDE is known for its low node loss record, with very small numbers of deployed nodes missing through tampering, theft or damage. The compact size of the STRYDE node allows it to be easily buried or hidden and therefore not obvious to passersby. The node loss count for the Eclépens survey was less than 2 % and did not impact data continuity. The small size of the nodes also means that they are highly mobile, easily carried on foot with streamlined deployment and retrieval using smaller crew sizes. This flexibility was beneficial in a survey area like Eclépens with complicated mixed-purpose urban and agricultural areas and limited heavy vehicle access.

1. Data Processing, Interpretation and Well Placement
Fast-track processing of the acquired data sets gave an early overview of the quality of the data and enabled comparisons to the regional macro-structures and the legacy 2D data sets. The data went through preliminary conditioning techniques which include noise reduction, signal enhancement, and correction for any data inconsistencies. This ensures that the data sets are of the highest quality before further, more sophisticated processing.
A first-look, comparative analysis of pre-STM data imaging already showed the enhanced detail of the 2023 3D data set, compared with the vintage 2D seismic images with reduced seismic noise, less chaotic signatures and more continuity in reflectors. Comparison of the NW-SE linear 2D line with an identical spatial line from the new data showed the lack of continuity in seismic reflectors of the 2D data and an overall chaotic signature (M. Baykulov et al., 2024).
![]( of the vintage 2D line acquired in the 1970s (left) to the preliminary PreSTM product from Eclépens 3D result (right) (source: M. Baykulov et al., 2024).
Common urban obstacles such as roads and buildings limit the acquisition of straight line 2D seismic. 3D surveys, however, can combine information from all directions with many different source-receiver combinations which can work around obstacles or voids in the survey area. Given the high volume and density of the data, data gaps can also be compensated by advanced interpolation techniques during data processing.
Thanks to the high resolution of the seismic signal obtained in the Eclépens survey, a series of sophisticated data processing techniques were applied to the dataset in order to produce a more complete and accurate seismic model of the area. These techniques include, for example, Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI), Common Reflection Angle Migration (CRAM), rock property inversion and Reverse Time migration (RTM) which help to further refine the seismic image and enhance subsurface characterisation.
By integrating the processed seismic survey data with existing well log data, detailed and accurate 3D geological models can be produced. The final models are key project management tools that are essential to decision making for well location, trajectory, depth etc. These models provide the best possible estimation of the target resource and are key in supporting all aspects of geothermal projects, from planning to engineering, mitigating risks and project cost reduction.
#### Conclusions
The benefits of high-density, 3D seismic surveys have already been extensively exploited in other industries such as petroleum, nuclear waste storage, mineral exploration, etc. The Eclépens case study shows how seismic reflection surveys can be performed to high industry standards, with high-quality data sets and streamlined operational performance, while keeping acquisition costs low enough to benefit the renewable energy industry.
These surveys add real value to geothermal exploration projects by bringing more clarity to the subsurface and aiding decision-making. High-resolution geological models from dense 3D geophysical surveys are the most robust tools available to evaluate the target resource and plan well locations and trajectories.
Through a combination of thorough and diligent planning and permitting stages along with advanced seismic acquisition technology such as the STRYDE receiver node, it is now possible to bring high-density, 3D surveys to the geothermal market.

Sanjeev Kumar, EGEC’s Policy Director, added that “excluding geothermal from the tripartite agreements initiative is counter-productive.”
The European geothermal industry has long called for a geothermal action plan that sets targets for geothermal growth in Europe and provides support in the areas of support schemes, permitting, accessibility of data, and strengthening of innovations. This call had then been echoed by the European Council.
Energy ministers, the European Parliament, the Committee of Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee and even Dan Jorgensen, the Commissioner for Energy and Housing had already committed to a geothermal action plan, which today is yet to be delivered.

Following a series of surface surveys and evaluations done since 2017, exploration drilling at three sites in the Seulawah Agam Geothermal Working Area (WKP) in Aceh Besar, Indonesia can proceed by 2025. This was indicated by Edwil Suzandi, Director of Exploration and Developemnt of
The partnership between the two parties was signed back in 2017, after PGEO won the tender for the Seulawah Agam site.
The Seulawah Agam geothermal site has potential of up to 320 MW based on initial studies. Supplementing this updates, PGEO and PEMA have done geoscience surveys and geohazard mapping at the site, with conceptual model updates reported in 2022-2024. Edwil stated that the further studies provided strong technical basis to proceed to exploration drilling.
If developed, the Seulawah Agam project will be the first geothermal power plant in the Aceh region of Indonesia. The project is currently at the land acquisition stage. With the drilling sites already identified, the next step would be to build access roads to support logistics and operations. The project partners are planning to start drilling in 2025.
Edwil also stated gratitude for the support of the Aceh Government and local institutions and communities for the project. “We will continue to work with all stakeholders, including local communities, at every stage of the development of this project.”
Acting Governor of Aceh, Safrizal, also reaffirmed support for the project while also prioritizing the interests of the community and the environment.

This comes as part of the agenda to associate renewable energy development to regional revitalization, which is a priority plan of the cabinet under Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
A separate media disclosure indicates that the Japanese government will be establishing agreements between local administrative agencies, power companies, and local residents to facilitate geothermal project development. Such agreements aim to address persistent issues such as long development cycles and lack of local acceptance.
These measures will then be incorporated into Japan’s medium-term energy policy guidelines, which will be drafted by the end of 2024.
Despite an abundance of geothermal resources, Japan only has an installed geothermal power production capacity of 576 MW as of the end of 2023, ranking 1oth in the world. This accounts for less than 1% of the installed power capacity of Japan. The government hopes that, with these measures, geothermal power can reach 1% of the power mix in Japan and that hydroelectric power can reach 11%.

In an announcement, Ormat Technologies Inc. reports the signing of a 10-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Calpine Energy Solutions, one of North America’s largest energy suppliers. Under this agreement, Calpine Energy Solutions will purchase up to 15 megawatts (MW) of clean, renewable energy from the Mammoth 2 geothermal power plant located near Mammoth Lakes, California, to support demand within its retail portfolio.
It is planned to start delivering power under the PPA in the first quarter of 2027 and replace an existing PPA with Southern California Edison Company (SCE). The new PPA will include an increase in production capacity and this at a higher price point. It highlights the tight supply-demand balance of carbon-differentiated electricity in California, driven by state Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) compliance needs and voluntary corporate demand.
Sean Fallmer, President, Calpine Energy Solutions explained, “Now more than ever, it’s critical to have a robust network of strategic partners, like Ormat, that focus on alternative and renewable geothermal supply-side technologies that ensure our retail clients can procure customized, scalable energy strategies that are aligned to their unique cost, risk, and carbon goals.”
Doron Blachar, Chief Executive Officer of Ormat Technologies, commented, “We are excited to partner with Calpine Energy Solutions to provide them with reliable zero emission power from our Mammoth 2 geothermal facility. Under this agreement, Ormat will add up to 15MW of geothermal energy to Calpine Energy Solutions, reinforcing their commitment to further supporting their clients in reaching their sustainability goals. Ormat remains on track to meet its long-term targets for generation capacity growth in our Electricity segment. This new PPA with its significantly improved economics, underscores not only the robust growth in renewable power demand but also the market’s trust in our leading geothermal capabilities.”

The ARPA-E under the US DOE has announced a $30 million funding opportunity for research and development of technologies to harness superhot geothermal energy.
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
The
Concept papers for this funding opportunity need to be submitted by 19 February 2025
This program seeks to fund the development of novel technologies for well construction, enhance testing facilities, and optimize reservoir heat extraction to make super-hot geothermal production a reality. The program will have two categories:
1. Technologies related to the construction of robust super-hot wells and validation services for quality assurance of new well designs and materials. This focus will involve new materials, novel well solutions, and state-of-the-art testing facilities to assess these new approaches; and
2. Technologies related to the extraction of heat from the reservoir to the well. The focus of this category is to develop fracture based and non-fracture-based methods for extracting heat from a super-hot reservoir (potentially composed of ductile rocks) to a working fluid in a well.
The SUPERHOT program builds on ARPA-E’s history of support for enhanced geothermal projects. ARPA-E’s work in this area includes supporting industry leaders Fervo Energy, AltaRock Energy, and Eden Geopower. The funding opportunity announcement follows on last year’s RFI for novel approaches to superhot enhanced geothermal power.
“Geothermal is a reliable and secure baseload power source, but today we are only able to access a fraction of the energy it can provide,”“SUPERHOT projects can change that and allow access to hotter reservoirs to create more domestic flow of energy onto America’s grid.”

A new geothermal pilot plant has been opened in the small township of Järva County in Roosna-Alliku, Estonia. The pilot project draws heat from a field of boreholes, each drilled to slightly over 500 meters depth, and supplies it to the district heating network.
The project was carried out in collaboration with the
The Roosna-Alliku geothermal pilot project is part of the wider GEOENEST initiative by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications and implemented by the EGT. The goal of GEOENEST is to assess the potential of geothermal energy as a source for district heating solutions through several pilot solutions, each significantly different from the others.
Earlier this year, another pilot project under GEOENEST started operations in the Tiskre sub-district in Tallinn, which has successfully started supplying clean and sustainable heat to nearby apartment buildings. A third project planned under the program aims to supply heating and cooling from a 700 meter borehole, which will be the deepest geothermal borehole drilled in Estonia.

# What role will geothermal play in the energy transition of Saudi Arabia?
!What role will geothermal play in the energy transition of Saudi Arabia? What role will geothermal play in the energy transition of Saudi Arabia? (Inset image source:
![ ](
![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 4 Mar 2025
With a wealth of oil and gas experience, Saudi Arabia is uniquely positioned for geothermal development. But what will it take to turn potential to reality?
![](

![](
As one of the world’s biggest oil producers and the leading oil exporter, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia owes a great deal of its progress and wealth to the discovery and continued extraction of petroleum products. The nation’s power sector is also heavily reliant on hydrocarbons, which is hardly surprising considering its affordability and supply.
However, even an oil giant like Saudi Arabia is making changes towards a more low-carbon future. With an ambitious renewable energy target of 50% of its power supply by 2030, is there a prominent role for geothermal in Saudi Arabia’s energy mix?
To answer this, we examined
* Naceur Ghannem
* Osamah Al-Momen
* Mahmoud AlGaiar
#### Geothermal prospects and potential in Saudi Arabia
The classical geological characteristics that indicate potential for geothermal resources are clustered at the western region of Saudi Arabia. The “Harrat” volcanic field comprises over 2500 dormant volcanoes and many hot springs, with temperatures reaching 80 °C.
Early studies in the region indicate low-to-medium temperature gradients, with an exceptionally higher gradient in the Jizan area to the south. There has also been some early exploration done near Harrat Rahat that have hinted at potential “sweet spots” for geothermal energy. However, there is not enough analysis done to come up with accurate estimates of geothermal resources and reserves.
The eastern part of Saudi Arabia comprises the Arabian Platform, which are sedimentary formations that contain the nation’s hydrocarbon resources. Some of the oil and gas wells in this region have been able to tap into geothermal temperatures sufficient for various applications. Various synergies can also be explored, such as for hydrogen production and carbon capture and storage.
![]( geothermal features in Saudi Arabia (source: Lashin et al, 2020)
Aside from geothermal’s potential to supplement Saudi Arabia’s electricity grid, it can also contribute significantly to the nation’s cooling needs. Studies show that cooling consumes 101 TWh of electricity in residences and 70 TWh in commercial establishments, accounting for 50% of total yearly electricity usage. This figure can go up to 70% during periods of peak cooling demand.
In the Middle East region, a noteworthy example of geothermal used for cooling is already operational in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. This is a special case as it uses heat from deep geothermal wells to run an absorption cooling system. However, shallower geoexchange systems can provide a more practical and technologically simpler pathway for geothermal cooling in Saudi Arabia.
Geothermal can also supply both heat and power for the region’s water desalination plants. With a scarcity of freshwater, the region is highly dependent on desalination of seawater. This is an energy-intensive, yet highly critical, process. As a heat source, geothermal heat can be used directly in thermal desalination methods.
#### The current status of geothermal in Saudi Arabia
In 2020, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia announced a goal to generate 50% of its power from renewables by 2030, thus displacing 1 million barrels per day of liquid fuels. However, this goal states no preference when it comes to technology.
“Saudi Arabia is looking into multiple energy pathways, including conventional oil and gas. But they are also looking at cleaner energy and renewables, including solar and a little bit of wind. They are also looking at hydrogen as well. Geothermal is a new focus,”
As is with most parts of the world, geothermal in Saudi Arabia has not received as much attention as other renewable energy technologies. There remains a lack of understanding of geothermal, and there is limited awareness of its benefits. Available public data is not enough to create a robust assessment of the geothermal potential in the region.
On a positive note, there are already various exploration efforts for geothermal in Saudi Arabia. The most visible example would likely be the exploratory work being done at the which broke ground in early 2024. This is a pilot project that aims to use a relatively shallow (400 meters depth) geothermal well for reconnaissance, monitoring, and testing of new technologies. The project is led by KAUST Research Professor in Energy Resources and Petroleum Engineering Thomas Finkbeiner, with
Other exploration projects are less public, but there is nevertheless some interesting work ongoing in the geothermal space in Saudi Arabia.

From a revenue perspective, it is also beneficial for Saudi Arabia to develop a more diverse and optimized energy industry. “Energy in this region is subsidized by governments. As both the population and the industrial sector grow, there is also a higher demand for energy. Thus, that subsidy is also going to increase. So, governments have to look at ways to optimize the energy sector and look at alternatives. Geothermal can be one of those alternatives,”
#### The role of the oil and gas industry
With a rich history in oil and gas exploration and extraction, Saudi Arabia is uniquely positioned to leverage existing skills and technologies for geothermal development. Many technologies essential in geothermal, such as directional drilling and well stimulation, are already deployed in Saudi Arabia’s oil and gas sector.
During the opening ceremony of the International Petroleum Technology Conference, His Royal Highness Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al-Saud, the Minister of Energy, mentioned that state-owned petroleum company Saudi Aramco will be a key enabler in advancing geothermal at the rapid rate needed to meet energy diversification and climate goals. Given its extensive history of oil and natural gas exploration, Saudi Aramco has knowledge of the Kingdom’s geology more than any other entity in the geothermal field.
Saudi Arabia’s long history with oil and gas also means that the Kingdom has established long-standing relationships with service providers, many of which have a global footprint and experience in both oil and gas and geothermal. Baker Hughes is one such example.
“We have 40 years of experience in geothermal,”“Baker Hughes has been a part of a large number of geothermal projects, providing expertise in many areas including reservoir analysis, geomechanics, and tools for high pressure and high temperature environments. Our portfolio covers the whole value chain of geothermal project development.”
As Membership Chair of the SPE Geothermal Technical Section (GTTS) in the Middle East, AlGaiar also actively advocates for cross-industry collaboration, mobilizing oil and gas expertise to facilitate geothermal development. “We are trying to promote geothermal at every upcoming local conference, making sure that there is a dedicated panel for geothermal. We are making sure that geothermal is available at each conference and that there are geothermal topics that participants can submit papers for.

The SPE GTTS aims to aid geothermal development in the Middle East region through the collection, dissemination, and sharing of technical knowledge related to geothermal energy, while demonstrating its link to traditional oil and gas disciplines. Through collaboration between the two fields, the SPE GTTS is also promoting industry best practices via knowledge and skills transfer.
The repurposing of abandoned oil and gas wells presents another possible pathway for geothermal development in Saudi Arabia. Converting or enhancing depleted oil and gas wells into geothermal wells will help offset their abandonment costs while producing clean energy and extending the wells’ lifespans. Baker Hughes, as the leader of the Wells2Watts consortium, is already working on a closed-loop single-well technology designed specifically for this geothermal use case.
#### A pathway for geothermal energy in the Middle East
“Big companies would like to enter the market in Saudi Arabia,”“But currently there are no geothermal projects yet and the sector is only at the exploration phase.”
The geothermal sector of Saudi Arabia is currently at a very nascent phase, and there will have to be more investment put into research and drilling campaigns. It is also necessary to implement regulations and incentives to encourage businesses to introduce geothermal technologies to the market and streamline the adoption of these technologies.
The KAPSARC paper cites the example of the 2020 Saudi mining investment law. This law created a mining fund that supported exploration programs, research and studies, and mining-related infrastructure projects. A similarly enabling environment can help accelerate the deployment of geothermal by incentivizing exploration, investment, and research.
On the part of technology partners, Ghannem mentions three key pillars that can help support geothermal – technology, vision, and the motivation.
A positive sign of support for geothermal in the Kingdom is the multiple stakeholders seemingly taking ownership of various aspects of geothermal research and exploration. “KAUST is coming from the academia and technology side, KAPSARC is taking the lead in the policy side of things, and Saudi Aramco is taking the lead on the operational and execution side,”
“As Baker Hughes, we are also coming in from the service side. So, there are several stakeholders in the Kingdom that are pushing the geothermal agenda.”
“I am sure that, one day, geothermal in Saudi Arabia will move from exploration to appraisal,”“I think the motivation is there. We do have the development expertise and the technology here. We only need cooperation among researchers, investors, policymakers, and other stakeholders of the energy ecosystem.”
“I don’t believe that we are in an energy transition. Rather, what we need is an energy addition,”“We are in an industrial revolution and we are consuming a lot of energy for AI and data centres. The more that AI becomes essential in industries, the more power we will need.”
“Everyone is now investing in geothermal, including technology giants like Microsoft and Google. Geothermal will be there in the equation of energy, no matter what the main problem is. It is now underrated because of the high upfront cost, but if we can get the levelized cost of energy or heat that is competitive to other renewables, especially with the high capacity factor of geothermal, then it’s a win-win scenario.”

The city of Burghausen in Bavaria, Germany has signed a geothermal heat supply agreement with
Kirchweidach is the site of a geothermal project that produces electricity and supplies heat to the local community and a greenhouse operator, we have reported on before.
#### Expanding the Geothermal Network
Burghausen’s district heating system will undergo significant expansion in the coming years, beginning with the integration of the existing network in Burghauser Neustadt. The project aims to connect more residential and commercial properties to renewable geothermal energy, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and lowering CO2 emissions.
Background: Naturwärme Kirchweidach-Halsbach
The Naturwärme Kirchweidach-Halsbach initiative was founded as a joint project between the municipality of Kirchweidach and the company Gemüsebau Steiner. Initially, the geothermal plant in Halsbach was developed to provide sustainable heating to Kirchweidach and Steiner’s greenhouse operations.
However, due to the high thermal output of the well, surplus heat is now being made available to additional municipalities and businesses in the region. Recognizing the potential of geothermal district heating, Burghausen—through its energy subsidiary EBG (Energieversorgung Burghausen)—has taken the opportunity to integrate geothermal energy into its local heating infrastructure.
#### Project Timeline & Implementation
* Letter of Intent Signed – City officials and Naturwärme Kirchweidach-Halsbach representatives have formally agreed to build the pipeline and supply geothermal heat.
* Construction Start (2026) – The pipeline from Halsbach to Burghausen is expected to begin construction in 2026.
* Phased Expansion – Initially, an existing district heating system in Burghauser Neustadt will be connected, followed by a gradual rollout of a new district heating network across the city.
This expansion will enable thousands of residential units and businesses to switch to renewable geothermal heat, significantly reducing carbon emissions and strengthening regional energy independence.
With growing investment in geothermal district heating, Germany continues to advance sustainable energy solutions at the local level.

The
Interested firms will need to register at the World Bank’s RFx Now website to access the relevant documents. More details are available at
This announcement follows a previous story of the IFC signing an agreement with the Ministry of Economy and Commerce of Kyrgyzstan on the use of geothermal energy for heating and cooling, initially in the capital city of Bishkek.
The purpose of this assignment is to define the development of a pre-feasibility report that provides detailed analysis of the technical and economic factors important for the deployment of a utility scale (10,000-30,000 housing units) networked geothermal system in Kyrgyzstan. This work package will be instrumental in guiding any potential site selection and detailed engineering work that would be used to deploy the network as well as in the pursuit of funding sources to support the work.
The Consultant is expected to support IFC in proposing and assessing the overall feasibility of deploying networked geothermal systems in Kyrgyzstan.
The assignment will be to conduct an analysis across two feasibility metrics:
* Metric 1 will be technical feasibility. This will involve the review and analysis of the potential performance of a network of ground sourced heat pumps in Kyrgyzstan. This should be based on available documentation and information on the local geology, ground temperatures, drilling conditions, building stock, regulatory environment, and climate zone data. Specific attention should be given to an estimate of potential borefield performance in Kyrgyzstan and a review of any existing ground source heat pump systems currently in operation.
* Metric 2 will be economic feasibility. This will involve analysis of the potential economics of a networked geothermal deployment in Kyrgyzstan. Specifically, a review of the estimated installation costs for a district scale system that could serve on the order of 10,000-30,000 household equivalents. The analysis should also compare the costs for average customers to operate a ground source heat pump to existing costs for heating and cooling using traditional solutions. Any current subsidies for either heating or electricity will also be critical to this analysis in order to get a full picture of the overall performance vs cost.
International consultants or consultants located outside of the Kyrgyzstan, should have a local partner and the details should be included in the EOI.

Shallow geothermal energy specialist
This project is a new step for Celsius Energy that expands upon its presence in France and the United States.
Installed in just 10 months on an occupied site, the system includes 18 closed-loop inclined wells, associated with a geothermal heat pump controlled by a digital platform optimizing the energy performance of the installation in real time. With this new installation, the SLB Group now has three buildings converted to geoenergy, putting them in right track of achieving the group’s goal of decarbonizing all of its facilities by 2050.
Karen Spenley, UK Director of Celsius Energy, emphasizes that the demonstrator is a showcase of the benefits of their technology. _“? Our approach allows us to optimize system design, reduce the floor space required to conduct work and use digital tools to manage/ maximize performance. This allows us to make geothermal energy more accessible and affordable, including for sites with significant space constraints.” _
#### Geoenergy as an opportunity for the UK
The UK remains heavily dependent on gas for its electricity production (40%) and domestic heating (85%). Thus, geoenergy represents an important alternative for the country to attain its energy security and sustainability goals.
The new demonstrator site in Stonehouse affirms Celsius Energy’s to be a key player in the British geothermal market, particularly in dense urban areas. It is also a manifestation of the company’s commitment to helping companies and communities towards a more resilient and sustainable future.
“The UK’s geothermal potential is immense, but still largely untapped. Our presence here aims to fill this gap and support the country in its transition to renewable energy,”

Construction of the Te Mihi 2 geothermal power plant is part of Contact Energy’s GeoFuture initiative, which seeks to eventually retire the aging Wairakei power station. Subject to final investment decision, Contact Energy is also planning a second phase of development, Te Mihi Stage 3, which is expected to come online by mid-2031.
This significant agreement marks Ormat’s fourth large project in New Zealand currently under development and is expected to replace, in stages, the 1950’s-built Wairakei geothermal power station. It also highlights Ormat’s advantages in developing binary technology, which is also suitable for high enthalpy geothermal reservoirs.
Doron Blachar, Chief Executive Officer of Ormat Technologies, commented: “We are thrilled to partner with Contact Energy on this landmark geothermal project. The Te Mihi Stage 2 project is a testament to Ormat’s commitment to delivering cutting-edge geothermal solutions that drive the transition to clean energy. We expect that our year-end Product Segment backlog, once the contract is signed, will exceed $300 million and we will recognize the bulk of the revenues associated with this contract during 2026 and 2027.”
“The 101MW Te Mihi Stage 2 plant, along with the additional 160MW we are currently building in New Zealand, strengthens our position as market leader while also expanding New Zealand’s renewable energy capacity to support the country’s ambitious goal of achieving zero emissions. Our advanced binary technology will enable Contact Energy to operate with zero emissions, contributing to a sustainable future.”

The“putting a hole in the ground,”
We first reported on the work being done by the IADC Geothermal Committee in the first half of 2024. “We need to have some kind of standardized, international guidelines that we can point to that show – both to the industry and policymakers – that this is how we should drill these types of wells. We need to cut that red tape when it comes to rig specifications and equipment,”
The Geothermal Well Classification aims to accomplish the following:
* Establish a foundational framework for the IADC Geothermal Well Drilling Guidelines, providing clear context to distinguish well types and define the necessary equipment, standards, processes, and training for their safe and e;icient construction and operation.
* Act as a communication tool to bridge the gap between drilling and non-drilling professionals, using terminology familiar to the broader drilling industry to facilitate informed discussions.
* Present the complexities and unique challenges of geothermal well drilling in a clear and accessible manner, avoiding excessive technical detail while emphasizing project-specific drilling risks for comparison.
* Identify gaps in the supply chain that may hinder geothermal project development, enabling IADC members to address these challenges and develop geothermal-specific solutions.
This classification will also serve as the foundation for a complexity calculator, designed to provide a clear and accessible visual representation of the complexities and unique challenges associated with geothermal wells. The calculator is still in development and is expected to be released following the publication of this document.

!“Geothermal Power Generation – Developments and Innovation” 2nd edition now out Geothermal Power Generation - Developments and Innovations 2nd edition by DiPippo, Gutiérrez-Negrín, and Chiasson
![ ](

The 2nd edition of Geothermal Power Generation has been published, providing a valuable educational resource for both industry and academia.
![](
![](
![](
![](

![](
Elsevier has published the second edition of its comprehensive book
The original edition, published in 2016, was edited by Ronald DiPippo; the new one was edited by DiPippo along with Luis C.A. Gutiérrez-Negrín and Andrew Chiasson. The book comprises 28 chapters written by 40 authors from 12 countries, namely, Chile, Costa Rica, Germany, Iceland, Indonesia, Italy, Kenya, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, United Kingdom and United States. There is also an appendix with data on installed geothermal power plants across the world showing trends and projections for the near-term.
#### Representing eight years of progress
In the eight years following the first edition, geothermal power has continued to be a steady and reliable source of electricity to nearly 70 million people around the world. The number of countries served by geothermal power plants has risen from 24 in 2015 to 32, with another 11 poised to join the geothermal club of nations. In 2015, about 12 GW of geothermal power was installed, whereas now the total exceeds 16 GW, representing nearly 4% annual growth.
The book is organized into four sections:
Part One
Part Two
Part Three
Part Four
The first three sections follow the typical chronological order in the development of a resource, from the beginning of exploration through to the options for engineering a power plant, including environmental, economic, social and cultural considerations.
The chapters are descriptive while giving enough analytical material to allow readers to apply scientific principles to understand the design and performance of various plants. The last section includes eight chapters describing actual plants operating around the world, from the earliest ones in Italy, now over 120 years ago, to recent developments in Kenya, and several other countries and regions.
Throughout the book, color photographs and diagrams are used to convey the nature of geothermal resources and a physical sense of different power plant designs, including dry steam, single-, double-, and triple-flash, to a variety of binary and hybrid plants. Extensive reference lists and bibliographies accompany each chapter for further in-depth reading and research.
#### New chapters on innovations and emerging regions
The second edition includes several new chapters dealing with developments in the Philippines, Central America and the Caribbean, Chile, and Kenya. Another new chapter presents a case study of the large geothermal field at Cerro Prieto in Mexico that has been in continuous operation for over 50 years since 1973.
Innovations and emerging technologies include Advanced Deep Drilling (ADD) and Mineral Recovery (MR) from geothermal brines. While neither of these emerging technologies has been brought to the commercial stage, they promise results in the near term. So far, ADD has demonstrated that existing productive fields can be enhanced, but no power plant has been developed solely by using ADD techniques. Likewise, mineral recovery, in particular the recovery of lithium, has been demonstrated in laboratory tests using simulated brines, and pilot demonstration plants have been designed, however extending the concepts to full-scale operation at a real power plant, or as a stand-alone mineral recovery plant, has so far proven highly challenging.

#### A book for both geothermal and non-geothermal readers
The following is excerpted from a book review by Susan Fox Hodgson, California Div. of Oil, Gas and Geothermal, retired.
> Geothermal Power Generation: Developments and Innovation, Second Edition
> Some chapters touch on geothermal history. An example is Chapter 21, titled “Larderello, Italy: The Oldest Geothermal Field in Operation in the World.” The chapter begins with a Prologue, “…an historical outline, beginning in Prehistory, of Italian geothermal development up to 1960, with particular reference to the Boraciferous Region.” The Prologue, by Raffaele Cataldi, is followed by technical information from authors, Roberto Parri, Franco Lazzeri, and Alessandro Lenzi. The issues they discuss include “…studies and pilot tests on new materials and/or alloys for turbines and auxiliary equipment.”
> It doesn’t matter if you work in geothermal or don’t know the first thing about it. The book is for you. If you are unfamiliar with geothermal power plants, someday you may need a few geothermal facts. Say out of the blue, a developer suggests building a geothermal power plant in your area. You and other residents want to understand the project. Reading through the chapter titles can help guide you to the information you need. Geothermal developers will find the book useful, as well. Talking to (or teaching) community groups about geothermal energy and answering their questions is part of the job.
> The chapters are well-illustrated with helpful maps, photos, and figures. About 75 percent of the illustrations are in color, which I enjoyed.

A joint development risk protection mechanism for geothermal in Germany has been announced by KfW and Munich Re at the Praxisforum Geothermie Bayern event.

German federal development bank the Praxisforum Geothermie.Bayern event in Pullach.
Pullach’s mayor Susanna Tausendfreund, a pioneer of geothermal energy, welcomed the participants to the event. In 2002, the municipality of Pullach in the Isar Valley founded Innovative Energy for Pullach (IEP), and since 2005 households and businesses have benefited from the regional, climate-friendly, safe heat from the depths. The Pullach network has been steadily expanded since then, and further drilling is planned. A new feature is the sale of CO2 certificates. On today’s day of the congress, the proceeds went to Pullach’s partner municipality in Ukraine to help them survive the coming winter.
“Bavaria is a pioneer in geothermal energy. Today we both want to help to ensure that the topic is not only pushed in Bavaria, but nationwide,” “We hope that with the program we can help to implement projects that might not otherwise be possible.”
“A huge compliment to KfW for the short time in which such a program was able to be implemented here,”
#### Conditionally repayable loan for feasibility studies
A geothermal drilling costs many millions of euros. If no – or too little – hot deep water is found underground, the money is literally wasted. This is a risk that is difficult for municipalities and public utilities in particular to bear.
To held manage these risks, KfW is planning a geothermal energy development loan that will seamlessly follow on from BAFA funding for, among other things, feasibility studies prior to drilling. The mechanism combines financing with risk protection. The loan from the federal funding is conditionally repayable and provides for debt relief of up to 100 percent of the bank loan for the drilling if no or only partial discovery is made. It can be combined with the federal funding for efficient heating networks (BEW).
“This should also secure financing that might not otherwise be available through banks,”
The start is planned for January 2025, but is still subject to budgetary approval. Otherwise, everything is prepared. “We have spoken in detail with the four major banking associations and interested financing partners, whom we inform as standard before introducing programs,”
#### Insurance for geothermal drilling
“Lack of exploration is still the main risk in geothermal energy. Only 73% of wells find something on the first attempt. In 16% of cases, sufficient exploration can still be achieved after the well has been upgraded. 11% do not find anything,”“The better the data, the better a project can be insured.”
For their part, Munich Re is offering exploration insurance focusing on municipal heat supply and on industry with heat requirements. It corresponds to the drilling costs and also includes a dynamic adjustment to possible rising costs and stimulation measures, such as drilling a sidetrack or acidifying an initially dry well. The possible payout is defined based on the thermal output achieved.
In the event of partial exploration, there is a partial payout. The risk assessment and thus the premium are influenced by various factors, e.g. the geographical location, the data situation and the insured benefits or a possible deductible.
“The program in combination with KfW now makes it possible to insure projects that were previously uninsurable and will give the industry a huge boost,”
Project outlines can now be submitted to Munich Re for review, and as soon as the government gives the final go-ahead after the budget has been passed, financing can begin.
#### Extremely positive changes in framework conditions for geothermal
The Praxisforum Geothermie.Bayern event provided a platform to discuss the improvements in framework conditions in favor of geothermal in Germany. Organizer Dr. Jochen Schneider from “A lot has happened in the past year and numerous new projects are emerging. We are pleased that things are progressing like this.”
The federal government currently has a draft law to speed up approval procedures. The expansion of geothermal energy is therefore in the overriding public interest, and the Federal Mining Act is also due to be amended.
Alexander Rettenberger from the Southern Bavaria Mining Authority talked about the measures that the agency is taking to improve agreements with public interest groups and authorities. In this respect, the Mining Authority’s involvement in the agreements makes sense and should take place in the future. Rettenberger gave a number of tips on how applications can be made more complete and compact in order to speed up the processing of applications.
#### Financing for geothermal in smaller municipalities
Helmut Mangold from IEP was the last keynote speaker to address the economic viability of geothermal projects and the options available. He called for reliable political statements and reliable framework condition.
“Real renewable heat can only keep up with combined heat and power if the CO2 price reaches 150 euros,”“It would also help to give renewable heat priority access to heating networks, similar to renewable electricity. We also need reliable funding regimes; without reliability, you cannot tackle a project that has a time horizon of five to ten years.”
He also called for guarantees from the state, as the municipalities are overwhelmed by this. A future fund to finance heating projects, for example by municipal utilities, which are “too small” for many investors, would also make sense. As a new IEP project, Mangold presented the “Pullach Renewable Energy Heat Index (PEEWI)”, to which district heating companies with a share of at least 60% renewable energy can contribute their data.

The booklet was launched in a special “OECS sustainable energy celebration” at the climax of the 3rd Nationally Determined Contributions Investment Forum and Marketplace, held at the Radisson Grenada Beach Resort from March 31 to April 2. It was formally presented to Hon. Konris Maynard of St Kitts and Nevis, the current chair of the OECS Council of Ministers: Energy by Dr. Ernie Stapleton, OECS GEOBUILD’s Project Manager.
This comprehensive, 48-page publication, developed under the OECS Geothermal Energy: Capacity Building for Utilisation, Investment and Local Development (Dominica’s advanced 10-MW power plant development scheduled for completion in December 2025 to emerging projects in four other Member States: Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and St Vincent and the Grenadines.
The booklet also addresses key aspects of geothermal development, including environmental benefits, economic advantages, and various technological approaches to geothermal power generation.
“This publication marks a significant milestone in our region’s journey toward energy security and sustainability as we place on record the journey towards geothermal energy development from the Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) context,”
“Whilst many islands have good potential for geothermal energy, the unique nature of geothermal and the circumstances of SIDS makes the development of geothermal though a worthwhile undertaking, one which needs strong commitment, strategy and partnerships. It is therefore important to understand the steps taken so far to build on the knowledge base for geothermal ? development on islands.”

Preparatory work is set to begin at a plot of land in the Lahe district in the city of Hanover, Germany, for a geothermal project to be developed by
The drill site is then to be prepared by autumn 2025 for planned drilling by mid-2026. Construction work on the heating plant will be then in parallel with drilling. If all goes according to plan, the system will be delivering green and sustainable heating by spring of 2027.
The framework for this geothermal project was established with the signing of a heat supply contract between Eavor and heat regional utility
As part of a leasehold agreement, Eavor has been provided by the city with a plot of land on the corner of Kirchhorster Straße and Alte Peiner Heerstraße in the Lahe district.
“We are pleased to be taking another step towards the heat transition and to be able to establish a geothermal project here in Hanover that sets standards. The project makes an important and innovative contribution to climate protection,”
“With CO2-free geothermal energy, we can cover around 15 percent of Hanover’s district heating needs. This alone corresponds to the annual needs of up to 20,000 apartments,”
“We think it’s good that we are starting the joint project now. With our innovative technology, we will show what contribution we can make to the heat transition,”
More details on the project will be presented publicly at the meeting of the Bothfeld-Vahrenheide district council on the 23rd of October.

The Government of New Zealand will be allocating up to $60 million from the Regional Infrastructure Fund to explore the potential of supercritical geothermal technology (SCGT).
“Geothermal energy is sourced from extremely hot rock heated by magma. At present, conventional geothermal wells are drilled to a maximum depth of about 3.5 km. However, scientists believe that by drilling beyond this, possibly to 6km deep, more energy will be available,”Regional Development Minister Shane Jones.
“The energy generated from supercritical geothermal technology (SCGT) could be up to three times greater than current geothermal energy from steam. In the long term this could be a game-changer for New Zealand and potentially internationally, with other countries also chasing solutions to energy challenges.”
#### Supercritical geothermal potential in the TVZ
Initially only $5 million of the funding will be drawn down for work on the detailed design and cost to drill the first of three exploratory deep wells in the Taupo Volcanic Zone. The Crown will also engage with stakeholders, particularly local iwi and hapu, on opportunities for involvement.
The initiative will be led by GNS Science and the Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment (MBIE). The work will be informed by GNS Science’s “Geothermal: The Next Generation” research which was funded by MBIE’s Endeavour Research Fund and years of other studies at the Taupo Volcanic Zone.
“The science has confirmed that supercritical geothermal resources are available and abundant in the Taupo Volcanic Zone,”
“This investment and support from the Government is critical to derisking and developing the technologies that will harness this huge potential. It continues to position New Zealand and the energy industry as a world leader in geothermal technology development.”

The drilling of a geothermal doublet has been completed in Neuruppin, Germany, which will supply sustainable heat to the district heating network by 2027.
![](
![](
![](
Drilling of a geothermal doublet in the town of Neuruppin in Brandenburg, Germany has been officially completed. With this, geothermal is expected to start contributing to district heating in Neuruppin by 2027.
Drilling of the doublet started in June of this year. The project has been led by local utility
Initial tests of the first well have yielded very positive results. “Instead of 200 cubic meters per hour, we could even extract 330 cubic meters,”
#### Choosing tried and tested technology
The next phase of the project will involve the acquisition and installation of six large heat pumps. The heat pumps have not been ordered as permission is still needed from the mining authority. However, SWN already has their eyes on the type of heat pump they prefer and a specific manufacturer.
“We deliberately opted for tried and tested technology rather than the latest technology,”
#### Lower heating prices by 2027
SWN had already been given a federal grant of EUR 10 million for the project, as announced back in early 2023. This funding will go towards acquiring the technology for the project. However, SWN also intends to apply for another EUR 20 million grant that will subsidize the operation of the plant, thus reducing the price that customers will have to pay.
With the subsidy, residents of Neuruppin can hope for heating rates that are about 2 cents per kWh cheaper. Rates are not likely to go below the rates before the conflict in Ukraine, but they can be significantly cheaper than the current rates.

Dandelion Energy, a leader in residential geothermal systems, has developed a streamlined installation process that makes it easier and more affordable than ever for builders and homeowners to benefit from geothermal heat pumps. By eliminating the need for outdoor AC units and traditional heating systems, Dandelion’s technology enhances home efficiency and durability. Homeowners in participating communities will enjoy the peace of mind that comes with a low-maintenance, resilient, and emissions-free heating and cooling solution.
“This partnership with Lennar sets a new benchmark for affordable, energy efficient, and high-quality home heating and cooling,”Daniel Yates“We’re excited to bring our geothermal technology into a high-production environment and accelerate our efforts to deliver the unparalleled comfort, performance, and cost savings of geothermal heat pumps to Colorado
“Our collaboration with Dandelion Energy brings innovative geothermal technology into our homes—offering ColoradoStuart Miller“It supports our broader commitment to making high-quality, attainable housing more accessible.”
Geothermal heat pumps dramatically lower home energy use and costs. Due to their superior efficiency, geothermal heat pumps also significantly reduce peak electric demand. According to a recent report from the Department of Energy, widespread adoption of geothermal heat pumps could eliminate the need for 24,500 miles of new grid transmission lines — the equivalent of crossing the United States
“Geothermal energy – the heat beneath our feet – is a clean energy option that will help save Coloradans money and protect our state for future generations. I’m very excited that Dandelion is building on Colorado’s by connecting more than 1,500 Colorado
“Geothermal heat pumps are extremely efficient at both heating and cooling, while reducing emissions, easing demand on the electric grid, and saving residents thousands of dollars on energy costs,”Will Toor “Ensuring affordable access to geothermal heating and cooling is essential to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and we’re excited to be part of such a huge effort to bring this technology to so many new Colorado
This initiative will benefit from incentives including Colorado’sColorado
“This ground-source heat pump project is an example of how our Clean Heat Plan and our electrification strategy for new home developments are delivering on our shared climate goals and keeping bills low,”Robert Kenney
“Our customer options, including rebates, are designed to lower the cost of highly efficient electric technologies for customers interested in all-electric new homes, as well as replacing their natural gas furnaces to reduce the use of natural gas in existing homes. We’ll continue working with the Governor’s office, the state, local governments and industry partners to raise awareness for the new programs and rebates available to our customers to lower their own emissions and keep their energy bills low.”

The project is described as a low-temperature power generation project, drawing thermal water from a 3000-meter deep well with a wellhead temperature of about 102 °C. This is typical in the medium-low enthalpy sedimentary basin-type geothermal field of the Guanzhong region.
During the heating season, geothermal is utilized for low-load power generation, which cascades down to heating by heat exchange. When heating is not needed, the project generates electricity at full load. The combined heat and power plant is described to have a heating capacity of 170,000 square meters and an annual power generation capacity of about 700,000 kWh.
The facility also serves as a demonstration project for helium extraction. Analysis of the thermal waters in this region indicated that the helium content of most geothermal wells was exceptionally high compared to both local and international averages.
In recent years, Sinopec has continued to carry out water-soluble helium separation and purification experiments and key technology research in Xianyang City, and has successfully applied it to this project. Through membrane separation and pressure swing adsorption coupling process, helium with a purity of more than 99% has been obtained, providing valuable technical experience for the further industrialization of geothermal water-soluble helium.
Sinopec continues to deepen its geothermal field and has become the largest geothermal energy development and utilization company in China. Although China is currently the world leader in geothermal heating capacity, its geothermal power generation sector is still at the development stage. As of the end of 2022, the geothermal power generation of China is at 53.45 MW.

Construction has officially begun on a landmark large-scale mine water heat project in the town of Seaham in County Durham, England. The Seaham Energy Centre will soon provide heat for a new housing development, the Seaham Garden Village.
The Energy Centre is being built next to the
The mine water heating will provide power to 750 of the homes on the Seaham Garden Village development, delivered by northern housing association Karbon Homes, in partnership with Esh Group.
The district heat network project has been led by Durham County Council, with the Mining Remediation Authority spearheading the development of the mine water heating initiative. he project has benefited from a grant from the Government’s Heat Networks Investment Project which has enabled the project to be delivered.
“This scheme is a further milestone in our journey to harness mine water heat to provide sustainable heating solutions across the former coalfields,
“There is huge potential to utilise our GB-wide water treatment facilities where warm mine water is already being pumped to the surface, and we’re progressing opportunities in multiple regions. The mine water heat scheme at Dawdon paves the way demonstrating a further route for mine water to provide low-carbon heat, building on the success of schemes in Gateshead and at Lanchester Wines.”
![]( showing how the Seaham Garden Village mine water heat scheme will work (source: Mining Remediation Authority)
The Dawdon scheme began treating mine water in 2009 and the Mining Remediation Authority has been researching the possibility of ‘bolting on’ the heat feature to these treatment sites as part of their pioneering work in the geothermal arena.
This new development follows the success of the Gateshead scheme, the UK’s first large-scale mine water heat network, which began providing heat to homes and businesses in March 2023, as well as another pioneering privately funded scheme nearby at Lanchester Wines warehouses.
Unlike Seaham Garden Village, the Gateshead projects used boreholes, which were drilled up to 150 metres underground to tap into water in disused mines.
“We are delighted to have started work on what will be the UK’s first large-scale mine water heat project that uses a mine water treatment scheme, right here in County Durham,”“This innovative project will have significant environmental benefits – making use of currently untapped heat to keep houses warm, and potentially a school and innovation hubs, and in doing so avoiding the need to use non-renewable sources of energy.”

The Geothermal Atlas of Alberta
The tool is designed to support the exploration and development of geothermal resources in Alberta by providing key information and capabilities including the following:
* Relevant geoscience data for exploring geothermal energy below the base of groundwater protection.
* Key insights into formation’s temperature, pore volume, and fluid presence.
* A technical information website detailing methodologies and techniques.
* The ability to query depth, thickness, and temperature at specific locations.
* Geological and geothermal statistics at the legal subdivision (LSD) scale.
* Identification of geologically favorable areas for potential conventional geothermal development.

The Geothermal Atlas also shows the regional geothermal energy potential of specific geological units in Alberta. The geothermal potential was estimated using a deterministic (well-based) resource quantification approach developed at the Alberta Geological Survey (AGS) by adapting the widely accepted and standardized USGS volumetric method to the one-dimensional (i.e., well) scale. Additionally, the geothermal potential was estimated using the USGS volumetric method with probability distributions, factoring in reservoir characteristics such as temperature, volume, porosity, specific heat capacity, and density.
There has been plenty of geothermal development activity in Alberta in recent years, mostly centering on geothermal greenhouse projects in Hinton and Rainbow Lake. Less than a month ago, the Government of Alberta announced an investment into the Alberta Drilling Accelerator, a test facility that will allow for the development of advanced drilling technologies that will serve the energy industry, including geothermal.

Drilling of the Banska PGP-4 well in Szaflary, Poland has ended at 6103 meters depth, short of the 7000-meter target, due to several drilling challenges.

The drilling of a geothermal borehole in the town of Szalfary in the Malopolska Province in Poland, has been officially ended at a depth of exactly 6103.2 meters. Though short of the target 7-kilometer depth, it was nevertheless an impressive effort to set a new record for the deepest geothermal borehole for heating. For now, that record is still held by the 6.4-kilometer well in Otaniemi, Finland.
Drilling work for the Banska PGP-4 well started in April 2023. By the end of that year, it was reported that the well had already reached the 5000-meter mark. By then, it had also intersected a large reservoir with temperature of 120 °C.
Work had to be stopped at a depth of around 5900 meters because the drill had reached a very hard rock formation, resulting in a very slow rate of penetration. The walls of the well had also started collapsing, which had to be repaired. More so, the top drive failed and the main cable broke at a depth of 6096 meters. Drilling was resumed in July 2024.
With these challenges in consideration, it was decided that drilling will be terminated before the target depth had been reached. According to the initial assessment, the 120 °C resource had the greatest potential to be used for geothermal heating for the Szaflary commune and nearby areas, including the city of Nowy Targ. The well had also fulfilled its purpose as a research tool, providing subsurface information at previously unknown depths.
Tests will still have to be done to determine the temperature, productivity, and the physicochemical properties of the waters from the well. This information will be the basis for creating a model for the use of thermal waters in the entire Podhale region.
Preparatory work for the construction of a 5.5-kilometer heating main is already ongoing. The plan is for the geothermal heat to be distributed from the heating plant in Banska Nizna. The commune is also applying for funding for the implementation of the second stage of the project, which will involve building the connection of the geothermal network to the individual users.
Geothermal research and drilling in Szaflary will contribute greatly to the building momentum for geothermal heating in Poland. The country will soon have 11 geothermal heating plants operational, the latest ones being in Turek and Konin.

# Small-scale geothermal power plants in Japan pave way for bigger plants

With a host of benefits to the local community and economy, the Tsuchiyi Onsen-geothermal power plant in Japan serves as a model for larger-scale projects.
![](

Tsuchiyu Onsen, a hot spring resort sixteen kilometers from Fukushima in Japan, is home to a geothermal power plant that successfully generates 400 kW of electricity, which is
The plant serves as a prime example of how local communities across Japan and the wider world can benefit from small-scale plants, which can potentially lead to the development of larger plants in the future. A report published by JOGMEC in 2023 shows that most geothermal power plants in Japan are considered small, with capacities ranging from 20 to 250 kW, largely brought about by favorable FiT rates.
#### Community effort
Primarily, the plant provides the community with a reliable clean energy source available 24/7, regardless of weather. Fortunately, even those without access to geothermal can still take steps to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions with existing conventional energy systems. For example, energy-efficient HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) systems can heat and cool homes with minimal energy loss.
Americans, in particular,
Local business owners in Tsuchiyu Onsen founded energy company, Genki Up Tsuchiyu, in order to fund and build the geothermal plant themselves. “The community bonded together to shift from nuclear energy to a source of energy that seemed safer,
It is estimated that Japan’s ample geothermal resources can potentially generate 10% of the country’s power, whereas nuclear power (which poses meltdown and radiation risks) currently accounts for 5.8% of energy production. Katsuichi Kato, President of Genki Up Tsuchiyu, said the key to the plant’s success is that it was never considered merely a “profit-making” tool, but rather a boon for the whole town. This sparked community spirit and everyone remained committed to the development of a sustainable town and energy plant that benefits all.

A boost to tourism and other industries
On top of clean energy efficiency, the plant is also a draw for tourists, who boost the local economy. This is particularly important for Tsuchiyu Onsen, which is only forty kilometers from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, as the nuclear disaster in 2011 had long driven tourists away from the area.
Thousands of people from across the country now visit to learn about how the geothermal power plant works. This generates further revenue for local businesses. The plant’s warm waste water is even funneled off for local aquaculture projects, which farm giant river prawn. Local hotels and restaurants then serve these prawns, while tourists also fish them.
No intrusion upon natural environment
The plant at Tsuchiyu Onsen is built on top of an existing spring water well, so there was no need to drill any new wells. “This can help convince local communities throughout Japan that they can build similar projects without damaging their natural and beautiful environments,”
Indeed, as one of the world’s most volcanically active countries, Japan is ripe for geothermal energy production. It’s estimated the country can potentially generate around 23 gigawatts of geothermal power. As such, the Japanese government
Small plants like the one at Tsuchiyu Onsen “are unlikely to change the face of Japanese energy production on their own”“But they can play an important role in getting people to understand and accept geothermal power — and pave the way for bigger plants in the future”.

“It’s exciting to see the culmination of the drilling last year with positive recommendations for the development of the shallow geothermal energy system on campus,”
#### Designing a geothermal heating system
With the first phase of the project completed, the university will now progress to the design of geothermal heating systems in the campus. Plans are in development for a new geothermal campus energy centre, which will form the backbone for a low-carbon heat supply to the engineering cluster.
“As we move onto the next stages, which will design and build that new energy system, I can now look forward to working in a building heated with low-carbon renewable energy from beneath the campus,” further added Loveridge.
Insights from the project will also help the progress of other geothermal research projects in Leeds. This includes the newly announced GeoGrid project which explores how geothermal can be used for grid balancing, thus helping to integrate renewable energy sources in the UK’s energy systems.

The first of eight planned exploratory wells will be drilled in the town of Durdevac in the Koprivnica-Krizevci County, Croatia. This is according to a statement by Hrvoje Janci, Mayor of Durdevac. The plan is for the work to start soon, although no concrete timeline was mentioned.
An investment of EUR 80 million will go towards the geothermal research project which aims to confirm the data on geothermal potential in the region from studies done 30 years ago. The project will be headed by oil and gas company exploration of the Lescan license.
Located about 500 meters north of Durdevac, the Lescan field has been described to have one of the biggest geothermal potentials in Europe. Janci further explained that INA will start investing on the construction of a geothermal power plant should the large potential be confirmed.
Aside from generating electricity, part of the objectives of the project is to supply heat to agricultural and industrial facilities. The Mayor stated that providing cheap energy to industrial processes can revitalize the local economy and lead to the creation of new jobs.

The Memorandum of Understanding between the two universities was signed in Taoyuan City in Taiwan with Professor Andreas Busch, Professor of Earth Sciences at Heriot-Watt, and Professor Shu-Kun Hsu, Dean of the College of Earth Sciences at NCU.
Beyond research, the MoU includes a commitment to share equipment and facilities, co-supervise PhD students, joint industry projects, enhancing innovation activities and enriching the learning experience for students and early career researchers. The MoU, effective immediately, commits both institutions to collaborate over the next few years. Joint initiatives will include workshops, student placements, co-developed teaching programmes, joint funding applications, and shared access to world-class facilities.
“This partnership is a significant milestone in our mission to drive sustainable solutions to global energy challenges,”
“NCU is strong on education and research in the field of Earth Sciences and recently have put much efforts on energy transition, renewable energy (especially on offshore wind, geothermal, ocean energy), carbon capture and storage and geological disposal of high-level nuclear waste. These fields of study match very well with Heriot-Watt’s GeoEnergy initiatives. The collaboration between two universities will definitely bring profound impacts on both societies,”
Dr Uisdean Nicholson, Associate Professor of Geoscience, who initiated this collaboration, further said: “By combining Heriot-Watt’s research excellence with those of National Central University, we aim to unlock new opportunities and work to find innovative solutions to renewable energy from geothermal sources and to decarbonise industry through CCS. Together, we will deliver meaningful impact through cutting-edge research and knowledge-sharing that benefits both students and society.”
The NCU had previously entered into a partnership with CPC Taiwan and Academia Sinica to cooperate on geothermal research, development, and exploration. This is only one of many partnerships formalized in the past year as a response to the Taiwanese government’s energy transformation policy and the call to promote the research and development of green energy and carbon reduction technologies.

The fourth episode of GeoTV
With over 1,200 global leaders in attendance at the event, this episode dives into the growing momentum of geothermal energy and its role in tackling the climate crisis.
#### Geothermal for Indigenous communities
A unique part of this year’s Geothermal Rising Conference was the Indigenous Geothermal Symposium where members of the Indigenous communities came together to explore the cultural, technological, and environmental aspects of geothermal energy. It was a platform for Indigenous voices to be heard, highlighting their important role in the development of geothermal resources in many territories worldwide.
It was also an opportunity for different Indigenous communities to come together and share their knowledge and experience on many aspects of geothermal development.
“It brought together Indigenous community members from around the globe to talk about geothermal, to talk about how their communities work with their governments to develop geothermal, and how it benefits Indigenous communities,”
“They shared that knowledge with other communities that want to learn more about geothermal to see how they can develop it on their lands.”

#### Innovative technologies
The segment of ThinkGeoEnergy featured an innovative flowmeter technology developed by Indonesia’s PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGEO). The flowmeter, called Flow2Max, allowed for real-time measurement of two-phase flow and enthalpy, allowing for closer monitoring of wells and an overall improvement in reservoir management practice.
![]( with PT PGE’s Mohamad Husni Mubarok – Screenshot from GeoTV Episode 4
PGEO officially launched the Flow2Max earlier this year, having successfully applied for patents for the technology in several territories, including the US, the Philippines, and New Zealand.
#### The Declaration of Communication
Gabriella Skog of Baseload Capital then showcases the launch of the Geothermal Declaration of Communication at the Geothermal Rising Conference. This is a whitepaper, endorsed by key industry stakeholders, that calls for a unified messaging for the global geothermal industry to improve public perception and external communication.

The GEMINI project aims to deploy two shallow (<500 m depth) geothermal energy systems in the Sligo Regional Sports Centre and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive Centre of Excellence, Belfast and Northern Ireland Water, Belfast. There will also be a deep geothermal pilot demonstrator in the TUDublin campus in Grangegorman, where a 2 km deep borehole will be drilled.
Additional data will also be collected for potential future sites, thereby ensuring that the GEMINI work will have wider impacts for the island by increasing and improving knowledge of the sub-surface and Ireland’s potential geothermal resources.
This information will also help to inform new policies, guidelines and supports for the sector through geological heat potential maps, crossborder policy recommendations, toolkits for decision makers (homeowners, planners, developers and local government), community engagement guidelines, and business and skills development activities.
“Geothermal Energy is a readily accessible, always-on 24/7 source of renewable energy to decarbonise the heating & cooling sector. As part of the cross-border GEMINI project, Queen’s interdisciplinary research is supporting the development of a number of demonstrator sites across the island of Ireland to help build momentum for the uptake of geothermal energy across the island,”
“Important partnership work has made this project possible, and I commend the partners involved for their ongoing collaboration with the public sector in the north. The public sector is our largest energy consumer, and I welcome GEMINI’s commitment to reduce its carbon emissions by unlocking our island’s deep geothermal potential and supporting our move away from imported fossil fuels,”

joined forces to develop non-conventional renewable energy in Colombia through geothermal energy. This project, recently highlighted in an article in La Patria, is coordinated by Julián López Palacio and is intended to be carried out in the Nereidas Valley, near the Nevado del Ruiz volcano. The objective is to take advantage of underground heat to generate electricity, adding energy to the country’s current grid.
The Nereidas Valley, the epicentre of this project, has been a hotbed of geothermal exploration since 1997, when the Nereidas 1 well was drilled. Now, with a new phase of exploration, the region is expected to have a potential of up to 65 MW. If the new drilling is successful, a 30-MW plant capable of supplying a city like Manizales would be built.

![ ](
![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 21 Feb 2025
Geothermal Investment Forum Croatia, the first major geothermal event to be hosted in Croatia, will be taking place on 3-4 March 2025 in Zagreb.
![](
![](
![](
In early March, Zagreb will host the first-ever
The conference will take place on 3-4 March 2025
Registration for GIFC 2025 is now open.
Amidst ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, strengthening Europe’s energy, sovereignty and sustainability has become a key priority. Geothermal energy is a renewable, stable, and carbon-neutral energy source, with estimates suggesting it could meet up to a quarter of Europe’s heating and cooling needs and up to 10% of its electricity demand. Recognized as a key driver in achieving climate neutrality by 2050 under the European Green Deal, geothermal energy is gaining increasing prominence.
The European Parliament’s 2023 EU Policy Document on Geothermal Energy acknowledges its critical role in decarbonizing the heating and cooling sector. Additionally, in late 2023, a Report on Geothermal Energy was adopted to shape future legislative initiatives of the European Commission and provide member states with a policy framework for geothermal energy development. The urgency of geothermal energy development was reaffirmed in December 2024 by the Council of Ministers, which called on the European Commission to draft a comprehensive strategy for heating and cooling decarbonization, supported by the EU geothermal action plan, to facilitate project implementation and accelerate geothermal energy deployment.
#### The high geothermal potential of Croatia
Croatia boasts the highest geothermal potential in Europe, exceeding the European average by 60%, presenting both a challenge and a responsibility to harness this resource for clean and stable energy for its citizens. According to Croatia’s National Energy and Climate Plan, the anticipated electricity output from geothermal sources by 2030 is expected to reach 68 MW—equivalent to one-fifth of the capacity of the Croatian share in the Krško Nuclear Power Plant’s (348 MW), which currently meets 16% of Croatia’s annual electricity demand.
However, with further investments, projections for 2050 are estimated at 405 MW, surpassing Croatia’s share of Krško, meaning that over 30% of the country’s electricity could come solely from geothermal and nuclear sources—not even accounting for additional contributions from solar, wind, and hydropower, which are also carbon-neutral.
“Croatia holds a unique position in Europe. Our high geothermal gradient, combined with strategic investments, can position us as a geothermal leader at the European level, while providing our citizens with clean and stable energy. Geothermal energy is becoming an increasingly vital part of the energy mix—Europe has recognized this, while Croatia, as a country with one of the greatest potentials, must act swiftly”,
He further emphasized that the development of geothermal projects requires significant financial investments, which is why the conference will host representatives from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the World Bank, and the European Investment Bank (EIB).

#### The time for Croatia to position itself strategically
Panels and discussions at the conference will cover various topics, including geothermal energy in urban development in the context of enhancing energy efficiency, with concrete examples of cities that have implemented geothermal heating and cooling systems. The focus will also be on the investment models and risk mitigation, concentrating on successful investment case studies and the use of geothermal energy in agriculture. The panelists will include representatives from leading energy companies such as ENNA, SOYAK, and SLB, as well as Members of the European Parliament, led by Croatian MEP Davor Ivo Stier.
“We are not reinventing the wheel—we are literally sitting on it – Croatia one of Europe’s leading geothermal potentials, yet awareness remains low, despite a clear need at both the European and national level. This forum is the first to actively promote Croatia’s geothermal potential. Now is the time for Croatia to strategically position itself and attract investment for the green energy transition,”
The GIFC 2025 expert program committee includes representatives from: Hrvoje Požar (Energy Institute), Croatian Chamber of Economy (CCE), European Geothermal Energy Council (EGEC), Croatian Geothermal Energy Association, Faculty of Mining, Geology, and Petroleum Engineering, led by Dragutin Domitrovic, energy expert and Director of IGeoPen.
“This conference is a clear signal that Croatia is being recognized as a key hub for geothermal energy development in Europe. Geothermal energy is a driver of economic growth and a resource that can provide stable and predictable energy today. In order to reach its full potential, it must be consistently integrated into strategic plans and implementation policies. Clear and supportive conditions for all renewable energy sources are essential, and in the case of geothermal energy, this is particularly crucial due to the complexity of such projects,”
GIFC 2025 is the project developed by Alpheus Public Affairs, co-organized by the Croatian Chamber of Economy (HGK) and in partnership with the European Geothermal Energy Council (EGEC). The conference is held under the high patronage of the Ministry of Economy of the Republic of Croatia and the European Parliament (EP). Institutional support is provided by the Croatian Hydrocarbon Agency (CHA), which has developed a unique, interactive, and publicly accessible platform mapping all geothermal exploration and exploitation sites in Croatia.
The CHA has also secured €30 million in grants from the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) for geothermal exploration near six Croatian cities: Vinkovci, Vukovar, Osijek, Sisak, Zaprešic, and Velika Gorica. If these prove to be successful, they could provide geothermal heating sources for households, public institutions, and businesses in these cities.

In late 2023, the US DOE published a study on the potential impact on decarbonization efforts of national mass-scale deployment of geothermal heat pumps. Based on the results of the study, retrofitting around 70% of U.S. buildings with GHPs could reduce electricity demand by as much as 13% by 2050 versus decarbonizing without GHPs.

During the meeting of the Global Geothermal Alliance during the recent General Assembly meeting of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Dr. Hatibu Kazungu, Tanzania’s Energy deputy permanent secretary, outlined the geothermal potential of his country. The geothermal resources of the country are found in two branches of the East African Rift Valley, a known geothermal hot zone. Surveys conducted have identified around 50 promising sites across 16 regions in Tanzania.
Dr. Kazungu called for private sector investment and support from development partners, highlighting the ongoing efforts of the Tanzania Geothermal Development Company (TGDC), a subsidiary of TANESCO, in advancing five strategic projects:
* Ngozi (70 MW)
* Kiejo-Mbaka (60 MW)
* Songwe (38 MW)
* Luhoi (5 MW)
* Natron (60 MW)
These projects are at various stages of resource verification and detailed study, with the aim of harnessing geothermal energy to drive economic growth, protect the environment, and create jobs, as we have been reporting on before.
Experts have identified a large geothermal resource development potential for Tanzia, while though not as large as the potential of its neighbour Kenya.

The geothermal heating and cooling system at the Australian War Memorial has officially been switched on, supplying energy to the building from 216 vertical closed-loop boreholes drilled to depths of up to 150 meters. The project is described as the largest geothermal heat exchange system in Australia and was designed by Sydney-based
A ceremony was held to commemorate the start of operations of the geothermal system with Australian ministers Matt Keogh and Chris Bowen switching it on. The system is expected to reduce emission by 1400 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year and save the Memorial up to $1 million each year in energy costs compared to the previous system.
The project was first announced back in 2022. It was undertaken as part of a larger Australian War Memorial Development project, alongside efforts to expand the premises and redesign certain elements of the Memorial.
“The Australian War Memorial is an iconic national institution, commemorating those who secured our future. So it’s fitting that this institution now leads the way in securing our energy future,”“In a place that commemorates the past, this project firmly places the Australian War Memorial as a world-class building of the future.”

The plan is for Aalborg Forsyning to receive the extracted heat, whilst Green Therma invests, establishes, and drives the plant. The demonstration plant has an estimated capacity of around 2 MW. This is only a small part of Aalborg Forsyning’s energy needs, but the project’s purpose will be primarily to test the solution and explore whether the new technology can be part of Denmark’s future district heating.
To complete the project, Green Therma collaborates with some of the world’s leading companies within drilling, well completion, and installation of surface facilities. These partners – alongside Green Therma’s technology and Aalborg Forsyning’s wish to implement green solutions for district heating – provide optimal conditions for a successful outcome. Funding for the project is expected to come from a combination of public support and investment from Green Therma.
Søren Gais Kjeldsen, managing director of Aalborg Forsyning, says: “Aalborg Forsyning is working hard on the green transition of our district heating production, and we want to also actively take responsibility for society’s green transition by contributing to the testing, development, and implementation of green technologies. The collaboration with Green Therma comes naturally because we get to test and demonstrate their geothermal plant which represents a more environmentally friendly employment of the earth’s heat.”
Jørgen Peter Rasmussen, CEO of Green Therma, adds: “We are happy to perform Heat4Ever together with Aalborg Forsyning as part of their goal to find green solutions to use for the production of district heating. Our solution is very promising, and it represents a major opportunity for district heating companies and others – nationally and globally – who aim to have renewable energy production from the core of the earth without CO2 emissions.”

!Project Innerspace publishes Future of Geothermal in Pennsylvania report ""The Future of Geothermal in Pennsylvania"" by Project InnerSpace
![ ](
![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 26 Feb 2025
Project InnerSpace has published ""The Future of Geothermal in Pennsylvania,"" highlighting the Commonwealth's geothermal potential and pathway to development.

“The Future of Geothermal in Pennsylvania”
The report follows up on a landmark “Future of Geothermal in Texas” that Project InnerSpace published back in 2023.
#### A long history of energy innovation and development
Because of the robust oil and gas industry in Pennsylvania, subsurface temperatures in the Commonwealth have been recorded and modeled for years . This data shows that there is 1000-fold (or more) energy available in the form of heat underground than Pennsylvanians consume each year . There are also plenty of opportunities to use it, in some form, all across the Commonwealth’s 46,000-plus square miles.
If the Commonwealth were to drill geothermal wells at the same rate that it is now drilling for oil and gas wells, it could generate enough geothermal energy to meet all thermal demands for its commercial heating and low-temperature industrial processes. Geothermal could also help some of the region’s largest energy users—the industrial and agriculture sectors—reduce emissions while maintaining large numbers of jobs in the drilling sector .
Working with new and emerging technologies, geothermal could generate enough energy to meet 100 percent of Pennsylvania’s electricity, and heating, and low- to medium-temperature industrial process needs in as few as 10 years .
“Pennsylvania has a long and proud history of energy innovation, and my administration is working to cement the Commonwealth’s place as a national energy leader – working with the energy industry, including organizations like Project Innerspace, to build exciting new technology in Pennsylvania like geothermal, hydrogen, and more,”
“My ‘Lightning Plan’ will spark new innovation and build a more reliable, affordable energy grid by incentivizing new projects, streamlining permitting approvals, and encouraging communities to lower utility bills and improve reliability through shared energy resources. By coming together around commonsense technologies like geothermal, we can support groundbreaking projects, lower costs for consumers, create more jobs, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come.”
“Pennsylvania is an energy leader and an epicenter of oil and gas industry workforce, talent and know-how,”“Pennsylvania led the charge historically with the first oil well and in the shale revolution, now it can be at the forefront of the next drilling revolution, but this time around for heat.”
#### Policies to further push geothermal adoption
The Report offers 23 targeted policy recommendations to accelerate the adoption of geothermal energy across Pennsylvania, which could create economic savings for residents, generate long-term job opportunities, reduce emissions, and bolster energy security in the commonwealth.
The policy recommendations focus on six areas:
1. Provide industry with regulatory certainty and eliminate red tape;
2. Encourage the adoption of ground source heat pumps for building heating and cooling;
3. Create and expand targeted incentives for direct-use geothermal applications for the industrial and agricultural sectors;
4. Catalyze the creation of thermal energy networks to serve residential, commercial, academic, and public building;
5. Advance comprehensive state and regional power market policies that promote clean, firm, flexible power;
6. Educate stakeholders and create geothermal development strategies.
![]( recommendations from the Future of Geothermal in Pennsylvania report (source: Project InnerSpace)
“Geothermal energy is a potentially limitless, always-on power source that could provide clean, locally-sourced electricity to millions of Pennsylvania residents and businesses,” “A thriving, growing, job-creating economy isn’t built on yesterday’s technologies. It’s built on innovation – on bold investments. Project InnerSpace’s report shows that Pennsylvania can lead the way in this next energy revolution.”
“Pennsylvania can help the United States dominate on energy by ensuring we have a reliable, secure and diverse supply of energy,”“Given geothermal’s potential to help advance key industries in Pennsylvania like advanced manufacturing and agriculture, I am excited to see this resource be added to Pennsylvania’s prolific energy portfolio.”
“Pennsylvania is a national leader in energy production, and geothermal systems can be the next step in the Commonwealth’s transition to a cleaner, more resilient grid,”“As electricity demands continue to grow, geothermal can play a crucial role in creating clean energy jobs and lowering utility bills.”

Preparation work is being done at the drilling site for a research well to evaluate geothermal resources in Krefeld, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
A small area is being closed off in the city of Krefeld in Germany in preparation for drilling of a geothermal research well by the
The research drilling is part of the state-wide exploration and drilling program “Geothermal energy – We are exploring NRW / Geowärme Wir erkunden NRW”NRW Geothermal Energy Master Plan. “On behalf of the state, we are exploring the subsurface throughout North Rhine-Westphalia using various technologies in order to create the basis for using the climate-friendly heat from the interior of our earth,”
#### Investigating the limestone layer
Valuable findings are provided by drill cores, which are then examined in the GD NRW. In addition, extensive geophysical measurements are carried out in the borehole. A pumping test is intended to provide information on water permeability. The drilling data is representative of the region, will be presented to the public and will then be freely accessible. The drilling in Krefeld is a pure research drilling to explore the limestone in the subsurface.
The drilling is intended to penetrate the limestone of the so-called carbonate limestone completely. The experts suspect that the geological formation at the drilling point is between 400 and 700 meters deep.
“Even if the carbonate limestone is deeper than expected, with a drilling depth of 1,000 meters we have enough leeway to drill through its entire thickness,”
“As soon as we have drilled through the limestone layer and come across the sandstone underneath, we will stop drilling.”
#### Minimizing community impact
The preparation of the drilling site, the drilling work, the subsequent investigations in the borehole, its professional backfilling and the dismantling of the drilling rig will take a total of around five months. During this period, the rear parking lot of the town hall on Konrad-Adenauer-Platz/Girmesgath will be partially closed. Once the work is completed, the parking lot will be returned to its original state and will therefore be fully usable again.
“We planned the drilling so that residents are affected as little as possible and there are still enough parking spaces available,”
Groundwater protection is also guaranteed, as the drilling site is being designed in such a way that substances that are hazardous to water, such as machine oil, cannot get into the subsoil and surrounding waters. For this reason, the borehole is also lined with cement on the inside. The use of environmentally friendly drilling fluids and the professional disposal of the deep water extracted were also prerequisites for the granting of the drilling permit.

This follows up on a Framework Agreement for a large-scale green hydrogen production facility signed by the Government of Dominica last year as part of a planned Green Eco-Industrial Park. KGL, through subsidiary Kenesjay Green Dominica Limited, was also part of this Framework Agreement along with the
KGL’s responsibilities for this pre-feasibility study will involve technical and regulatory evaluations with regards to infrastructure, land use, and environmental impacts of a proposed green ammonia production facility. The company will also evaluate potential markets for green ammonia across local, regional, and international scopes.
KGL is a developer of green energy projects based in Trinidad and Tobago. This partnership recognizes the expertise and leadership of Trinidad and Tobago as a major producer of ammonia. The joint initiative also sets an example for regional cooperation working towards building a low-carbon economy in the Caribbean region.
Dominica is currently in the process of developing its first geothermal power project in Laudat. The production and reinjection wells had already been drilled and tested by the Government in a process that started more than ten years ago.

The geothermal heating plant in Schwerin, Germany had been beset by many problems since its initial target start of operations back in April 2023, but commissioning is now going according to plan and local utility company
Plans for the Schwerin geothermal were first announced back in 2018. Utilizing the geothermal resource at 1300 meters depth, the plant will supply heat to the district heating system to provide 15% of the heating needs of Schwerin, or equivalent to 2000 households.
An inauguration ceremony for the Schwerin geothermal plant was held in April 2023. However, problems were encountered due to the presence of suspended particles in the fluids, likely from the sandstone formation. Thus, filters had to be designed and installed to ensure that the fluid entering the heat exchangers meets the requirement for the equipment.
Another problem then came up with the formation of bacteria that clogged the pipes, which again had to be flushed at the end of August. This caused the second target operations date of June 2024 to be missed again.
With commissioning currently ongoing, more and more warm brine is now being extracted from the borehole and pumped back. The heat pumps will then be put into operation in the next few weeks to start supplying geothermal heat to the local district heating network. Stadtwerke Schwerin is taking a measured approach to the process to avoid further problems.

A study presented by Dayo Akindipe and Erik Witter from the
#### Recent projects set new industry-leading drilling rates
The study updates the Well Cost Simplified (WCS) model initially produced in Sandia (Lowry et al, 2017) and updated in 2022 by NREL.
The paper cites four specific projects in setting a new baseline for geothermal drilling performance. These include the Project Red and Cape Station projects of Fervo Energy, the drilling of the 16(B)78-32 production well by Utah FORGE, and the drilling of the GD-36 well by the Geysers Power Company (GPC).
These projects were considered to have recorded remarkable improvements in rates of penetration in hard rock, which have translated into industry-leading drilling rates. Drilling performance improvements have been driven by the increased use of polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits, inter-/intraproject learning (El-Sadi et al. 2024), and technology transfer from the oil and gas industry, including the implementation of the physics-based rate limiter redesign technique (Dupriest and Noynaert 2022, 2024) and multiwell pad drilling (Norbeck et al. 2024).
#### Updated drilling performance assumptions
Based on the successes of the cited projects, the study proposes updated parameters that can be used as assumptions for the baseline drilling cost curve. For instance, an average ROP of 75 ft/hr was proposed, which is a significant improvement from the 25 ft/hr average of the original 2017 model.
New technologies have also allowed for higher casing running speeds, resulting in an average of 800 feet/hour or 20 joints/hour. There is some expected variation based on casing size and the familiarity of the drilling personnel. However, the assumed average improves on the 300 feet/hour average of the original model.
With PDC bits now being the typical bit of choice for hard rock drilling, the bit cost multiplier has been increased from 1 to 2 for the updated drilling cost curve. The original 2017 model assumed that all rotary drilling will be done using roller cone bits. There is some expected variation based on bit size and whether the bit can be repaired after the bit run.
An average bit life of 50 hours was assumed for the new cost curve, which is the same assumption made by the old models. The previous figure was retained as all case study projects reported that the bits were pulled out before significant wear had occurred. This means that bit life is more of an optimization variable, rather than a hard technical limit.
Finally, a lower contingency factor was applied to the new drilling cost curve. The authors argue that improvements in drilling efficiency and advances in MWD/LWD tools means there will be less trouble time and/or nonproductive time. Thus, a reduction of the contingency factor from 15% to 10% was implemented.
#### Cost reduction for both vertical and horizontal wells
Based on the drilling data and corresponding assumptions, the authors generated new geothermal drilling cost curves. Several curves were presented, representing both horizontal and vertical drilling of both small-diameter and large-diameter wells.
In summary, the revised drilling curves indicate that drilling costs have decreased from the 2017 baseline by 12% to 24% for vertical wells and 18% to 26% for horizontal wells.
The results of the study justifies the need to update the baseline drilling cost curves used by models that estimate the costs of geothermal power such as the Geothermal Electricity Technology Evaluation Model (GETEM) and the System Advisor Model (SAM). Incorporating the revised curves will improve the accuracy of geothermal cost estimation in these models and corresponding derivative analyses, such as resource supply curves evaluation, capacity expansion modeling, and workforce development assessment.

The
This initiative was announced by Deputy Minister Lien Jin-chang during a speech at the Renewable Energy Summit Forum hosted by Mirror Weekly, where he also called for private support to complement the investment of CPC Taiwan and Taipower. Just about a month ago, CPC Taiwan announced the drilling of a 4000-meter geothermal exploration well in the Yuanshan township in Yilan County.
Stating that deep geothermal exploration requires significant financial resources, the Deputy Minister also expressed hopes that the banking industry will provide financing. If so, developers that have already invested in shallow geothermal development can apply for more funding to develop deep geothermal. In this way, the local industrial chain can also expand.
With several parallel efforts for surface exploration and drilling in geothermal projects, as well as in capacity building and policy-making, Taiwan is well-positioned to rapidly build its installed capacity for geothermal power in the coming years.

Vattenfall had been granted a permit for the biomass heating plant by the province of North Holland back in 2019. The decision was already controversial back then, with many citizens and environmental organizations bemoaning the consequences for the environment because of higher emissions.
In August 2023, the Council of State annulled the environmental permit that had been granted for the project. Vattenfall then had to resubmit the application, simultaneously also announcing that they will pause the application and evaluate alternative heat sources.
With the application now canceled altogether, Vattenfall is considering the use of geothermal energy or the waste heat from data centers for heating. According to the company, they had received active support from municipalities and provinces for the development of sustainable heat sources.
Vattenfall is involved in exploration drilling for geothermal in other areas in the Netherlands.

Work is now ongoing for what is set to become the largest geothermal system for heating, cooling, and domestic hot water supply in India at the Kushok Bankula Ripoche Airport in Leh (“Leh Airport”). The system will specifically serve the new domestic terminal building, which is still under construction.
When completed, the system will have a thermal capacity of 2500 kW, delivered by 457 boreholes, each drilled to 110-120 meters depth.
The project has been designed by
The geothermal system will operated side-by-side with a solar PV facility, thus making the airport a model for sustainable aviation infrastructure in India. The Leh Airport is located at 3500 meters elevation, making it one of the highest airports in the world.
According to an interview update given in January 2025, the Leh Airport is scheduled to be completed by October 2025.
Leh is located within the Ladakh region, where the high-pressure steam was tapped at an unexpectedly shallow depth.

Fervo Energy, working with Southern Utah University and Elemental Impact, has launched a first-of-its-kind geothermal apprenticeship program.
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
The program, administered by SUU and funded in part by Elemental, will provide those seeking new skill sets with the opportunity to learn geothermal directional drilling and well completions, while combining on-the-job training with college-level coursework on geology and energy systems. This unique approach offers pathways for traditional college students as well as adult and working learners interested in careers in the geothermal energy industry.
“Thousands of Americans work in upstream oil and gas, and with the right tools, they can easily apply their skill sets to geothermal production,”
“We can harness the full potential of this existing talent pool and attract new talent beyond current fossil fuel workers by providing on-the-ground and in-classroom training opportunities. We believe that our apprenticeship program with SUU can ignite that process, supporting local job growth across Southwest Utah.”
Just recently, Fervo Energy received the approval from the Bureau of Land Management for the Fervo Cape Geothermal Power Project, an Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) project that is aiming for a total installed capacity of 2 GW.
Already, 22 individuals working with ten different oilfield service providers operating in the area have registered for the geothermal apprenticeship program. By the end of 2024, the program aims to enroll at least 40 apprentices, providing them with an opportunity to fill an immediate workforce need upon completion of the apprenticeship.
“Southwest Utah has the resource potential to become a national clean energy hub, and we have the human potential to make that vision a reality,”Our new apprenticeship program will prepare Utahns to drive much-needed energy innovation in the communities they call home.”
Funding from Elemental Impact, a nonprofit investor in climate technology and community focused initiatives, enabled Fervo to offer this workforce training program.
“Demand for electricity is surging and expected to double in the US by 2030; geothermal sources, like those being deployed by Fervo, have the potential to meet that demand while boosting local jobs,”
“We are thrilled to support this geothermal apprenticeship program and help power the transfer of valuable skills from oil and gas professionals to the geothermal industry. This initiative, in partnership with SUU, is an essential bridge to building a local workforce and advancing the clean energy transition.”

A passive seismic campaign will be carried out in Thurgau, Switzerland to help identify subsurface structures and potential deep aquifers as part of a project to explore the use of geothermal resources. The measurement campaign still start on the 1st week of March and will take about a month.
The geophysical measurements will be done by
The TenU 2030 project had been first announced in 2021, aiming to do detailed research on the subsurface in Thurgau which can then be used for further geothermal development. In 2023, the project received a positive vote from the population of the canton as part of a wide Thurgau package of opportunities.

The upcoming measurements will use the Nodal Ambient Noise Tomography (NANT) method. This is an exploration method that is considered non-invasive and passive and thus, no seismic sources such as vibrating trucks will be used. The method uses seismic waves that originate from ambient noise that is generated by natural phenomena.
300 measuring devices will be distributed across the canton and will remain in the ground for about a month. These will then be collected again for the data to be processed.
Similar experiments have already been successfully carried out in various regions, including the cantons of Basel-Stadt, Basel-Landschaft and Aargau, as well as in Germany, France and Italy.

“This partnership will enable a deep understanding of the region’s geological potential, especially in geothermal energy,” remarked GSI Director Genera Dr. Asit Saha. Founded in 1851, the GSI has played an important role in discovering the mineral resources of India, and in advancing seismic and hydrological research.
“While CESHS is young, we are driven by the same commitment to scientific excellence. This MoU reflects our shared belief in blending traditional knowledge with cutting-edge research,”“With this partnership, we hope to tap into sustainable energy sources and bring local knowledge into national conversations on climate and energy.”
The potential of Arunachal Pradesh as one of India’s most promising but unexplored regions for geothermal energy was also emphasized during the signing ceremony. Indeed, Arunachal Pradesh has been the focus of many geothermal studies through recent years. The CESHS had previously collaborated with Norwegian and Icelandic institutes on a field sampling campaign in Arunachal Pradesh, following an agreement with Oil India Limited (OIL) to carry out research studies in the region, including an MT survey.

The Government of Mexico through the National Institute of Electricity and Clean Energy (INEEL) has launched an international public tender (LE-18-T0K-018T0K001-I-125-2024) for drilling services for the drilling of four geothermal exploration well in two sites in Mexico. More specifically, three wells are planned in Cerro Prieto in Baja California, and one well in Las Tres Vírgenes in Baja California Sur.
The deadline for submission of bids will be on the 9th of December 2024.
Instructions on how to acquire the bid documents are available
An amount of $51 million will be mobilized through a contingent donation by the Clean Technology Fun (CTF) which will be activated if the exploration drilling is not successful. Moreover, the project is supported by the Geothermal Risk Transfer and Financing Program (PFRTG), as well as the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), the Ministry of Energy, and the National Financial Situation, aiming to mitigate exploratory risks.
Although Mexico has remained one of the global leaders in installed geothermal power generation capacity, its growth has been minimal for the better part of the last decade. The industry remains optimistic under the rule of newly elected President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has set a target for Mexico to attain 45% of the country’s electricity to come from renewable sources.

The National Electric Energy Company of Honduras (“Technology Selection and Plant Development for the Namasigüe Geothermal Project.”
Proposals will the tender will be accepted only until 21 January 2025
The scope for the project will include:
* Selection of the best applicable technology based on existing results, considering that the system is of low and medium enthalpy based on applied geothermometers
* Schematic and modeling of the proposed plant, considering social and environmental variables applicable to the project.
The Namasigüe geothermal project is located between the municipalities of Namasigüe and El Triunfo, in the department of Choluteca. This project has undergone technical and financial evaluation for the generation of electricity using geothjermal resources, in addition to social and environmental work that has allowed the sustainability of the activities done to prepare a Geothermal Conceptual Model.
The hydrothermal system is linked to a fault system associated with the Guayape fault, with a natural anomalous heat gradient. Technical variables have been identified that allow the probabilistic evaluation of the resource.
Honduras currently has one operational geothermal power plant, the 35-MW Platanares power plant that was inaugurated in 2018. In 2020 Ormat indicated plans of expanding the capacity of Platanares by 20 MW.

Vulcan Energy has started the production of lithium hydroxide from geothermal brine-derived lithium at the CLEOP facility in Frankfurt, Germany.
![](

![](
From the downstream CLEOP facility, Vulcan will be supplying lithium hydroxide for the battery-grade qualification process with the company’s offtake partners including, Stellantis, Renault, LG, and Umicore. This process will take place simultaneously with the construction of Vulcan’s Phase One commercial plant.
Phase One of the project, designated Lionheart, will supply approximately 24,000 tonnes per annum of lithium hydroxide, enough for approximately 500,000 electric vehicles (EVs) per annum
The CLEOP facility complements Vulcan’s upstream Lithium Extraction Optimization Plant (LEOP) in Landau, which was officially opened in late 2023. The LEOP is where lithium chloride is produced from geothermal brine using the company’s Adsorption-type Direct Lithium Extraction (A-DLE) technology.
The Company’s Phase One upstream and downstream plants will exclude fossil fuels in both the extraction and processing of lithium. This makes Vulcan’s supply chain one of the lowest cost and lowest carbon footprint for lithium production globally. The Phase One process will also involve the co-production of heat and power from geothermal resource, the excess of which can be supplied to local communities.
Recently, Vulcan’s operations were assigned Dark Green by S&P Global Ratings, the highest ever received by a Metals and Mining company globally. S&P Global Ratings’ methodology includes six shades, with a Dark Green rating awarded to activities that correspond to the long-term vision of the low-carbon climate resilient future

Cindrigo has announced their exit from the Slatina 3 geothermal project in Croatia, instead realigning focus on newly acquired geothermal assets in Germany.

previous news of a request for a six-month extension of the exploration license for the project from the company tot the Croatian Hydrocarbon Agency.
With this decision, the UK-based renewable energy company shifts their focus to newly acquired geothermal assets, specifically three geothermal projects in the Upper Rhine Valley in Germany.
In mid-2022, Cindrigo (through Cindrigo Geothermal Limited) announced the 90% acquisition of Croatian geothermal firm EES Dravacel Energetika (Dravacel), through which the Slatina 3 project was to be developed. The company had announced plans to start drilling earlier this year, but these were halted pending the decision on the license extension request.
Cindrigo cites several reasons for their decision to exit the Croatian geothermal market, among these the “licensing delays and the lack of transparency from the Croatian Hydrocarbon Agency” and a higher expected output from their German prospects.
The company’s withdrawal from Slatina 3 also terminated its loan agreements with Petroline LLC and Tri Ri Asset Management.
#### Expiration of license terms and potential new co-owner
According to Croatia’s Ministry of Economy, the decision to not extend the exploration license was due to Cindrigo already receiving the maximum number of license extensions. The developer was also cited as not meeting the deadlines for drilling, and that the concession had rightfully expired as of April 2024.
Documentation submitted to the Zagreb Commercial Court indicates that Cindrigo had initiated bankruptcy proceedings at Dravacel. However, the documents also show that Swedish corporation Danir AB holds a 49.1% stake in Cindrigo Geothermal Ltd. as part of a loan agreement for £4.5 million. The new ownership framework for Dravacel will likely be clarified once the bankruptcy proceedings are completed. Prior to Cindrigo’s acquisition, 100% ownership of Dravacel was with entrepreneur Marinko Mikuli?.

With new technology and exciting opportunities to scale up energy production, the geothermal effort has the potential to change the energy landscape in Texas and create a more reliable pathway to a cleaner, greener grid. While Austin Energy is already the most environmentally sustainable utility in Texas, far exceeding statewide and national averages for carbon-free energy, it always seeks new ways to provide clean, reliable energy to the grid.
As part of its Resource, Generation and Climate Protection Plan to 2035, Austin Energy worked with stakeholders to understand how to reflect the community’s priorities of reliability, affordability and environmental sustainability. Geothermal energy production is a valuable tool in the utility’s efforts to strengthen the grid and keep costs down while continuing toward a greener future.
“Geothermal technology for energy generation holds great promise and we are excited to advance innovation in this space,” “This pilot will allow us to learn about any unforeseen challenges and better understand if those challenges can be overcome safely and economically. Based on what we learn, in the future, we may be able to scale up geothermal to further diversify our clean, renewable supply portfolio.”
“Geothermal energy has been an interest of mine since I began as a Council Member and engaged in Austin Energy’s carbon-free energy generation planning and the reliability of the electric grid. I am also enthusiastic about the types of geothermal technology used for heating and cooling in the District 1 community at Whisper Valley,”“Our electric utility focuses on innovative solutions to our pressing energy needs and it’s exciting to consider the possibilities geothermal energy will have for Austin and the state.”
“Austin Energy’s commitment to innovation is truly commendable,”“By moving forward with this groundbreaking technology, they’re not only embracing a cleaner future but also paving the way for transformative energy solutions. Their support has been instrumental in bringing this disruptive technology to market, and we’re excited to see the impact it will have on the community and the energy sector as a whole.”
Austin, Texas is also the site of the inaugural geothermal heating and cooling project Bedrock Energy, which was just completed earlier this year at the Penn Field mixed-use office and retail campus.

New Zealand Parliament Member and Resources and Regional Development Minister Shane Jones expressed strong support for the expansion of geothermal energy utilization in the country during the recently held New Zealand First conference. During his speech, Jones declared that funding would be sought to develop “a new frontier of development and use the geothermal energy in our country to ensure that the cost of energy sinks to a low level.”
Of particular focus for the expression of support was the research being done for supercritical geothermal resources in New Zealand. “Wouldn’t it be great if we were the first nation in the world to draw from a new energy source — supercritical, deep-seated, infinite source of geothermal energy?”
had just recently published a report highlighting the potential for supercritical geothermal development in New Zealand. The report states that supercritical geothermal can provide up to 2000 MW of electricity generation capacity by 2050, which can contribute approximately 35% of New Zealand’s energy needs.
Furthermore, the report indicates that New Zealand can benefit from the massive electricity generation potential of supercritical geothermal can be achieved economically by 2037, and conservatively by 2049.
#### Government support sought for initial drilling
“We know we have those resources, we know we’ve been modelling them, but we need to prove it by drilling,”
In his speech, Jones indicated plans to provide the funding for this drilling. “I don’t think that it’s reasonable to expect the [energy companies] to spend $60 million, $80m, $100m, whatever it might be, for the initial well drilling, they don’t seem to be motivated to do that.”
Kennie Tsui, Chief Executive of the “continue the effort to explore further geothermal resources like what we did in the 50’s and 80’s.”

![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 28 Feb 2025
Michigan utilities company Consumers Energy has received a grant for a feasibility study on transitioning from natural gas to networked geothermal heating.
![](
![](
![](
Tracy Wimmers, spokesperson for Consumers Energy, said that the initial upfront costs for the study will be covered by grant funding or a combination of sources. She also emphasized the benefits of making the switch to geothermal, such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions and lower energy bills.
“We want to be looking at places where not only do those customers most likely need to see their energy costs reduced significantly because they’re struggling to pay their bills, but also neighborhoods that have had historically low air quality, because of the emissions reductions that will come from switching to a system like this,”
In September, Consumers Energy received a $425,000 grant through the Renewable Energy and Electrification Infrastructure Enhancement and Development Grant Program, which supports work on renewable energy and electrification infrastructure.
Wimmers added that the plan is to launch a pilot project after the study has been completed. “This is just the beginning, the earliest portion, where we’re taking a look at these locations and doing the math, looking at trying to find those ideal diverse neighborhoods and figuring out what is, where can we do the most good on those three fronts.”
Networked geothermal projects are being evaluated in man US states, including in Massachusetts and Maryland. The networked geothermal pilot project in Framingham, which went online in mid-2024, is a notable example of how customers can benefit from lower heating an cooling costs.

Germany's BVEG and DGMK have published the final version of the guidelines for economic assessment of geological risks of deep geothermal projects.
![](

The “Guidelines for economic assessment of geological risks of deep geothermal projects.”
The full document is available at the BVEG website in both
The guideline provides a standardised and generally applicable methodology for dealing with geological uncertainties in hydrothermal and petrothermal energy production. The aim is to provide a transparent, transferable, and reusable guideline for assessing and quantifying the geological probability of success and natural geological variability. The guideline has been written primarily for the German market and similar low-enthalpy regions.
Such a geological assessment is essential for the responsible and economical use of investments and subsidies. Quantifying the geological probability of success is the necessary basis for or against investment decisions. In addition, the proposed assessment approach enables a traceable forecast of the range of possible geological scenarios and their probability of occurrence. This creates the necessary basis for a proper subsurface and surface planning and realistic cost estimates.
This guideline primarily focuses on hydrothermal systems with several boreholes that are to be drilled deeper than 400 metres. The feasibility and economic viability of geothermal systems are analysed, where thermal water flows not only through the boreholes and surface facility but also through the subsurface geological formations.
The final version has been extensively revised compared to the gray print of April 2024. The BVEG would like to thank all the geothermal operators, authorities, engineering service providers, private individuals and ministries, that provided constructive suggestions that were intensively discussed and incorporated into the guide.

* Registration:
The Latrobe Valley in Victoria exhibits an elevated geothermal gradient and is therefore of high interest for geothermal developments, with a geothermal doublet already in place at the local aquatic centre, providing temperatures of up to 68°C.
In this talk, Latrobe Valley, aquifer modelling and geothermal doublet planning, with the aim of providing heating to a large-scale aquaculture facility and Australia’s first energy from waste plant. The proposed geothermal development with a heating supply of up to 14 MW would be the largest in Australia to date.

Project ATLiS, which will produce lithium from geothermal brine in California, has received conditional commitment from the US DOE for a $1.22 billion loan.

California-based
ATLiS submitted its application to LPO in May 2023. Today’s announcement reinforces the Department of Energy’s commitment to strengthening the nation’s manufacturing competitiveness and ensuring the country’s energy future is built by Americans, for Americans.
The company had previously signed a binding lithium supply contract with Ford Motor Company for sustainably produced lithium hydroxide.
#### About Project ATLiS
The facility is expected to produce up to 20,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide annually, enough for approximately 52 GWh of lithium-ion batteries per year.
The ATLiS facility will use a technology called direct lithium extraction (DLE) to recover lithium from Salton Sea geothermal brine. DLE technologies are applicable in many lithium brine and clay resources across the United States, allowing economically competitive extraction where impurities or lower lithium concentrations would otherwise limit commercial opportunities. DLE also requires less water and land versus conventional extraction methods from brines, such as evaporation ponds.
Project ATLiS will be the first facility to utilize the process at commercial scale in the United States. ATLiS will deploy a proprietary DLE technology called ILiAD™ (developed by ESM ILiAD LLC, another EnergySource Minerals subsidiary) for lithium recovery, which has been piloted with various brine resources across the United States and internationally, including in Utah, Texas, and Nevada, in addition to onsite in California.
![]( diagram of the lithium extraction process of EnergySource Minerals (source: EnergySource Minerals)
The facility will be sited next to an existing geothermal plant, which will supply the lithium-rich brine from the subsurface geothermal field located over one mile underground. After impurities are removed from the brine, the lithium will be separated out using the ILiAD™ DLE technology.
The lithium-depleted brine will be returned to the geothermal plant for reinjection into the geothermal reservoir, and the lithium will be further purified, crystallized, and packaged into battery-grade material. The brine features additional recoverable critical minerals supporting America’s industrial base, including zinc and manganese, which ATLiS expects to extract and commercialize.
Prior DOE analysis has estimated that potential lithium production from the Salton Sea known geothermal resource area may exceed 4 million metric tons, which can produce over 10,000 GWh of battery capacity. This project supports the Administration’s efforts to strengthen supply chains that are key to national energy security, reduce reliance on economic competitors like China, and unlock America’s tremendous domestic lithium resource

The 174-MW Tauhara geothermal power plant by
Earlier this year, Contact Energy announced the completion of a 30-day test of the power facility, thus supplying power to the grid albeit at a reduced capacity. At the full 174-MW capacity, the Tauhara geothermal power station can supply electricity to 200,000 homes in New Zealand. This accounts for about 3.5% of New Zealand’s electricity and creates savings of 500,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year, or equivalent to removing 220,000 petrol cars from the roads.
“It’s a red-letter day for New Zealand’s transition to a renewable energy future and a welcome addition to the country’s energy supply,”
“Our new geothermal power station at Tauhara, demonstrates Contact’s continued ability to invest, build and deliver world-class assets for the benefit of all New Zealanders. Geothermal energy plays a crucial role in creating a reliable supply of electricity. It’s also where New Zealand leads the way with technology and ingenuity, so it’s exciting to expand our fleet of geothermal assets as well as to have two more geothermal power stations on the way.”
Contact Energy has at least two more large-scale geothermal power projects in the advanced stages of development. About a month ago, the energy company announced the start of grid supply of the Te Huka 3 power plant, which will ramp up to the maximum 51.4 MW capacity by the end of 2024.
More recently, Contact Energy engaged with Ormat Technologies for EPC of the 101-MW Te Mihi 2 geothermal power plant, which is expected to go online by 2027.

The Kaynarpinar geothermal exploitation license is located at the eastern part of Turkiye, in the eastern Anatolia region, within the district border of Bingöl city with a coverage of 1.2 km2
A few drilled shallow wells, reaching a depth of 100 meters, exhibit a temperature of 80 °C with an artesian flow reflecting the active geothermal system hidden deep down below. Given Bingöl’s untapped potential, these geothermal resources can enhance the region socio-economically and stimulate activity through both direct and indirect uses.

The start of exploration drilling follows up on extensive exploration studies conducted by Ignis Energy in the license area. These include magnetotelluric surveys, geochemical analyses, drone imaging, and geological studies. Using the collected data sets, Ignis Energy developed a comprehensive conceptual model, which the exploration well will put to the test.
Ignis Energy has been active in expanding their geothermal portfolio in other regions, recently securing leases in California and Nevada.

The second borehole, GT-2, had been drilled to a depth of 2665 meters. There is still further testing to be done before the actual thermal and physicochemical parameters of the well can be verified. However, the doublet (with well GT-1, drilled in 2019) forms the basis for geothermal heating in Turek.
Drilling of the GT-2 well was done by
When operational by 2026, Turek will have the 11th geothermal heating plant in Poland. Nine of these are already operational, while the tenth heating plant in Konin is in the process of obtaining permits before it starts operations.

#### Capital Increase Requirement Within 6 Months
Within six months following EMRA’s approval of the share transfer, the pre-license holder must increase its paid-in capital by 25% of the main investment cost and document that this capital increase is sourced from abroad. The documentation must then be submitted to EMRA. The regulation aims to strengthen geothermal energy companies with foreign capital.
#### Unit Investment Cost for Geothermal Energy: 50 Million TRY /MWm
EMRA has set unit investment costs for each energy source to calculate the foreign capital increase. For geothermal energy, this cost is set at 50 million TRY (approximately USD 1.45 million) per MWm. This figure will serve as the basis for determining the capital increase to be provided by foreign investors.
#### Penalties for Non-Compliance
If the specified capital increase obligation is not fulfilled, the approval of the share transfer will be deemed invalid, and the company’s pre-license will be revoked. Additionally, the increased capital amount must be maintained until the production license is obtained; otherwise, the license will also be canceled.
#### Exceptions in the Regulation
According to the Energy Market Licensing Regulation, direct or indirect share transfers in pre-license holder companies is permitted only through foreign-sourced capital. This regulation makes compliance with EMRA’s capital increase requirement mandatory for geothermal energy companies in Türkiye seeking foreign investment.

Following a series of production tests to verify the availability, temperature, and chemical composition of the formation water, the 20-MWt geothermal heating plant is scheduled to be commissioned in 2028, with additional plants to follow. OMV and Wien Energie estimate that the technology has the potential to meet the heating needs of around 200,000 households in Vienna.
In late 2023, OMV and Wien Energie announced the founding of the “deeep” joint venture which aims to develop 200 MW of geothermal district heating. The site at Aspern was selected as the first project site of the joint venture. By the latter half of 2024, preparation work of the drilling site was already underway.

“This deep geothermal plant is a forward-looking project that sets an example for our city. We are not only generating energy, but also strengthening our supply independence and our economic position,”
“With the first deeep geothermal plant for Vienna, we will generate even more climate-neutral district heating. As we will be less dependent on gas imports, this will contribute to security of supply and price stability,”
#### A unique knowledge of the geology
The wells at the Aspern site will be drilled to target the “Aderklaaer Konglomerat” formation, a natural hot water reservoir with waters of around 100 °C. Three wells will be drilled for the pilot plant – a pilot well for exploration, maintenance, and protection, a production well, and a reinjection well.

“OMV has a unique knowledge of the geology of the Vienna Basin. We are applying this know-how, combined with many years of experience in exploration and production, together with Wien Energie in our innovative district heating project for Vienna,”
“Geothermal energy is an important element of our 2030 strategy, with which OMV is driving forward its transformation into an integrated sustainable chemicals, fuels, and energy company,”

#### Approval of the Fervo Cape project in Utah
The BLM has announced the approval of the
With this approval, the BLM has now approved nearly 32 gigawatts of clean energy projects on public lands, including 42 projects approved under the Biden-Harris administration.
#### Proposed categorical exclusion
The BLM has also proposed a new categorical exclusion (CX) that will apply to geothermal resource confirmation operations plan of up to 20 acres. This can include the drilling of wells to confirm the existence of a geothermal resources (including core drilling and temperature gradient wells), to improve injection support, or to demonstrate the connections between wells.
Under current regulations, geothermal developers must conduct two separate environmental reviews: one for initial exploration drilling and another to fully test the geothermal resource, even if both have similar environmental impacts. The proposal would apply only to geothermal resource confirmation operations on public lands and split estates. Further geothermal development would still require additional environmental analysis. Based on previous DOE analysis, these permitting actions could significantly reduce permitting timelines and capital costs of geothermal deployment.
Under the National Environmental Policy Act,?categorical exclusions (CXs)?are categories of actions that typically do not have significant impacts on the human environment. When used appropriately, CXs eliminate the need for an environmental assessment (EA) as part of the permitting process. CXs cannot be applied in cases with special circumstances, such as potential impacts to endangered species, in which case an EA must still be conducted.
The proposal will be published in the Federal Register in the coming days to begin a 30-day public comment period.
#### Responsible geothermal development on public lands
These announcement follow the recent BLM Nevada State Office’s geothermal lease sale which saw healthy interest from private investors making it the most successful sale since 2008 and the second-most ever. The BLM sold 64 parcels covering nearly 218,000 acres, bringing in over $7.8 million in high bids. This marks a sharp increase from the previous year’s sale of 96,600 acres for just over $1 million, demonstrating the growing interest in geothermal development on public lands.
“Geothermal energy is one of our greatest untapped clean energy resources on public lands,” “Today’s actions are part of the Department’s work to deliver on new opportunities, new technologies, and new solutions in geothermal energy that support the Biden-Harris administration’s commitment to create jobs, economic growth, and clean carbon-free electricity for communities throughout the West.”
“The BLM is committed to supporting the responsible growth of geothermal energy on public lands,”“We need all the tools in the toolbox to reach a clean energy future, and this proposed categorical exclusion will be helpful in accelerating the process of locating new geothermal resources.”

Preparation of the construction site for the 10-MW geothermal power plant in Dominica is currently ongoing, and construction is expected to start by early 2025.
The progress of the Caribbean island nation’s first geothermal power project was announced by Dominica’s Minister of Energy Dr. Vince Henderson during an interview with state-owned Radio DBS. The Minister further added that the excavation of the site has been completed and that the arrival of power plant equipment is expected by the end of the year.
Before the end of 2023, the Government of Dominica signed an agreement with Ormat Technologies Inc. that will have Ormat finance the construction of the power plant, as well as operate and maintain it. After 25 years, ownership of the power plant and other associated assets will be transferred to the Government of Dominica.
Dr. Henderson also added that the construction of the transmission network to support the power plant is about to start. This phase of the project was awarded to a company from India following a tender announced back in mid-2023.
“75 percent of the lines will be on the ground, so that is also going to require some excavation. Fortunately, it will not be too disruptive in the communities, but we want to always ensure that we have safeguards for lives, livelihoods, and properties,”

Service companies have improved geothermal drilling efficiency by optimizing drill bits, bottom hole assemblies (BHAs), and drilling fluids.
Advanced drill bits made from durable materials like PDC and innovative geometries increase penetration rates while reducing wear. Modeled BHA designs coupled with real-time monitoring enhance drilling performance and wellbore placement while minimizing non-productive time. Drilling fluids have been refined for better heat resistance, lubricity, and performance in high-pressure, high-temperature conditions. These advancements help operators drill faster, more efficiently, and at lower costs.

This variable-spread loan is financed by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and has a maturity of 30 years, including a six-year grace period.
LAGEO, the state-owned company responsible for generating electricity using El Salvador’s geothermal resources, is the implementing agency of the “Geothermal Energy for Sustainable and Inclusive Development Project in El Salvador”
“The government’s commitment is to ensure that all Salvadorans have access to clean and affordable energy. This World Bank-financed project is an important step to strengthen our energy system and promote sustainable and inclusive development,”
The project will provide financial resources for the following:
* Drilling campaign to confirm geothermal resources, including well drilling and assessments to confirm and characterize geothermal resource availability in the Chinameca field;
* Investment in Geothermal Electricity Generation Capacity, that will finance the construction of a geothermal power plant, including the steam and brine piping system
* Implementation of social and environmental programs to promote the direct use of geothermal waste heat for new economic opportunities in the communities around the geothermal plant within the Dry Corridor; implementation of mitigation measures for environmental and social impacts; and development of studies to support the creation of the Geothermal Center of Excellence that will facilitate local development and green job creation
* Technical Assistance and Project Implementation Support, to support LaGeo in strengthening its technical and administrative capacity to execute the project.
With this funding, LAGEO is now moving forward with the installation of an initial 25-MW power plant in the Chinameca geothermal field. Exploratory geothermal work will also be conducted at the same field to facilitate the development of up to 40 MW of additional power generation capacity.
During its construction and operation, the geothermal plant will generate jobs for people living in the communities surrounding the Chinameca Geothermal Field, located 115 km east of San Salvador. Additionally, local communities will be able to use the geothermal heat for direct uses, such as food drying and processing, thus benefitting the development of local agribusinesses.
“This project demonstrates our long-standing collaboration with the government of El Salvador in building a more resilient and prosperous future. Together with LAGEO, we will work towards the success of this intervention, which will contribute to reducing emissions and creating green jobs
This project will support the further growth of the geothermal sector in El Salvador, which currently has a total of 204 MWe of installed geothermal capacity between the Ahuachapan and Berlin geothermal power plants. LaGeo is also now in the process of testing a new 7-MW binary geothermal power plant in Berlin, which is expected to be operational later this year.

With surface facilities completed and drilling progressing, Eavor is expecting to generate geothermal power at the Geretsried, Germany site by 1st half of 2025.
![](
![](
![](
In an interview given to German publication Merkur,
The project in Geretsried will be the first commercial-scale deployment of Eavor’s unique Eavor-Loop technology which makes use of several subsurface closed loops to harness geothermal energy and generate power. We had previously reported on in early 2024 an update on the drilling progress of Eavor, simultaneous with the power plant construction. By the end of 2024, the total measured depth of drilling had reached 8000 meters.
Land provides some details on how Eavor changed their drilling approach for the project. The initial plan was to drill two wells vertically to depths of 4500 meters before drilling horizontally for 3000 to 3500 meters to form a loop. This process will then be repeated to create twelve loops.
However, Eavor is now planning to create only six loops on Loop 1, as this is the number necessary to operate the power plant. Three loops have already been finished and drilling of the fourth loop is ongoing. The company also decided to pressure test each loop immediately upon completion of drilling.
Although the new approach presented some challenges, it also provided valuable learning experience for Eavor. Land describes the delays as “part of the learning curve”
Drilling work at the Geretsried site started in mid-2023. The goal for the site is to generate approximately 64 MW of thermal output or 8.2 MW of electrical output, thus saving approximately 44,000 tons of CO2 equivalent per year. The project has received a great deal of financial and political support, becoming the first recipient of the Canada Growth Fund and securing financing of over EUR 130 million in early 2024.
Eavor managing director Daniel Mölk emphasizes that what the company is doing in Geretsried has never been done before. “We were extremely happy when we successfully joined the first two laterals into a loop with a drilled length of around 8,000 meters.”
Eavor has since secured agreements for similar geothermal projects in the German cities of Hanover and Neu-Ulm.

The Geysers is a vast geothermal field that has provided the surrounding region with renewable energy for nearly 65 years. But due to over development, the steam pressure from those reservoirs began to decline in the 1980s. The future of the power generation was threatened, so an innovative solution was needed.
Wastewater from Lake County was identified as a solution and construction of the Southeast Geysers Effluent Pipeline began in 1995, with delivery of recycled water to The Geysers commencing in 1997. The 40-mile pipeline delivers approximately 8 million gallons of recycled water daily to The Geysers for reinjection into the reservoir, helping maintain steam pressure. Partnership on the Santa Rosa Geysers Recharge Project followed and today, these two projects provide up to 20 million gallons of reclaimed water daily, replenishing the reservoir.
#### Modeling decades’ worth of subsurface data
Seequent’s software allows Calpine to consolidate all aboveground and subsurface data collected through the decades into a model that informs reservoir management and the planning of future wells. “We have hundreds of active geothermal wells and dozens of active water reinjection wells. It allows us to render the surface data, the subsurface data, and the position of all the different geothermal wells,”
“When we’re planning new water injection wells, we really have to understand where that water is going to go in the subsurface, and the software really allows us to visualize in great detail and at high accuracy.”
Meanwhile, the software tools of Bentley, Seequent’s parent company, allows for modeling of the above-ground component of pumping recycled water for reinjection into the Geysers field.
#### Engineering solutions for sustainability goals
Seequent has been selected as an official partner of the UNESCO World Engineering Day for Sustainable Development (WED) 2025, which celebrates the contributions of the engineering profession in pursuit of the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. The video on the Geysers geothermal field is part of a year-long campaign of events, films, and related articles highlighting engineering achievements in the field of sustainable development.
The campaign aims to act as a springboard for governments, UN-associated organisations, policymakers, educators and leaders in the public and private sectors to raise awareness of the importance of engineering.
_“Seequent is honoured to be a partner for World Engineering Day 2025._ Engineers play a crucial role in enhancing our lives and our interaction with the planet. Seequent
_“A comprehensive understanding of the ground beneath us is essential for achieving the world’s sustainable development goals. From managing ground risk and reducing emissions on infrastructure projects to sourcing critical minerals more sustainably, increasing our use of renewable energy, and managing groundwater and environmental risk – our technology is at the forefront of supporting these efforts. As the Bentley Subsurface Company, we bridge the built and natural environment, enabling organisations to better understand ground conditions and their impact on the design, build and operation of infrastructure.”_
Addressing the significance of WED, Jacques de Mereuil, Executive Director of the WFEO, says: “World Engineering Day 2025 is all about putting engineering in the global spotlight, showing how engineers are leading the way in the effort to meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal targets, and inspiring the next generation to find out more about what a career in engineering has to offer.”
Use of Seequent’s software by Calpine is a great example of
“It’s what sustainable engineering is all about – harnessing reliable, clean energy for generations to come,”

* Cardak and Honaz Districts
The report thoroughly evaluates the status of geothermal activities in these areas, the challenges encountered, and necessary future steps. It also emphasizes that these resources could be further utilized in areas such as thermal health tourism and agricultural greenhouse heating, beyond just energy production.
Located at the intersection of the Aegean, Central Anatolia, and Mediterranean regions, Denizli is one of Türkiye’s richest cities in geothermal resources. The hot water sources emerging along the Buyuk Menderes and Curuksu grabens hold significant potential for both energy and tourism. However, ensuring the sustainable utilization of this potential is crucial for the region’s development.
#### Promoting further geothermal growth in Denizli
The report not only highlights the contributions of Denizli’s natural wealth to the region and the country but also presents solutions to sectoral challenges. Special emphasis is placed on increasing infrastructure investments and strengthening public-private sector cooperation. The report clearly demonstrates that, with proper utilization, the region could experience significant growth in energy, tourism, and agriculture.
This report is a product of the Chamber of Geological Engineers’ extensive efforts in the field of geothermal energy. The Chamber has long been a key platform for promoting the effective use of geothermal resources through symposia, workshops, and professional training. Reports prepared under the leadership of the Geothermal Resources and Natural Mineral Waters Commission serve as guiding documents for both local administrations and investors.
Continuing such studies is crucial for maximizing Denizli’s geothermal wealth and its contributions to the national economy and sustainable energy goals. The Chamber of Geological Engineers had previously also published geothermal reports on the Nigde and Ankara regions.

A cooperation agreement has been signed between Iceland and Italy, stipulating increased cooperation in the field of geothermal issues, both bilaterally and within the network of international organizations. The agreement was signed by Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson, Minister of the Environment, Energy and Climate, and Stefano Nicoletti , Italy’s ambassador to Iceland, on behalf of Italy’s Minister of Energy.
Guðlaugur Þór said at the signing that it was appropriate and timely that the two countries with the longest history and most knowledge in the field of using geothermal energy in Europe signed an agreement on cooperation in that field.
Nicoletti said there are many similarities in the use of geothermal energy in the two states. The Italians had built their first geothermal plant in 1905 and had a lot of experience and knowledge. They also shared their knowledge with other countries like Iceland. The agreement that has now been signed is a new beginning of closer cooperation, where it is important to bring experts and the private sector to the table.
Geothermal energy is an underutilized renewable resource in Europe and globally, and there are sometimes unnecessary regulatory barriers to its use, often due to ignorance. In the fight against climate change, the use of geothermal energy should be welcomed, but no thresholds should be set. The relationship between Iceland and Italy would be good, and cooperation in geothermal matters would improve it even more.

Under the Joint Study Agreement, “Using Geothermal Electricity for Beyond Energy,”
Following an initial technical study, PGEO and Pertagas will proceed to a feasibility study to evaluate investment potential and business scheme development, considering factors such as resource allocation, selection of technology, and implementation timeline. The project will be implemented in a Geothermal Working Area (WKP) of PGEO, taking into account locations with both potential and support for the production of the green fuels.
The collaboration between PGEO and Pertagas in green fuel production is part of PGE’s strategy to not only develop geothermal energy in the upstream sector, but also expand its utilization downstream through the development of an integrated green industrial ecosystem.
PGEO had just recently entered into a partnership with France-based Genvia to collaborate in developing green hydrogen production through the integration of advanced solid oxide electrolyzer (SOEL) technology.
“The synergy between PGE and Pertagas will accelerate the development of geothermal energy potential as a clean energy source. This is in line with PGE’s commitment as a leader in the geothermal industry and Pertagas’ role in opening horizons in various new business opportunities to support Pertamina in becoming a green energy giant,”
Pertagas is Indonesia’s national energy distribution infrastructure company, managing almost 3000 kilometers of gas transmission pipeline and has expertise in managing infrastructure for the storage and distribution of green fuels.
“As part of the Pertamina Group, Pertagas is ready to contribute to the development of infrastructure that supports the green energy ecosystem. This collaboration with PGE is an important step to start efforts to supply green hydrogen and green ammonia to the domestic and export markets,”

PLN East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) is setting an ambitious goal to increase renewable energy generation to 198 MW by 2030, with a strong focus on geothermal power plants (PLTPs). PLN NTT is a division of Indonesia’s state-owned electric utility company, PT PLN (Persero). This unit is responsible for managing electricity generation, distribution, and infrastructure development in the East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) region. East Nusa Tenggara is the southernmost province of Indonesia. It comprises the eastern portion of the Lesser Sunda Islands, facing the Indian Ocean in the south and the Flores Sea in the north
At an event yesterday, PLN Electricity System Planning Manager I Wayan Adi Hari emphasized that achieving this target will require collaboration with international partners and advancements in supporting technologies.
Geothermal as the Primary Renewable Energy Source
NTT’s renewable energy mix was projected to reach 17.8% in 2023 and 23% in 2024, but current figures indicate that only 10% of the region’s total 470 MW power capacity comes from renewables.
Existing Renewable Energy in NTT (as of 2023): 50 solar power plants (PLTS) – 19.2 MW, 9 micro-hydro plants (PLTMH) – 6.77 MW, 3 geothermal power plants (PLTP) – 20.5 MW.
Given geothermal’s higher capacity output, PLN NTT plans to prioritize PLTP development to increase the renewable energy ratio. Flores, which once achieved a 26% renewable energy mix, serves as a key geothermal hub for the region.
Planned Geothermal Power Plants
To meet the 23% renewable energy target, PLN NTT is developing several new geothermal power plants, including:
* Ulumbu PLTP – 20 MW
* Sokoria PLTP – 25 MW
* Mataloko PLTP – 20 MW
* Atadei PLTP – 10 MW
However, permitting, community engagement, and infrastructure challenges remain obstacles to large-scale geothermal development.
Addressing Electrification Challenges in NTT
NTT’s electrification ratio has reached 96.37% as of January 2025, but four regions remain in the “red zone” with limited access to electricity: Sabu Raijua, South Central Timor, East Manggarai, Southwest Sumba. Additionally, 35 villages in East Sumba still lack electricity due to their remote locations and limited grid expansion.
A Collaborative Effort for Sustainable Energy
With strong government and international support, PLN NTT aims to expand geothermal energy production, enhance rural electrification, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
Geothermal development in Flores and surrounding areas could play a crucial role in achieving Indonesia’s renewable energy goals while providing sustainable power solutions for future generations.

Originally running on coal, NGM is currently in the process of modifying the 242-MW TS Power Plant to use cleaner-burning natural gas as a fuel source. The partnership with Quaise explores the possibility of utilizing deep geothermal energy, further reducing the power plant’s fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
The partnership underscores the unique capabilities of deep geothermal to decarbonize heavy industrial sectors like mining, and marks the first commercial pilot for retrofitting a fossil fuel power plant to accommodate geothermal heat. This is well aligned with NGM’s 2030 GHG reduction roadmap targets. NGM had also just recently completed the construction of a 200-MW solar power plant.
“Nevada Gold Mines is targeting an overall 30% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030,”“We continue to pursue initiatives that economically reduce our reliance on carbon-based electricity sources. Quaise offers a unique prospective solution to hybridize our on-site power generation with clean geothermal heat.”
#### Decarbonizing the mining sector with deep geothermal
The partnership highlights two key reasons why going deeper is a necessity for geothermal to achieve a significant share of the global energy mix by 2050. The first is location. Deep geothermal wells can be drilled in more places around the world, even next to existing power plants. The second is economics. Deep geothermal can compete with fossil fuels on cost while eliminating carbon emissions by producing as much as 10x more power per well than traditional geothermal.
“Deep geothermal can decarbonize critical industrial processes like mining because of its superior power density,”“Our millimeter wave drilling technology is the key to unlocking high-grade geothermal heat, repositioning fossil-fired assets for a clean energy future.”
An excellent example of deep geothermal helping to reduce the carbon footprint of mining operations is in the Lihir Island of Papua New Guinea where a geothermal power plant has been operating since 2001. Several similar projects are being evaluated elsewhere, including in Toka Tindung in Sulawesi, Indonesia, and in the Colluli mining project in Eritrea.
The retrofit of NGM’s TS Power Plant positions Quaise to go from drilling field trials to full commercial deployment. The ongoing partnership opens a prospective new paradigm in clean energy for industrial use applications worldwide.

Geothermal developer
This initiative aligns with Hillerød Forsyning’s ambition to completely phase out natural gas and reduce the consumption of biomass while providing green, inexpensive heating to an increasing number of citizens as the district heating network expands.
“Utilising geothermal energy for district heating is an obviously good idea and an ambition that the board have worked hard to make a reality. The collaboration with Innargi enables us to secure CO2-free heat that neither Trump nor Putin can shut down,”
A geothermal reservoir at two to three kilometers beneath the city is expected to host geothermal water at a temperature of 60 to 80 °C. If the pumps in the geothermal plants are powered by renewable energy from the sun or wind, geothermal energy is not only CO2 neutral but also free from other harmful emissions. The exact location of the facility, as well as specific figures on plant capacity, will be confirmed in the coming months.
The parties are targeting a clarification on these matters by the end of September.
“Hillerød Forsyning already has considerable knowledge about geothermal energy, seismic data is available, and there is a clear ambition on both sides of the table to work quickly together on the technical issues that needs to be clarified before a contract can be signed. We look forward to this collaboration – and hope to contribute to green district heating in Hillerød in a few years,” added Samir Abboud, CEO at Innargi.
Elsewhere in Denmark, Innargi has drilled two wells and has started construction of a heating plant for the geothermal heating project in Aarhus. The initial target for the project is to start to supply heat to the northern part of the city by the end of 2025.

A Federal Patronage Committee assigned to the Haute-Sorne geothermal project in the Canton of Jura in Switzerland has given an overall positive initial impression of the project. The Committee, however, made some recommendations for the project, two of which were concerning improved communications.
Drilling activities at the site of the Haute-Sorne geothermal site started in started in May 2024 and were completed by August. Various tests are still being done on the borehole as the project prepares for a reservoir stimulation program. To ensure that the project complies to good governance principles, a patronage committee composed of independent individuals was assigned by the Swiss federal government.
The Haute-Sorne geothermal project is under development by
The first annual report presented by the Federal Patronage Committee is generally positive. The report also gave three recommendations for the further progress of the project:
* The committee recommends that the company improve the preparation of technical information about the project for a broader audience;
* The Monitoring and Information Commission is recommended to continue direct exchange and dialogue with the public;
* A strategy for monitoring borehole integrity should be developed to protect groundwater quality.
In 2025, the Patronage Committee will continue to monitor the progress of the work and risk management, particularly with regard to seismic risk and impacts on water resources. Particular attention will be paid to the results of the geophysical survey conducted in January 2025 and the stimulation tests planned for spring. The results of this work will be crucial for the further progress of the project.

The geothermal doublets have a combined capacity of 36 MWH and have been in production since February 2019. With the acquisition of the shares of a consortium of greenhouse growers, Ennatuurlijk is now the full owner of these doublets. However, the consortium remains involved as a co-shareholder of the existing heating network. The company name has been changed from ECW Geo Andijk BV to Ennatuurlijk Aardwarmte Andijk BV.
Arnaud van Dijk, director of VD Holland, stated: “Thanks to the acquisition by Ennatuurlijk, we can focus on our core activities and no longer have to concern ourselves with the exploitation of the geothermal doublets. We like to use sustainable and affordable heat, but have experienced that geothermal energy requires a lot of specialist knowledge, time and manpower
With this expansion, Ennatuurlijk now manages six doublets: two in Andijk and four at Agriport in Middenmeer. In addition, Ennatuurlijk is investigating the possibility of developing a third doublet in Andijk, with the aim of increasing the supply of sustainable heat in the future. Ennatuurlijk also manages the only active High Temperature Storage (HTO) in Europe, with which surplus geothermal heat can be stored in the summer for use in the winter.
Alexander van Noort, director of Ennatuurlijk Aardwarmte, added: “The acquisition of the doublets in North Holland is a long-cherished wish of Ennatuurlijk and demonstrates our continued commitment to sustainable heat. This makes it possible to develop a third heat doublet in Andijk in the future

The Icelandic government is ramping up efforts to expand geothermal energy utilization, particularly in cold regions where communities still rely on electricity or oil for heating. This initiative, announced by Minister of the Environment, Energy, and Climate, Jóhann Páll Jóhannsson in a meeting today, is a key step toward enhancing energy security, reducing costs, and maximizing Iceland’s geothermal potential.
Addressing energy gaps in cold regions
Despite Iceland’s reputation as a global leader in geothermal energy, around 10% of households remain disconnected from geothermal district heating. The new exploration program aims to bridge this gap by identifying and developing new geothermal resources in regions where geothermal has been underutilized. We reported on more recent efforts in the Westfjords of Iceland, but also in the East in Höfn.
Economic benefits of geothermal expansion
A recent report commissioned by the Icelandic Ministry of the Environment, Energy, and Climate suggests that enhancing geothermal utilization could generate up to ISK 8 billion (USD 58 million) in annual economic benefits. This would come from:
* Lower heating costs for homes and businesses.
* Reduced reliance on fossil fuels and electricity subsidies.
* Increased energy independence through expanded geothermal district heating.
“By optimizing geothermal utilization, we can strengthen energy security, reduce costs, and enhance environmental sustainability,” said Minister Jóhannsson.
Government and industry collaboration
The initiative has gained strong political and industry support, with remarks at the launch event from Íris Róbertsdóttir, Mayor of Vestmannaeyjar and Vilhjálmur Hilmarsson, Chairman of the Icelandic Climate and Energy Fund
The event w liveasstreamed on the Icelandic government’s website, allowing the public to follow the discussion on expanding Iceland’s geothermal footprint.
A strategic move for Iceland’s energy future
The government’s geothermal push aligns with Iceland’s broader renewable energy goals, which include:
* Expanding district heating in remote areas.
* Investing in new geothermal research and drilling projects.
* Ensuring long-term sustainability and cost efficiency in Iceland’s heating system.
With continued investment in geothermal energy, Iceland is taking concrete steps toward a more resilient, sustainable energy future—one that benefits both local communities and the national economy.

A new funding package in the State of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) in Germany has been announced to support geothermal projects. The funding will subsidize exploration drilling while also hedging the discovery risk for production wells.
The new funding package was announced by Mona Nuebaur, Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Protection, during a visit to the drilling site of a geothermal research well in Krefeld. The drilling in Krefeld started on 19 March 2025 and is estimated to last two months.
This also marks the anniversary of the presentation of the “Geothermal Master Plan NRW,” with which the state has set ambitious expansion goals for geothermal and introduced the first nationwide funding and safeguarding instrument for the implementation of medium- and deep geothermal projects. Nine applications have already been submitted, including eight for project preparatory studies and one for 2D seismic surveys in the Aachen area.
The funding will support geothermal in the following ways:
* Exploratory drilling
* Improved risk coverage
* Expansion of funding program
Applications for the new funding can be submitted starting 8 April 2025. There will also be a webinar on 9 April 2025 on the new funding program organized by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Industry, Climate Protection and Energy with NRW.Energy4Climate and NRW.BANK.
All further information on the application process and answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) can be found
“We are digging the treasure beneath our feet for the sustainable, secure, and affordable heat supply of the future – this is clearly evident here during the geothermal exploration in Krefeld. With our improved funding, we are giving municipalities and utilities the impetus to invest now in secure and affordable heat from the region. This is worthwhile for everyone: for citizens, municipalities, companies – and, of course, for our climate,”

A study conducted by Icelandic partners presents the opportunities to expand geothermal heating in the city of Beius in Bihor County, Romania. The geothermal district heating system of Beius currently supplies 70% of its population, but the local governments seeks to expand this to 100% coverage.
The project “Technical Development of the District Heating System” in Beius was conducted by the National Energy Authority of Iceland together with UAT Beius, with funding from Innovation Norway from the European Economic Area (EEA) and Norwegian grants.
The results of the study was presented recently at meeting attended by the Mayor of Beius, representatives from the
Baldur Petursson from the Icelandic Environment and Energy Agency stated that there was potential for further development of geothermal in Beius to benefit from EEA subsidies. Further, Horia Ban of the Romanian Geoexchange Society presented complementary projects on heat recovery from spent geothermal brine, which can still be extracted and upgraded using heat pumps. This can be used for industrial and agricultural applications, such as greenhouses, wood drying, and fish farming.
Another important conclusion of the study is that heat losses in the district heating system can be minimized by using specialized material, such as pre-insulated PE-Xa pipes.
A geothermal well drilled to a depth of 2600 meters in 1996 tapped a high-flow reservoir with a temperature of 85 °C. This jumpstarted the use of geothermal for heating in Beius, supplying affordable and sustainable heat to apartment blocks, hospitals, nurseries, kindergartens, and other public institutions. A second well was drilled in 2004, and a third in 2010. Today, Beius is the city with the cheapest heating costs in Romania.
While Western Romania already has extensive history in geothermal utilization, the capital of Bucharest has also undertaken studies to evaluate the feasibility of geothermal heating. In 2024, an agreement was signed between the local utility company ELCEN and the US Department of Energy to jointly study the potential for geothermal heating in Bucharest. Another similar agreement was signed later in 2024 for a similar study with Sage Geosystems, in partnership with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

The consultation period has started for FER-T, a Ministerial Decree in Italy that aims for an incentive mechanism for renewable heating, including geothermal.

As announced by the
The FER-T decree supports the production of thermal energy from renewable sources for plants with thermal power generation capacity of more than 2 MWth. There are four thermal energy sources considered under FER-T:
* Geothermal energy
* Solar thermal energy
* Bioenergy
* Environmental energy
New, upgraded, or renovated systems are eligible to receive these incentives.
“The competitive incentive mechanism, complementary to the Thermal Account, aims to increase the production of large-scale plants and achieve the national decarbonisation objectives for 2030 outlined in the PNIEC,”
The FER-T represents a much-needed follow up to the FER 2 decree, approved in late 2024, which sets tariffs for electricity produced from geothermal energy sources. It also addresses some of the criticisms from the geothermal sector regarding the FER 2 and the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan (PNIEC), which did not highlight the potential role of geothermal for the heating and cooling sector.
During the recently concluded Italian Geothermal Forum, many representatives stated the importance of strategy and vision for starting a resurgence of geothermal growth in Italy.

Pending several legal and environmental decisions, the geothermal heating plant in Konin, Poland aims to start operations by April 2025.

Heating supply from the newly built geothermal heating plant in Konin, Poland has been stalled by several legal proceedings. However, the President of
In October 2024, MPEC Konin announced the completion of construction of the 8.1-MWth geothermal heating plant in Konin. The construction was supported by funding from the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management (NFOSiGW). Of the PLN 67 million total investment for the project, PLN 26 million in funding and another loan of PLN 18 million came from the NFOSiGW. The local government then contributed PLN 4 million. The rest of the money from MPEC Konin.
To start with the operations of the heating plant, the heating company is still waiting on two documents – the environmental decision for exploitation of the geothermal resource from the Regional Directorate for Environmental Protection in Poznan, as well as the concession for heat generation from the Energy Regulatory Office.
MPEC Konin had also submitted documents for the procedures for new heat tariffs, although the above-mentioned decisions will still be needed to supplement the application. In any case, the share of the new geothermal heating plant is not expected to have a new impact on the tariffs. Geothermal will account for only 5-10% of the heat supply in Konin, with the rest coming from biomass and waste incineration.
The company president states that some of the documents can only be completed once construction has finished. “This is an administrative procedure lasting several months, conditioned by certain deadlines. We are trying to work on certain documents in parallel, but we will not change the procedure. We really want this heating plant to produce heat already, because it is ready to operate,”

The OECS and IRENA have entered into a partnership for stakeholder engagement and community involvement for geothermal in Eastern Caribbean states.
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
The
The initiative will particularly focus on Dominica, Grenada, St Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and St Vincent and the Grenadines.
The project will be executed as part of the OECS Commission’s Geothermal Energy: Capacity Building for Utilisation, Investment and Local Development (GEOBUILD) Programme. The GEOBUILD programme is funded by the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) with finance from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the European Union Caribbean Investment Facility (EU-CIF) through CDB’s GeoSmart Initiative. The programme seeks to harness the region’s geothermal potential to provide sustainable energy solutions, reduce dependence on fossil fuels, and promote economic resilience.
“The partnership with IRENA represents a pivotal step forward in our efforts to develop geothermal energy in the OECS. By fostering a robust stakeholder engagement, we can ensure that the voices of our communities are heard and that their needs are integrated into our energy strategies,”
#### Improving geothermal stakeholder engagement
By working closely with IRENA, the OECS Commission aims to engage local communities, government officials, and private stakeholders about the benefits and opportunities associated with geothermal energy development which could transform economies and heighten energy independence and security in the OECS.
In late 2023, the GEOBUILD programme held a workshop in Grenada to provide training in communicating about geothermal energy, with emphasis on how geothermal can be used for direct applications that can create economic and social opportunities for member states.
The programme also held a study tour for representatives from Eastern Caribbean countries to the ongoing geothermal project in Dominica. Building on the success of Guadeloupe, which has been generating geothermal power since 1986 and is expanding its capacity, Dominica is set to make history as the first geothermal power station in the English-speaking OECS and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) by late 2025.

#### Promoting inclusive community involvement
IRENA’s involvement will provide technical expertise and best practices to support the OECS in fostering effective stakeholder engagement, ensuring diverse perspectives are integrated into decision-making processes. This partnership reflects IRENA’s commitment to supporting Small Island Developing States in their transition to renewable energy sources and facilitating inclusive dialogues that drive sustainable development.
“By harnessing the power of collaboration, we aim to ensure local priorities are at the heart of these efforts, building capacity, strengthening resilience, and delivering sustainable energy solutions that secure a more sustainable and prosperous future for OECS Member States,”
The project fosters inclusive community involvement, empowering local villages near geothermal sites to actively engage in decision-making processes and voice their concerns. Additionally, it focuses on capacity building by equipping stakeholders with essential knowledge and skills. This approach not only builds local expertise but also ensures that communities are prepared to lead and sustain their energy transitions.
Harnessing geothermal resources can provide benefits both economically and environmentally. Not only does it provide a clean and renewable energy source with vastly reduced greenhouse gas emissions, but it provides jobs and stimulates economics by supplying energy at lower costs for consumers. These benefits position the OECS member states to advance sustainable energy development while enhancing economic stability and environmental sustainability.

In a release last week, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management announced having approved the Newcastle Geothermal Development project. The 20 MW project is located on public land managed by the BLM near Newcastle in Iron County, Utah.
With the approval, the developer Utah Geothermal Energy Partners is authorized to construct a geothermal power plant, substation, buried powerlines, access roads, two well pads, and up to seven geothermal wells. The total surface area for these modifications is expected to be about 13.9 acres.
By approving projects like this, BLM continues to support President Trump’s national emergency declaration by tackling the critical need for a reliable, diversified, growing and affordable supply of energy.

For those who are interested, please follow the link to the corresponding opening:
The URBAN-GeoHeatdistrict heating for residential developments in Dublin.
The project will carry out intensive monitoring of a residential development incorporating shallow (<25m) foundation piles. A small-scale prototype involving geothermal loops will also be installed within a number of these foundation piles which will be connected to a prototype geothermal heating system. The goal of this prototype is not to test implementation of district heating at scale but to test and demonstrate a working prototype in real world conditions to investigate feasibility for construction and operation of such a systems. It will also serve as a flagship demonstration of how district heating linked to geostructures can be incorporated into design in new developments in Dublin going forward.
The collected data will be used to assess temporal variations in performance against changing climatic and energy demand profiles and to develop numerical models of each system in terms of heat transfer and groundwater flow. These calibrated models will be then used to evaluate potential optimised system configurations to gain more heat from the same footprint. Overall, the results of this study should help to stimulate the somewhat nascent concept of district heating as a realistic future approach to more sustainable energy management in urban areas of Ireland.
Trinity is Ireland’s leading university and is ranked 87th in the world (QS World University Rankings 2025). Founded in 1592, the University is steeped in history with a reputation for excellence in education, research, and innovation, which has been inspiring generations of thinkers for over 400 years.

Newly elected Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has submitted a series of energy reform initiatives to the Joint Committee on Energy and Legislative Studies of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. Seeking to strengthen the country’s energy and electricity sector, the proposal seeks to introduce new laws and amend laws including those on geothermal, biofuels, the hydrocarbon sector, and the National Energy Commission.
The official letter issued by the Federal Executive Branch has been published in
#### Simplifying geothermal regulation
The new Geothermal Law seeks to update the regulatory framework for the use of the Mexico’s geothermal resources. It also aims to simplify regulation, particularly as pertaining to the registry of projects and the issuance of exploration permits. The law also recognized the divers uses of geothermal resources in urban heating, drying of agricultural and industrial products, aquaculture, and food preservation.
Among the provisions of the Geothermal Law are the definition of geothermal resources, the process for application for a geothermal exploration permit, the terms of said permit, the process of granting concession rights, and reporting requirements for permit holders. The law introduces a “Various Uses” permit that pertain to the use of geothermal for applications other than electricity generation.
Restructuring of agencies
Part of the energy reform proposal is an integrated structure for the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) and Petroloes Mexicanos (PEMEX). It also eliminates the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) and the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH), transferring their functions instead to the Ministry of Energy. These changes aim to improve regulatory efficiency and strengthening energy planning.
The CFE has played the leading role in geothermal development in Mexico, developing and operating the geothermal power facilities of Cerro Prieto, Los Azufres, and Los Humeros.

![](
![](
The
The 2024 activity report, published on MTA’s website, provides insights into the institution’s operations, covering a wide range of topics, from tenders to exploration activities. Here are some key highlights in the field of geothermal energy:
#### 103 Geothermal Fields Transferred to Investors
According to the report, a total of 103 geothermal fields have been transferred to investors through tenders conducted under Geothermal Law No. 5686 and its Implementation Regulation. It is stated that 16 of these fields are suitable for electricity generation.
#### Ongoing Geothermal Exploration in Central Anatolia
As part of ongoing studies in Central Anatolia, research focuses on the stratigraphic structure, geological formations, fault and fracture systems, and regional stress structure. In the Giresun-?ebinkarahisar field, geological surveys and geophysical studies have been completed. Detailed geological and geophysical studies continue in the licensed areas of Kayseri and K?rsehir, while geothermal drilling in Nevsehir and geological surveys in Cankiri are contributing to the assessment of the region’s potential.
#### Geothermal Energy Potential in Western Anatolia
Western Anatolia, one of Türkiye’s most geothermal-rich regions, is under investigation, particularly in the Kücük Menderes Graben, for potential electricity generation and heating applications. Geological and geophysical studies have been completed in licensed areas in Izmir-Bayindir, Aliaga, Menemen, and Bergama, while some drilling activities in Balikesir were terminated due to low temperature.
#### Ongoing Exploration in the Black Sea and Eastern Anatolia
In the Western Black Sea region, geological and geophysical studies have been conducted in Bolu and Düzce. In Eastern Anatolia, exploration continues in Agri, Artvin, Bingöl, Erzurum, Igd?r, and Van. A geothermal drilling well in Agri was closed due to high reservoir pressure, and new studies are being planned in the region. In Southeastern Anatolia, geothermal field analyses and drilling operations are ongoing in Diyarbakir, Siirt, Bingöl, and Sanliurfa.
#### Geothermal Licenses and New Developments
MTA applies for Geothermal Resource Exploration Licenses from Provincial Special Administrations and Governorships under the Geothermal Resources and Natural Mineral Waters Law No. 5686. If geothermal resources are identified in the licensed areas, these fields are either tendered under the State Tender Law No. 2886 or transferred to public institutions and organizations through approval by the Ministry based on revenue-sharing principles or compensation.
As of the end of 2024, the geothermal license statistics are:
* 51 total geothermal licenses
* 17 new geothermal licenses granted
* 18 geothermal licenses abandoned
* 1 geothermal license transferred through tender
#### Türkiye’s Geothermal Map is Being Updated
Since 1963, MTA has conducted geothermal energy exploration and is now digitizing all data to create a Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based data management system. Under Law No. 5686, all geothermal drillings conducted by the private and public sectors will be integrated into a GIS-based database. This initiative will produce a detailed geothermal resource map of Türkiye, making it accessible to researchers and the public.
According to MTA’s activity report, ongoing geothermal studies will contribute to Türkiye’s renewable energy utilization and enhance energy independence. Future efforts will focus on identifying new geothermal sites and advancing work in existing fields.

Interest from potential partners from the public and private sectors is growing for the use of geothermal for district heating and other commercial applications in the town of Kutina in the Sisak-Moslavina County in Croatia. With this in mind, well testing and hydrodynamic measurements are set to begin for the existing Batina-1 well, located less than 3 kilometers from the potential users of geothermal heat.
The Kutina exploration area is located within the Pannonian Basin. The geothermal potential of the area has been well-documented by historical research, with key geological insights provided by oil and gas exploration wells in the region.
Preliminary investigations have already indicated good potential at the Batina-1 well, but further testing is needed to quantify this potential. The well is particularly interesting as it taps into a potential aquifer within the Kutina Sandstones.
To prepare for the well testing program, technical documentation to apply for a permit was headed by the local government with Icelandic partners EFLA hf and the Development Agency MRAV.
Croatia currently has one operational geothermal power in Velika Ciglena, which officially opened in 2018. Interest for further geothermal development in Croatia has been sustained since then, with multiple wells currently being drilled or in the process of planning and preparation.

Registration:
Multi-stage, multi-well completions cause pore-pressures to increase around each stage treated, compound from earlier offset treatment stages, then dissipate as the injected fluid leaks off into the rock formation. Local stress changes illuminated by microseismic focal mechanisms can be used to create maps of high and low stresses which, in turn, can be used to guide a dynamic slurry propagation model and estimate fluid and proppant distribution from the injection. Injected slurry volumes respond to these stress changes which are dependent upon lag time from previously treated stages.
Case studies are presented to demonstrate these time-dependent changes which influence the modeled induced fractures from the stimulation. A geothermal example is presented from Nevada where microseismic events align with local faulting during pumping and increase in intensity during plant shutdown. Focal mechanisms of discrete events are inverted to solve the local stress state

![](
French geothermal gropu Arverne (Euronext Paris: ARVEN), reports having launched a research project to test an innovative surface geothermal technology. The initiative is part of the “Sustainable Energy” research program led by French energy transition agency ADEME and executed through Arverne Group’s subsidiary, DrillHeat.
Coordinated by BRGM and supported by the French Association of Geothermal Professionals (AFPG), the project aims to improve the installation techniques of geothermal probes, focusing on enhancing cementation quality. A key component is the use of high-resistance cementation socks, a new product developed by French geotextile manufacturer CHAB. The tests will take place at BRGM’s geothermal platform in Orléans under real-world conditions.
Arverne Group has launched two test campaigns, with BRGM collecting and analyzing cementation data to assess performance.
Pierre Brossollet, founder and CEO of Arverne Group, highlighted the importance of the project: “We are excited to drive this research and development effort to advance industry practices. The expected benefits include reducing material use for environmental gains and improving efficiency for workers. Expanding surface geothermal energy is crucial for decarbonizing buildings and diversifying France’s energy mix.”
Arverne Group was founded in 2018 and is headquartered in Pau, France. The company specializes in transforming underground resources into sustainable energy solutions. With operations spanning exploration, drilling, and energy production, the company aims to lead the French geothermal market, including low-carbon geothermal lithium.

The CRMA establishes clear targets for increasing domestic capacities within the strategic raw material supply chain, while improving access to funding, and ensuring adherence to the highest social and environmental standards. “Strategic projects” identified under the CRMA are those that are deemed to have the the potential to help increase European Union (EU) capacity to extract, process and recycle strategic raw materials and diversify EU supplies from third countries.
Vulcan Energy has received the distinction for their Phase One Lionheart Project, located in the Upper Rhine Valley region bordering Germany and France. The project aims to harness geothermal heat and produce lithium from geothermal brine using their in-house VULSORB sorbent.
“Achieving Strategic Project status from the European Commission validates the importance of our integrated lithium and renewable energy project to European industry, and builds momentum for the delivery of Europe’s first fully domestic and sustainable lithium value chain,”
“The CRMA plays a pivotal role in driving change and highlighting the importance of sustainable raw material extraction in Europe. With access to Europe’s largest lithium resource, our Project is strategically positioned to support the CRMA benchmarks and diversify the EU’s lithium supply away from third countries.”
The Alsace Géothermie Lithium (Ageli) of Eramet and ES aims to harness the geothermal waters of the Rhine Graben in Northern Alsace, France to produce decarbonated energy and the lithium needed for Europe’s future battery industry. To achieve this, Eramet has adapted its patented process for direct extraction of battery-grade lithium, one of the most responsible in the world, which is already operational on the Centenario site in Argentina. A pilot project had been inaugurated at the Rittershoffen geothermal heat plant in 2023.
“We are delighted that the European Commission considers Ageli to be a “strategic project” capable of making a lasting contribution to the European Union’s security of supply. We hope that this label will act as a lever for the development of this ambitious project, and that it will result in political and financial support commensurate with the technological, economic and strategic challenges to overcome,”
“The European Commission’s recognition marks an important step forward for the Ageli project. It encourages us in our ambition to develop, with our partner Eramet, one of the most responsible lithium production projects in the world, with a positive impact on the region. Our teams are committed to providing Alsace with our expertise in the development of high-temperature geothermal projects and our experience in operating two geothermal plants for almost 10 years,”
The European Commission received 170 applications from companies seeking Strategic Project status, with assessment undertaken by external experts selected by the European Commission. Applications were assessed by at least four individual experts whose collective expertise covers technical, financial, and ESG-related aspects, as well as the United Nations Framework Classification for Resources.

The municipality of Grünwald in Bavaria, Germany and local utility Constructed over the last 18 months, the new pipeline connects the two geothermal production sites of Laufzorn and Unterhaching.
The new district heating pipeline is part of the effort to expand the geothermal district heating network in Grünwald – a project that was first announced back in 2022. Aside from an expansion of the heating network, this project will also involve the drilling of new wells for two doublets, as well as the construction of a new heating plant. Federal funding for the project had also been announced earlier this year.
In his speech during the inauguration ceremony, Mayor Jan Neusiedl recalled the history of geothermal in Grünwald: “In 2008, when there was no public discussion about renewable heat, the municipality of Grünwald decided to invest in geothermal energy. A total of 1,500 connections were originally planned, but there are currently 2,042, and the number is rising.”
“We were quick to and consistently relied on the great potential of geothermal energy and more than 15 years later, we are more committed than ever to continuing to replace fossil fuels and promote green energy supplies. Geothermal energy is the best solution for the energy transition. It provides a safe supply of valuable energy, is completely CO2-free, works in all weather conditions, and is barely visible.”
Drilling of the new wells is expected to be done by 2026 and will be followed by the construction of surface facilities. The expanded geothermal district heating network is expected to be operational for the 2027 to 2028 heating season.

The partnership will focus on the existing 2-MW Waita No. 1 Geothermal Power Plant, which has been operating since 2015 in the Kumamoto Prefecture, and the 5-MW Waita No. 2 Geothermal Power Plant, which has been under construction since early 2024.
By combining Furusato’s 10 years of practical experience in the construction and operation of geothermal power plants, and TGES’s knowledge of optimal heat use and plant construction, the partnership strives to improve the competitiveness of geothermal energy. The two companies would also like to expand the Waita area’s community-based geothermal power business model nationwide.
The “Waita Model” is founded on the leading role that local residents take in the construction and operation of the geothermal power plant. The revenues from the sale of electricity generated are then used to support initiatives that revitalize the local community. The model has been proven to be a great example of how geothermal power facilities can operate side-by-side with local onsen operations.

Environmentally friendly and sustainable practices in geothermal energy are becoming increasingly important. In this context, our Turkish platform
### Can you provide information on the current status of geothermal NCG re-injection efforts in Türkiye?
In recent years, geothermal NCG re-injection efforts in Türkiye have gained significant momentum. Particularly in geothermal fields where power plants are prevalent, such as in Aydin and Denizli, numerous projects are being conducted focusing on the re-injection of harmful gases like CO2 and H2S. These efforts aim to reduce the environmental impact of geothermal power plants and increase public acceptance. Leading companies are developing solutions tailored to the field’s production conditions, ensuring the re-injection of NCG into reservoirs and optimizing this process.
NCG mainly consists of greenhouse gases such as CO2, H2S, and hydrocarbons, which are released into the atmosphere during production. Emissions from geothermal power plants may pose a risk of facing carbon taxes in the future. In recent years, numerous proposals and studies have been conducted on re-injecting NCG into geothermal reservoirs.
### How did you initiate your studies on NCG re-injection, and what are the most significant findings you have obtained?
Our studies on re-injecting NCG into geothermal reservoirs began with a TUBITAK research project we launched in 2013. Through this study, we discovered that CO2 and H2S dissolve very easily in water. The solubility of gases in water increases as the temperature decreases. Thus, more NCG can dissolve in re-injected water at lower temperatures. Another factor affecting solubility is pressure. In short, as pressure increases and temperature decreases, more NCG can dissolve in water. Mege A? supported our research project, and the data from the Dora-II geothermal power plant were used in this project.
![]( 2 GPP (source: Ormat)
If the NCG pressure under operating conditions is below the re-injection pressure, it can be increased using a compressor to reach the required solubility pressure. In some cases, the NCG pressure may naturally be higher than the re-injection pressure, making it possible to inject NCG without needing a compressor.
In conclusion, it is possible to re-inject all NCG back into the reservoir. However, using compressors can significantly increase internal energy consumption. Therefore, the incentive mechanisms in geothermal energy should be revised, and zero-emission geothermal power plants should be rewarded.
### We also spoke with Kutlu Cakir, General Manager of Mege Geothermal A.S., about the NCG re-injection processes’ field applications and outcomes.
### Mr. Kutlu, could you tell us about your field applications and the results of the NCG re-injection processes at Mege Geothermal AS?
Velika GPP, is the world’s first geothermal power plant to generate electricity by converting old oil wells into production wells.
Mege AS was the first in Türkiye to start NCG re-injection without compressors. We are pleased that this practice has recently become widespread in other fields. Mege A? has an installed capacity of 80 MW with five Binary geothermal power plants in the Aydin Salavatli geothermal field.
The first geothermal power plant on the site, Dora-I, was commissioned in 2006 with a capacity of 7.95 MW. Although the highest temperature in the field is 213°C, the production wells of the power plants have an average production temperature of 160-180°C. Initially, the NCG content of the produced fluid was 1.5% by mass, but it has gradually decreased to an average of 0.5%. The reduced amount of NCG has made re-injection easier.
### What are your future goals?
The NCG re-injection efforts at Mege Geothermal AS have yielded positive results. All NCG is re-injected into the reservoir at Dora-I, Dora-II, and Dora-IIIA units. The NCG collected from emission points at 7-8 bar pressure is connected to the re-injection line using stainless steel pipes. Since the re-injection wells operate at low pressure, all NCG is re-injected into the reservoir with the water.
The application has been ongoing for over a year at Dora-II and Dora-IIIA units, and TÜBITAK has certified the absence of NCG emissions based on on-site measurements. At Dora-I, NCG re-injection has been ongoing for a few months. We have also started a new project to re-inject approximately half of the NCG into Dora-IIIB. We aim to achieve 100% NCG re-injection across all our geothermal power plants.

# Xiong’An New Area, China records steady growth of geothermal heating
!Xiong’An New Area, China records steady growth of geothermal heating Government of Xiong'an New Area, Xiong'an, Hebei, China (source:

Eight years after its establishment, the Xiong'an New Area in Hebei,China has developed geothermal heating covering 12 million square meters of floor area.

The geothermal heating capacity in the Xiong’An New Area in Hebei, China has now grown to 12 million square meters on the 8th year anniversary of its establishment. This corresponds to about 27% of the floor area of the newly constructed zones in Xiong’An, and this number is expected to increase to 30% by next year.
Assuming an average household size of 42 square meters, this means that geothermal is providing heating to about 285,000 households in the Xiong’An New Area.
We had reported on the early years of development of the Xiong’An New Area back in 2019.
#### Strict regulations for sustainability
The geothermal resources in Xiong’An had already been documented in the 1970s during drilling for oil exploitation, as explained by Hu Wenjin, deputy general manager of China Xiongan Group Smart Energy Co. The resources were then quickly utilized for hot springs baths and heating. However, the lack of any regulation at the time meant that excessive exploitation resulted in the decline of the geothermal resources and ground subsidence.
Hu explained that, once the New Area was established eight years ago, a strict principle was implemented – the amount of geothermal water to be extracted is determined by the volume that is reinjected, thus ensuring a balance between production and reinjection. Xiong’An New Area has managed to achieve sustainable extraction of geothermal energy and avoided the issues that happened in the past.
#### A hybrid system
Since the New Area’s establishment eight years ago, 60 medium-depth wells and 2360 shallow have been drilled and put into operation. These supply a dozen energy stations have been established in Xiong’An.
Hu further explained that these stations use both geothermal heat and natural gas in a hybrid system. In cases of extreme cold weather, natural gas can be used to supplement geothermal and ensure a stable heat supply. When there is surplus geothermal heat, then the energy stations operate emissions-free. Xiong’An has also started operations of a waste-to-energy facility for added heat supply.
Hu also noted that shallow geothermal energy is a key focus area for development, as these can also provide cooling. “It can not only utilize heat under the ground for winter heating, but also harness the soil’s cooling capacity for summer cooling. It’s an excellent renewable and sustainable energy solution,”

Dutch geothermal heating consortium Aardwarmte Rijnland will be negotiating with new potential partners as Shell reduces its role in the geothermal sector.
![](

![](
![](
![](
![](
In 2021, D4 and Shell announced plans of co-developing at least 200 Mw of geothermal energy projects in the Rhineland area in North Holland. Studies done in the Rijnland geothermal permit area indicates that there is sufficient geothermal energy for the heat demand of 52,000 households and companies in the region. The consortium expects the first geothermal project to be operational by 2028.
In response to questions, a spokesperson from Shell stated, “Although we expect that geothermal energy can play an important role in the Dutch heat transition in the long term, Shell currently sees insufficient prospects to scale up its geothermal activities.”
“We will therefore be talking to our partners in the various projects in the coming period to ensure a smooth transition. We will look for suitable solutions for the individual projects and permits.”
“Shell is therefore pleased with the many years of good cooperation in the field of geothermal energy, with project partners, governments and other stakeholders. Shell remains committed to supplying the energy of today and tomorrow, with more value against less emissions. We are constantly adapting our portfolio to this,”
Aside from the Rijnland project, Shell is also involved in geothermal heating projects in Delft, Leeuwarden, Rotterdam, and Westland. There is no news yet on how Shell’s business decision will affect these ongoing projects.
For the part of Aardwarmte Rijnland, the consortium is determined to continue the feasibility study being carried out with the Bollenstreek municipalities and housing corporation Stek and Sint Antonius van Padua. The study, expected to be completed by Spring 2025, will indicate if it indeed feasible to develop geothermal heating in the region.

Speaking at the 2024 EGS Symposium in Jakarta, Director General of New Renewable Energy (EBTKE) of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) Eniya Listiani Dewi stated that the Indonesian Government is undertaking efforts to reduce the permit processing time for geothermal projects from 18 months to just 5 days.
Eniya explained that this change will be made possible by using the Online Single Submission (OSS) facility for permit application, as well as by reducing the requirements for permits at the beginning for the Suitability of Spatial Utilization Activities (KKPR), as well as permits for Environmental Impact Analysis (AMDAL).
The basis for the changes in permitting requirements had previously been discussed as part of the Regulation of the Minister of Environment and Forestry and Government Regulation Number 5 of 2021, concerning the Implementation of Risk-Based Business Licensing.
Eniya said that the Ministry expects the effects of these changes to be felt within a few months.
Shortening the permitting time is just one of many measures that the MEMR is taking to encourage geothermal development and investment in Indonesia. During COP29 in Baku, the MEMR announced a list of 12 geothermal power projects in Indonesia that were open for investment.

Geothermal drilling is set to begin in the town of Konskie in the Swietokrzyskie Voivodeship of Poland. The drilling rig will be set up before summer, and the well is expected to be completed by the end of the year, thus providing information on the possibility of geothermal energy utilization.
Konskie was one of the communes selected to receive funding for geothermal exploration under the
The geothermal well will be drilled to a target depth of 2500 meters. To be deemed commercially viable, the well has to produce hot water at a flowrate of at least 5 cubic meters per hour and a minimum temperature of 55 °C. If these conditions are met, then the exploration well will be converted to a production well, and the construction of the transmission line and heat exchanger will commence. The drilling site is located only around 200 meters from the municipal heating plant.
While the aim of the project is to stabilize heating costs in Konskie, other commercialization options such as balneological or cosmetic options are also being considered. Should this be worth exploring, the commune will look for commercial partners.

# Steam Srl’s studies lay foundation for Comoros geothermal roadmap
!Steam Srl’s studies lay foundation for Comoros geothermal roadmap Palm trees in Grande Comore island, Comoros (source:
![ ](
![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 10 Feb 2025
Like many island nations, the Comoros seeks to build a sustainable and energy secure future around geothermal with a first project planned in Karthala.
![](

![](
![](
In late 2023 and again in the summer of 2024,
STEAM’s work confirmed the viability of the potential geothermal resource and then further confirmed the presence of sufficient groundwater near the drilling site to support both deep exploration activities and serve the island as a secure water source for the future. The project findings are expected to help unlock new investment for the Mount Karthala project, which has been in development since 2008.
#### Geothermal development in island nations: A strategic advantage
The Mount Karthala project is a significant development in the context of geothermal energy for island nations. Islands like the Comoros face unique energy challenges due to their reliance on imported fuels, which makes energy both expensive and vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. Geothermal energy offers a sustainable, locally sourced alternative that enhances both energy security and economic stability.
For the Comoros, developing its local geothermal energy resources could be transformative. Located in the Mozambique Channel, the country relies heavily on diesel generators and biomass for electricity and heating. With its volcanic activity, particularly around Mount Karthala, the Comoros holds significant untapped geothermal potential. The successful identification of groundwater resources as a drilling aid brings the country one step closer to realizing this potential, aligning with broader global goals of the energy transition such as the UN SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and reducing carbon footprints.
#### The history of geothermal in the Comoros
The Comoros islands began their geothermal journey in 2008, when experts from Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) carried out geoscientific studies that confirmed the area’s geothermal potential. Six years later, the Bureau Géologique des Comores (BGC) conducted studies with the support of several consultants and service providers. The results indicated that the area has the potential to generate more than 45 MW of geothermal power.
Following the study, the Comoros secured commitments from Geothermal Risk Mitigation Facility (GRMF), the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and other donors and financiers to proceed with the exploratory drilling, paving the way for a financial close thanks to a business plan that outlined a clear path to profitability.
![]( sampling in Comoros (source: Bureau Géologique des Comore)
One of the greatest hurdles to making a convincing argument that the Mount Karthala project is viable rests in the ability to support exploratory drilling using ground water, with expected expected water supply needs of 3,000 liters per minute for 60 days. Although the Grande Comore Island is characterized by abundant rainfall of between 1,500 and 2,000mm/year, up to 4,000 mm/year in the Mount Karthala area, the infiltration rate is estimated around 95%, meaning much of the precipitation flows into the underground and not into the sea.
However, most of the country’s wells are near the shore, making it unfeasible to pipe water up to the drilling area. Consequently, it was necessary to investigate the hydrogeological setting of the inner zones of the volcanic units of Mount Karthala to provide the necessary water supply.
#### De-risking the reservoir model and the hydrological model
STEAM’s involvement in the Comoros project, together with its partner GEL Energy, was divided into two strategic phases. In the first phase, working in collaboration with UNDP Comoros and local stakeholders, STEAM’s team reviewed the existing resource assessments and project plan, and then developed a detailed roadmap for moving the project forward to the exploratory phase. In this phase, STEAM collaborated with United Downs geothermal project implemented in Cornwall (UK).
In the second phase, STEAM geologist Lorenzo Favaro worked with Viridien Group and Phoenix Geophysics to execute a two-week capacity building agenda and hydrogeological study. This phase confirmed the validity and integrity of the field testing instruments through a class and field training exercises for the BGC team.
Once adept in the use of the instruments, the project team executed an integrated magneto-telluric (MT) survey, which comprised an expanded field of 24 MT additional sites, extending the 3D resistivity model towards the northern area of the island. The expanded testing area aimed to expand the original model built by BGC in 2015, shifting the focus to the shallower layers on the northern side of the volcano in order to confirm the feasibility of shallow water wells, between 250 and 300m, foreseen in earlier studies.
The results of Phase 2 confirmed that it is reasonable to expect a water table depth of approximately 230-300 m g.l. in accordance with the original projections, though it also indicated that some wells would need to go deeper.

#### Expert insight from STEAM’s Senior Geologist
Lorenzo Favaro, STEAM’s Senior Geologist and lead for the project, emphasized the importance of a comprehensive approach in geothermal project development: “Acquiring new data in tropical forests and inaccessible areas was a unique and trying experience, with many hours of walking, even at night. But all data—geological, logistical, and environmental—contribute to de-risking a geothermal project.”
“A multidisciplinary company like STEAM, with our long and diverse experience, has the capability to work with all project stakeholders to build the complete datasets required to move past the surface exploration phase. Without this step, the deep exploration and subsequent design and construction phases of a geothermal plant are futile.”

Shoji Numata, President of Machiokoshi Energy, provides some insights on the trend of developing small-scale geothermal power facilities in Japan.

In an interview published by Nikkei Business Publications, Shoji Numata, President of renewable power developer
A country update published by the most of these power plants are considered small, with capacities ranging from 20 to 250 kW.
Machiokoshi Energy is seemingly following this trend with the construction of the 5-MW Oguni geothermal power plant in the town of Oguni in the Kumamoto Prefecture. The company is unique in that it was founded by Shoji Numata, a supermarket mogul who envisions bringing a “franchise” model to the geothermal business. Aside from focusing on small-scale development, Machiokoshi packages the geothermal projects as vehicles for multipurpose community economic revitalization. This means that the projects can provide opportunities beyond power production.
#### Small projects shorten the development time
Commenting on the trend of small-scale geothermal power development, Numata explained that the strategy significantly shortens the development time of geothermal power projects. “Most existing geothermal power plants take more than 15 years to start operation. For private companies, dedicating personnel for such a long period of time before operation is a huge burden,”
The fact that many sites are located within national parks and potentially coincide with operations of the hot spring industry also adds another layer of complexity to developing geothermal projects.
For the Oguni geothermal power project, the decision to limit the size to 5-MW significantly simplified the process. Instead of custom-made designs for the power plant, the company relied on a basic design that can be manufactured and deployed quickly.
Numata further explains that environmental assessment of projects with a planned output of 7.5 MWe or more can take between 2 to 4 years. It can then take an additional 2 years for the design and manufacture of power plant equipment. This adds on to the approximately 10 years it takes to explore and evaluate the surface and subsurface characteristics of a potential project site.
However, Numata remains steadfast in support of geothermal in Japan. “Japan is not blessed with fossil fuel resources, but it is said to have the third highest potential in the world when it comes to geothermal energy. It is a stable source of power that we can be proud of.”
“As a Japanese company involved in renewable energy, we wonder what we are doing if we don’t get serious about geothermal power.”
#### “If it doesn’t exist, make it yourself”
Numata draws on his experience in the manufacturing and retail industry to carry the “making what does not exist” philosophy to geothermal. An example of this is the small, crawler-type drilling rig and mobile steam separator that the company designed in-house. This allows for drilling of geothermal boreholes up to 1 kilometer deep, even when there are no roads leading to the project sites.
This type of innovation not only shortened project development time, but also reduced costs significantly. “With the conventional tower method, the excavation cost for one hole would run into the hundreds of millions of yen, but with this method it only cost a few tens of millions of yen,”
Numata also established Geopower Academy, a vocation school for drilling in Hokkaido. The institution aims to bridge the competency gap left by the lack of institutional support for geothermal in Japan in the 1990s.

A recent Parliamentary hearing in Italy convened experts and stakeholders to discuss recent legislative changes that seek to boost geothermal sector growth.

Editor’s note: Special thanks to
On October 8, 2024, one of Italy’s leading political parties, “Energy Independence: Geothermal’s Contribution” (“Indipendenza energetica: il Contributo della Geotermia”).
Following the recent release of the Piano Nazionale Integrato per l’Energia e il ClimaEuropean Commission’s approval in August 2024 of Italy’s FER2 decree (roughly translated, “Renewable Energy Sources”), the hearing was surprisingly not framed as simply “Next Steps for Geothermal”.
Instead, the event convened the country’s most influential and relevant experts regarding the geothermal industry, giving them a platform to voice both their concerns regarding the efficacy of PNIEC and FER2 to fully support the realization of Italy’s geothermal industry as well as to provide the government with a clearer picture of the current opportunities and national potential of Italy’s geothermal sector.
The importance of the event was confirmed by the participation of the honorable Gilberto Pichetto Fratin—Italy’s Minister of the Environment and Energy Security, who called geothermal an “integral” part of the country’s energy transition—as well as by the live streaming the hearing on
While the proceedings were not an officially recognized Parliamentary session and thus were not relevant from a legal standpoint, the event signals that Italy’s national government may be moving to address wider industry concerns that PNIEC and FER2 need additional support to realize the country’s geothermal potential.

#### Background: FER2’s Incentives for Geothermal Energy
In the coming months, Italy’s GSE (“Gestore dei Servizi Energetici”) will open the first selection round for renewable energy projects covered by FER 2. For geothermal projects, only two types are identified:
* **“Traditional geothermal with innovations”** , referring to the optimization and/or refurbishment of existing plants, or new plants; and
* **“Geothermal with zero emissions”** , referring to plants that fully reinject all naturally occurring fluids and gases back into the same geothermal reservoir.
In both cases, FER 2 provides caps for the total combined capacity among all authorized projects:
* 100 MWe for “Traditional geothermal with innovations”, which are eligible for incentive tariffs of 100 €/MWh over a 25-year lifespan, and
* 60 MWe for “Geothermal with zero emissions”, which are eligible for incentive tariffs of 200 €/MWh over a 25-year lifespan
By comparison, the cap for Offshore wind is 3,800 MW and includes an incentive tariff of 185 €/MWh while the cap for Offshore floating photovoltaics is 200 MW and includes an incentive tariff of 100 €/MWh over a 20-year lifespan.
Payment will be managed through Contracts of Difference (CfD), where GSE will pay plant owners the difference between the tariff due and the market price of the energy. Where this difference is positive, the GSE pays the incentives by applying a premium tariff to the net production injected into the grid. Where the difference is negative, the GSE requests the corresponding amount from the producer.
In order to apply for the tariff, however, developers must have already obtained an authorization for the construction and operation of the plant, or an authorized EIA for the geothermal project, as well as an approved grid connection estimate.
Developers must also abide by the stated timeframes for project implementation in order to obtain the tariff incentive: for “Traditional geothermal with innovations”, new plants must be operational within 51 months and refurbished plants within 36 months and “Zero-emissions geothermal plants” must be operational within 5 years.

#### FER 2: Limitations and Potential Roadblocks
While Italy’s PNIEC
“Despite glowing conclusions from public-private consultations like that of Ambrosetti’s spring 2024 report on geothermal’s potential in accelerating the energy transition in Italy, the FER 2 legislation—which was written by the Italian government—is widely seen as having failed to achieve the necessary frameworks needed to return Italy to the world stage as a geothermal development hub,”“The lack of long-term planning and clear targets for geothermal usage, especially in district heating and cooling, reflects a missed opportunity.”
Paolo Basile, Steam’s Head of Geosciences and Environment and board member at Unione Geotermica Italiana, expressed concern about the permitting procedures. While the FER2 incentives were finally rolling out for Italy’s geothermal market, the implementation timeline restrictions for the projects could hamper the overall efforts.
“Even when projects meet FER2 requirements, they could face significant delays due to Italy’s slow permitting processes, including potential calls to TAR (Regional Administrative Courts) appeals, where specific interest groups can tie projects up in legal quagmires. Administrative hurdles, lengthy approval periods, and regional complexities make it challenging for developers to get projects off the ground in a timely manner.”
“A more inclusive approach,” “with broader eligibility criteria and streamlined permitting processes, is crucial for Italy to capitalize on this sustainable resource. For Italy to meet its ambitious climate-energy targets, such as in PNIEC, geothermal must move from the sidelines to center stage.”

# St Kitts and Nevis: Islands leading big changes in renewable energy

Developing a geothermal power project has been a transformative process for St. Kitts and Nevis, setting it on a path to being a fully sustainable island state.
![](
![](
![](
As part of the buildup to this year’s Global Sustainable Islands Summit 2025, James Ellsmoor, CEO of Island Innovation, did an interview with Hon. Konris Maynard of the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis. The insights from that conversation have been published below.
The Caribbean twin-island Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis is embarking on an ambitious journey that could transform it into the Western Hemisphere’s first fully sustainable independent nation. During a recent conversation with Hon. Konris Maynard, Minister of Public Infrastructure, Energy, Utilities, and ICT, I gained valuable insights into how this small nation is tackling large energy challenges through innovative approaches to geothermal development.
#### Energy: the central tool for sustainable economic development
For Small Island Developing States (SIDS), energy isn’t just about keeping the lights on—it’s the foundation upon which all economic development rests. Minister Konris Maynard emphasised how the current high energy costs are significantly impacting the Federation’s economy, with the government currently subsidising residential electricity costs through the Fuel Variation Charge to shield consumers from the full burden of escalating global fuel prices.
This subsidy, while necessary in the short term, represents a substantial fiscal challenge apparent across many SIDS that diverts resources from other critical development areas. The economic implications extend beyond household budgets, as high energy costs also deter energy-intensive industries from establishing operations in the Federation, limiting economic diversification and employment opportunities.
The government’s push toward renewable energy, particularly geothermal, represents a strategic shift away from this previous model toward one that promises both economic and environmental benefits.

#### Geothermal: a game-changing resource
Saint Kitts & Nevis possesses distinct advantages for geothermal development that make it particularly promising. As Minister Maynard explained, “The heat amount is much closer to the surface than in other areas of the world, so you don’t have to drill as deep to get to it.” This geological advantage significantly reduces exploration and development costs.
The journey toward harnessing this resource has been complex, involving multiple administrations and financial institutions. The current breakthrough came through providing $17 million USD—$16 million for drilling and $1 million for technical support. The innovative risk-sharing mechanism converts to a concessionary loan if drilling succeeds or a grant if it fails, thereby reducing the financial risk for the Federation.
However, this funding alone wasn’t sufficient to attract top-tier drilling companies to the project. Minister Maynard noted that the $16 million would only fund approximately three wells, making it challenging to entice global drilling experts to mobilise for such a limited scope. The solution came through , bringing the total available funding to $36 million—enough to drill five wells (three production wells and two reinjection wells).
Perhaps equally important was resolving the long-standing political challenge between the federal government and the Nevis Island Administration (NIA). The current administration took a decisive step by passing a resolution in the National Assembly declaring geothermal resources on Nevis a federal asset that will receive federal support. This political alignment between the two administrations sends a clear signal to international partners about the Federation’s united commitment to the SKNICE – St. Kitts and Nevis Islands Climate Enhancement Project, for the benefit of all citizens of St. Kitts and Nevis.

#### Connecting the islands: one electrical grid
One of the most transformative aspects of the geothermal development plan is the potential to create a unified electrical grid connecting St. Kitts and Nevis. Minister Maynard highlighted how this interconnection would allow industries on either island to benefit from renewable energy resources developed on either island, creating a more resilient and flexible energy ecosystem.
“With geothermal, it justifies interconnecting the two islands. St. Kitts and Nevis then becomes one electrical grid, so any industry developed on St. Kitts or Nevis will be able to share any renewable energy resource on either island,”
This approach maximises the utility of renewable resources across the Federation and creates a more attractive environment for industries that require reliable, affordable electricity. The unified grid represents a physical manifestation of the political collaboration now taking place between the federal government and the Nevis Island Administration.
#### Beyond self-sufficiency: becoming a net energy exporter
Perhaps the most ambitious aspect of St. Kitts and Nevis’ energy vision is the potential to move beyond self-sufficiency to become a net energy exporter to neighboring islands. With initial estimates suggesting the geothermal wells could produce between 5-10 megawatts each—potentially yielding 15-30 megawatts—the Federation could generate more electricity than it currently needs.
Minister Maynard envisions two potential avenues for this surplus energy. First, direct electricity export through undersea cables to nearby islands. Having personally visited Mallorca and witnessed its 250km undersea interconnection with Spain, the Minister noted that Antigua is just 60km away and St. Martin approximately 50km—making such connections technically feasible.
Second, using surplus energy for what energy experts call “Power-to-X” applications—converting electricity into other valuable products like hydrogen or ammonia. This approach could create new industries and export opportunities beyond simply selling electricity.
“With this vast resource of geothermal, it opens up industries but also justifies interconnecting with other islands,“Right here in the Caribbean, we can be a beacon of energy that interconnects with these islands.”

#### Becoming part of History
As St. Kitts and Nevis prepares to host the and the , Minister Maynard extended an invitation to renewable energy stakeholders worldwide to participate in these events.
“This is an opportunity to be part of history,” he emphasised. “We are on a path to make St. Kitts and Nevis the first fully sustainable island state in the Western hemisphere and perhaps even the world.”
The Minister’s closing observation captures the essence of what makes this small nation’s approach to energy so compelling:**
**_“St. Kitts and Nevis is small enough to make big changes.”_
The Federation is demonstrating how opposing political parties can align behind a shared vision of sustainability, and how a nation with limited resources can leverage strategic partnerships to undertake transformative energy projects.
For those interested in renewable energy development, particularly in island contexts, the upcoming presents a unique opportunity to witness this ambitious vision taking shape and to explore partnership opportunities in what promises to be a showcase for sustainable island development.

The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process has officially begun for the geothermal resource exploration project to be carried out by Dogal Hayat Jeotermal ve Tarim A.S. in the village of Yesilyurt in the Ayvacik district of Canakkale, Türkiye.
The Project Introduction File (PTD) submitted to the Canakkale Governorship has been evaluated under Article 16 of the EIA Regulation, marking the formal initiation of the process. As part of the project, a 1,900-meter production well and a 1,000-meter reinjection well are planned to be drilled.
Previously, a “No EIA Required” decision was issued for drilling at two different locations within the same license area. However, a public meeting led to the the selection of a new drill site for the well originally planned at Parcel 183, Block 1 in the village of Yesilyurt. Following geophysical studies, Parcel 57 and Block 174 were designated as the new exploration area.
Once the EIA process is completed, field operations will begin. Additionally, permits from the State Hydraulic Works (DS?) and the Provincial Directorate of Agriculture and Forestry will be required for drilling on agricultural land. Since the EIA area is classified as “Agricultural Land” in the Balikesir-Canakkale Regional Planning Map (1/100,000 Scale Environmental Plan), the impact of activities on agricultural areas will also be carefully assessed.
Geothermal exploration activities have picked up pace in recent years in the Ayvacik region of Canakkale. Companies involved in exploration in Ayvacik (both surface studies and drilling) include Tuzla Geothermal, Bakrom Mining, and Transmark Renewables.

Pointing out that Türkiye, one of the leading geothermal countries in the world, utilizes only 11% of its discovered resource potential, JED Chairman Ali Kindap
#### Financial Burden and Risk on Investors in Drilling
Kindap emphasized that the definition of Strategic Investment
“We request that geothermal energy investments be included under the definition of ‘strategic investment,’ which has functioned efficiently to bring remarkable projects to our country. Geothermal energy is a fully domestic and national resource that lies beneath us everywhere, does not rely on imports, and serves the common welfare of the Turkish people. There is no other energy source that is as local and independent.”
Highlighting the uninterrupted and reliable nature of geothermal energy compared to other renewable energy sources, Kindap noted that it is a significant advantage for Türkiye to meet these critical energy needs with a clean and abundant domestic resource.
Kindap also stressed that geothermal drilling, technically similar to oil drilling, places the entire financial burden and risk on the investor. He argued that including these investments in the strategic investment
#### Türkiye Could Become an Energy Exporter
Referring to the current installed capacity of geothermal energy-based electricity generation in Türkiye, which stands at 1,700 MW5,000 MW
Kindap underscored that the **63 geothermal power plants operating in Türkiye** utilize internationally recognized, environmentally friendly production technologies and provided the following evaluation:
“Geothermal energy investments are unique localization projects, offering Türkiye’s resources for the prosperity of its people. As the Turkish geothermal energy sector, we bring these projects into operation with astounding speed and success, using our own capital, workforce, and technology. We are working to ensure our country benefits more from this endless resource and creates additional value. Türkiye is an energy-rich nation.
By giving more importance to clean energy resources, supporting and incentivizing them, and bringing them online, our country can easily rise to the level of an ‘energy-exporting nation,’ which may seem like a dream today. By utilizing geothermal energy, an infinite resource, to serve our nation’s common welfare, we can elevate our fourth-place global ranking to a clear leadership position. As the Turkish geothermal sector, we are ready to ignite this grand vision with our investors, engineering expertise, human resources, and financial strength.”

Announced this month, the French municipalities of Melun and Vaux-le-Pénil, in Seine-et-Marne (the wider Paris region), are joining forces to strengthen their commitment to the energy transition. Supported by Dalkia, the two cities are launching the expansion of their heating network and the drilling of a new geothermal well in 2026, supplemented by a heat pump system.
The network is planned to be fuelled by nearly 80% renewable and inexhaustible energy. The city of Melun is thus continuing its commitment, having already set an example in 1969 by choosing geothermal energy for the first time to feed its heating network.
The network will expand this year in both cities and will pass under the Seine to extend south of Melun. It will extend for an additional 17 km, or more than 43 km of pipeline, and will include 115 new substations. It will provide 68 GWh of additional heat and cover the heating and domestic hot water needs of 18,500 equivalent homes.
“The city of Melun’s investment in geothermal energy is historic and is about to reach a new milestone. In a context of rising energy costs and global warming, this choice appears more relevant than ever for the future. This choice allows Melun residents to benefit from real energy savings, since for a “typical” home, geothermal energy represents a heating cost of approximately 30% compared to a collective gas heating solution.”
These new connections and installations will save 12,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. This figure is in addition to the 16,000 tonnes of CO2 already saved annually thanks to the existing district heating network, for a total of 28,000 tonnes of CO2 saved annually.
“In the context of the upgrading of the heating networks in the city of Vauxle-Pénil, supported by ADEME, we are pleased that this partnership can provide a new opportunity for our energy transition policy. The expansion of our shared network is a future challenge for renewable energies. This will require a dynamic policy that will need to be integrated into our housing obligations. We welcome the significant administrative, legal, and technical work that has enabled us to implement this joint public service delegation project.”
This new contract signed with
The drilling, development and modernization work on the new network represents a total investment of nearly EUR 75 million.

For geothermal power generation capacity to expand worldwide, operators must put more focus on optimizing the performance of their geothermal turbines.
![](

![](
Geothermal energy is a rising star in the global effort to reduce emissions, ensure energy security, and boost economies. However, there are challenges in geothermal power operations that require constant vigilance and some degree of planning to ensure the optimal performance of power plants.
According to Donald Leger, Manager for Steam Turbine Application Engineering at
### The harsh realities of geothermal engineering
The global production of geothermal energy is expected to soar to , growing 1.68% annually over the next five years. Getting to this point, however, is likely not going to be smooth sailing.
Every geothermal plant – whether dry steam, flash steam, or indirect cycle – needs to follow best practices to optimize performance, safeguard equipment, and extend lifecycles. Increasing the reliability of geothermal assets means saving on costs and extracting the most value possible out of them.
For all geothermal projects, turbines always face steam conditions and chemistry that need to be addressed regardless of the OEM. With geothermal fluids easily capable of eroding conventional materials at an alarming rate – including very damaging short-term spikes in pH – even small variations in hardness and chemistry can have a significant impact on your turbines.
With some clever and prudent thinking, geothermal operators can ensure that their turbines run efficiently. Proactive steps include:
* Appropriate material selection – choosing the right materials to withstand harsh conditions
* Robust shutdown and moisture removal processes – proper procedures during outages
* Periodic steam path monitoring – regular checks and repairs
* Steam chemistry control – strict regulation to prevent erosion and corrosion
* Retrofit of steam paths
![]( welding in shaft area of steam turbine rotor (source: EthosEnergy)
### Combatting challenges with state-of-the-art solutions
Staying one step ahead and being prepared for anything is crucial in avoiding major problems related to turbines in geothermal power generation. Let’s look at some of the factors that operators need to consider:
* #### Moisture
Moisture problems are incredibly common in geothermal plants, often causing wear-and-tear damage to the tenons (the protruding parts used to attach shrouds to the blades on the turbine rotor). This happens mostly due to harsh conditions like corrosive steam. Combined with the risk of chemical deposition, moisture problems can cause a disaster if left untreated.
To tackle moisture and tenon erosion in geothermal turbines and to reduce tenon erosion change to integral covers, EthosEnergy provides a Stellite™ shield or solid coupon.
Integral covers are specially designed to eliminate tenons, as the shroud is machined integral with the blade using accurate geometry to ensure proper blade damping. Existing turbines or new turbine designs can be equipped with blades having integral covers for life extension.
Another of the design improvements introduced by EthosEnergy includes control stages with integral covers made from titanium. The material density lowers the stress on the wheel and blades, while the titanium’s material properties minimize fouling, which can decrease the turbine’s flow capacity and, in turn, diminish output.
By implementing these solutions, operators can ensure that turbines operate more efficiently and have longer service intervals. These ultimately result in reduced downtime and lower maintenance costs.
* #### Tall blades
In geothermal turbines, tall blades are particularly susceptible to harsh operating conditions, including high moisture content and corrosive steam. To enhance the durability and performance of these blades, advanced material options well-known for their strength and corrosion resistance can be considered, including:
* 403 SS/X15 – 403 Stainless Steel (SS), well known for its solid mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. The X15 variant is often used for its superior strength and durability in corrosive environments.
* M152 (Jet Heat) – this advanced alloy is known for its high-erosion resistance and resistance to oxidation and corrosion.
* 17-4 PH – this precipitation-hardening stainless steel also provides high strength and hardness, as well as excellent corrosion resistance.
* Titanium – renowned for its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and excellent corrosion and erosion resistance.
EthosEnergy also provides treatments to enhance the durability of tall blades, such as laser hardening, flame hardening, and various coatings like metallic layers to provide additional protection.
By using this combination of advanced materials and treatments, geothermal operators can ensure that tall blades in geothermal turbines can withstand extreme conditions. This results in improved efficiency, reduced maintenance costs over time, fewer parts replacements, and less downtime.
* #### Analysis
Even with the proper selection of materials, operators still need to monitor and analyze the performance of their turbines. Analysis is key to understanding the natural frequencies of blade dynamics:
* Vibratory stresses at resonance
* Blade and rotor centrifugal stress
* Blade fixation issues
EthosEnergy can provide the experience and technical expertise to analyze these blade dynamics at each geothermal plant, helping customers to stay within allowable limits.
* #### Repair, reblade, redesign
To keep a geothermal plant running as it should, repair, reblade, and redesign solutions ensure the best outcomes for turbines, whether it’s wheel welds or reconfiguring blades based on failure analysis, erosion issues, or control systems.
* #### Inspections
Regular inspections – including visual, magnetic particle, and other forms of non-destructive testing (NDT) – are also vital for geothermal turbines. Inspections can highlight any issues like surface cracks, blade and shroud damage, erosion, and corrosion. Operators need to address all of these as soon as possible to avoid further issues.
Inspections may require ongoing solutions to be implemented. Making these repairs or replacements right away will help to avoid costly downtime. These solutions can include:
* Improved materials, coatings, and steam quality for blade issues
* Stainless steels upgrades
* Inconel weld repairs to inner and outer diaphragm rings
* Improved moisture separation features
* Wheel replacements with improved materials and lower stress designs

### Full steam ahead for geothermal plants
In the exciting race towards renewable power, geothermal power plant operators need the expertise and solutions required to maximize equipment efficiency and production. This is critical regardless of location, OEM, or lifecycle stage. With their proven capabilities and innovative, independent approaches, EthosEnergy is ready to support the growing geothermal sector in addressing challenges such as moisture and corrosion.
As geothermal energy becomes an increasingly vital element in the global energy mix, geothermal power operators can benefit greatly from improved turbine efficiency and lower operations and maintenance costs.

The U.S. Bureau of Land Management Utah State Office will hold a competitive geothermal lease sale on April 8, 2025. The lease will be offering 15 parcels totaling 50,813 acres on public lands in Beaver, Iron, and Sevier counties. The auction will be held online at
The BLM has authority to manage geothermal resource leasing, exploration, and development on approximately 245 million surface acres of public lands, as well as in any lands where the United States retains the subsurface mineral estate.
For each parcel leased, 50% of the bid, rental receipts, and subsequent royalties go to the State of Utah, an additional 25% goes to the county where the lease is located, and the remaining 25% goes to the U.S. Treasury.
BLM issues competitive geothermal leases for an initial 10-year period. The leases allow the lessee to explore for and develop potential geothermal resources. The leases may be extended if the lessee establishes production or provides proof of diligent exploration.
Before including parcels in a lease sale, BLM conducts an environmental review process in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and other laws to consider potential environmental impacts and to determine appropriate stipulations to protect other resources values. This environmental review includes opportunities for public comment and can be found on the
All BLM geothermal decisions must be consistent with the terms, conditions, and decisions in the applicable land use plan. Before permitting any surface-disturbing activities, BLM will conduct an appropriate level of NEPA review when processing applications for exploration or development plans. The review may include site-specific measures in addition to the stipulations attached to the lease at the time of sale.
Utah has seen an increasing interest and development, which include among others the Utah FORGE project and Fervo Energy’s groundbreaking Cape project.

The 3rd Taiwan International Geothermal Conference will be held April 24-25, 2025 in Taipeh with a focus on current issues in geothermal development, as well as EGS and Advanced Geothermal Systems.

To advance geothermal energy development in Taiwan, foster international collaboration, and strengthen industry partnerships, the Energy Administration, Ministry of Economic Affairs, R.O.C. (Taiwan),Taiwan International Geothermal Conference 2025April 24–25, 2025,CPC Building, Taipei
The conference will cover Taiwan’s geothermal energy progress, global trends, and cutting-edge technologies, including Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS)Advanced Geothermal Systems (AGS)
The Energy Agency lowered the 2025 geothermal target from 200 MW to 20 MW in 2023, and then raised the 2030 geothermal target to 1.2-1.5 GW in 2025. Taiwan’s geothermal targets are finally catching up to international development trajectories and successful models.
Recently, the international community has significantly increased geothermal targets for the net zero strategy, hoping to inject advanced technology and investment from the oil industry into the geothermal industry, which has huge potential. The successful commercialization of new-generation geothermal technology in Germany and the United States is a key factor, which is also a blind spot ignored by mainstream media and traditional energy experts.
Taiwan’s geothermal industry is still in its early stages of development. The current situation is similar to the situation six years ago when offshore wind power was first demonstrated in Taiwan. The cost is high and the construction speed is slow. It is still overcoming the learning curve, which is why many traditional energy experts are pessimistic. To date, Taiwan has introduced advanced industrial chains through international cooperation. Offshore wind farms are no longer afraid of strong typhoons and have gradually evolved into the next stage of floating wind turbine farms, becoming a successful model among Asian democratic countries, far surpassing Japan and South Korea.
Many energy experts are unaware that Taiwan will have four geothermal power plants connected to the grid this year, and that their individual well power generation capacity has not yet completed the learning curve, with a production capacity of only about 1 MW. Currently, geothermal power generation has been commercialized in 32 countries. Driven by mature industrial chains, the single-well production capacity in emerging countries can reach 4-7 MW, such as Chile and Croatia, which is more than 10 times the current average in Taiwan. This learning curve depends on the degree of cooperation in the international industrial chain, which is exactly the same as offshore wind power.
The United States is the world’s largest geothermal power producer. Its Department of Energy has long invested in and subsidized geothermal-related technology research and development. The oil industry and RE100 technology industry have both invested heavily in geothermal technology. The development trend of geothermal energy has been further stimulated by President Trump’s coming to power.
It is expected that the average cost of next-generation geothermal power generation will be about US$0.06-0.07 per kWh in five years, and will drop to US$0.045 per kWh in 2035, which is much lower than the cost estimated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (US$0.2 per kWh) and lower than the cost of advanced nuclear energy at US$0.099 per kWh.

“Projekt THERMO,”
Part of the collaboration will be the assessment of the feasibility of deploying Eden’s “Electrical Reservoir Stimulation” technology in Projekt THERMO, which is being developed by TerraThermo. The Parties are expecting that Eden’s technology would be implemented in the Projekt THERMO in 2026/2027, when the relevant wells are drilled.
“We are delighted to be working with Eden GeoPower, to bring their technology to Europe. The next generation of natural resource recovery technologies are critical in the energy transition. Europe has a long history of geothermal heat and power generation, but facilities have often been unable to achieve required production rates due to restrictions on traditional hydraulic fracturing, so we expect that Eden’s technology will be extremely important for project developers and will be supported by legislators and the public,”
“We are delighted to partner with TerraThermo to bring our technology to Europe. We believe that our technology is ideally suited to Projekt THERMO and the operating environment in Europe. With our alternative, water-minimal electric based rock stimulation technology, we can increase permeability and avoid the injection of large volumes of water into the reservoir,”
“We believe that our technology can be a game changer for the European renewable energy market, particularly for deep geothermal. Our new engagement with TerraThermo highlights our goals to bring the value of our technology to the European market and assist many countries in achieving their renewable energy goals.”
#### Support for a project pipeline
Beyond Projekt THERMO, the Parties have agreed to collaborate more widely in Europe. TerraThermo expects that the 12MW geothermal power plant would be the first of many, with the potential for multiple projects in Germany and other European countries.
TerraThermo’s project development pipeline (including Projekt THERMO) is aligned with Eden’s objectives of enhancing subsurface permeability in the geothermal industry. TerraThermo will seek to use Eden’s technology in its projects, where possible. The company had just recently secured investment from alfa8 to support Projekt THERMO.
#### Eden’s “Electrical Reservoir Stimulation” Technology
Eden has developed a first-of-its-kind Electrical Reservoir Stimulation (ERS) technology to increase the recovery of natural resources and improve the economics of resource recovery with minimal environmental impact.
Its patented ERS Technology uses electricity to enhance permeability, increasing the recovery of new and existing assets. Eden’s technology reduces water consumption, curbs carbon emissions, and mitigates the seismicity risks that come with traditional hydraulic fracturing, making the process fundamentally more sustainable.
Eden’s unique approach is equally well suited to enhancing subsurface permeability across industries, including geothermal.
By using high-voltage electricity and advanced reservoir monitoring techniques, Eden increases rock permeability while controlling the direction of the generated fracture network, targeting specific subsurface areas more precisely. This allows for a step change improvement in reservoir productivity and, as a result, the economic viability of energy transition initiatives that lever geological reservoirs.
ERS is an evolution from traditional hydraulic-fracturing methods which are water-intensive and create uncontrollable fractures, or “short-circuits,” that can hinder fluid flow and obstruct re-stimulation, functionally ending a reservoir’s economic viability. Additional benefits of ERS include a substantial reduction in the number of trucks necessary for fluid and proppant transportation, emissions from wastewater treatment, pumping horsepower requirements, and seismic events. The result is a reduction in CO2 emissions, water consumption, and associated environmental hazards compared to traditional hydraulic-fracturing operations.

# Storing energy underground : Reservoir thermal energy storage shows promise
!Storing energy underground : Reservoir thermal energy storage shows promise Storing renewable energy underground: Thermal energy storage shows promise - a guest article by Teverra
![ ](
![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 12 Feb 2025
Reservoir thermal energy storage has huge potential for increasing the application of geothermal, particularly as a complement to solar and wind power.
![](
![](
![](
Studies on the potential of storing renewable energy underground have been ongoing for some time. In the last few years, this field of study has gained momentum associated with the continued deployment of low-cost variable renewable energy (VRE) (Green et al., 2021). Research institutions and technology companies are examining ways to safely and economically harness the subsurface as a storage medium, which has the potential to significantly accelerate the growth of energy storage and capacity in the coming years (Sharan et al., 2020).
This guest article written by
Currently, thermal energy production (not storage) for electricity is still not competitive with natural gas and other renewables. Geothermal power is a low-carbon source of energy with no intermittent problems. However, the costs associated with drilling wells in deep and hard-rock formations, where temperatures are hot enough for electricity production, makes it difficult to compete with other technologies aimed at power generation.
The areas where a suitable temperature gradient is at a reasonable depth are not found everywhere which limits the technology to parts of the US and the world (NREL, 2023). Figure below shows resource availability and colocation limitation not available everywhere.
![]( Resources of the United States available and colocation limitation – Not available everywhere (NREL, 2023)
#### What is reservoir thermal energy storage?
The general concept of reservoir thermal energy storage (RTES) is simple. The Earth acts as a giant thermal battery to store excess renewable energy like solar and wind. When paired with these VRE sources, RTES produces a complete, reliable and resilient renewable energy solution.
For example, solar energy production typically peaks in the summer when daylight is the longest, which often leads to surplus electricity generation. This surplus, if paired with sufficient storage, could provide energy beyond diurnal electricity cycles, up to 1000+ hours of energy storage. Similarly, wind patterns can vary by location and season, with some regions experiencing consistent seasonal wind patterns. Seasonal high wind energy generation is valuable by itself but can be fully utilized and monetized when paired with equivalent seasonal energy storage, that being, RTES.
A reliable, resilient 24/7 electricity grid is closer to commerciality thanks to research and development in RTES and unique systems being developed, such as Teverra’s
RTES systems like ResStor are a potential solution to the VRE conundrum because these systems ensure a steady and dependable supply of clean electricity. Still, this system is not without challenges. To date, RTES is still at the research and development phase, requiring key field demonstrations and technology advancements to become an integrated part of the current and future energy system.
To understand the size of the industrial heat market, the Figure below shows the data for heat and cooling demand for the US.? For heat use in the moderate temperature range (125 – 250 °F / 52 – 121 °C), there is a market demand of 350+ trillion BTUs per year.
![]( (a) heating and (b) cooling demand by U.S. in Terajoule (TJ) (Oh & Beckers, 2023)
This article highlights the significant role that these systems can play, providing a sense of reassurance about the reliability of renewable energy. By knowing how to design and operate these systems effectively, we can pave the way for a future where geothermal energy is critical in storing and delivering clean power from renewable sources.
Here, we explain how RTES works and how it provides energy resiliency for long-term VRE sources, using the Teverra ResStor system as an example. We discuss how it can still be improved as well as point out the additional benefits to implementation of RTES systems.
#### How ResStor works
The ResStor system operates as a thermal energy battery. Excess energy is used to heat water. This hot water is injected underground through strategically placed wells into permeable rock formations. The Earth, with low thermal conductivity and diffusivity, acts as a natural insulator, trapping the heat within the rock. When energy is needed, the hot water is extracted from the reservoir and used. This can be used as direct heat or used to generate power through a conventional geothermal power plant. Because of the natural thermal energy storage properties of the subsurface, this system provides a long-term solution to energy storage.(Porlles et al., 2023)

#### Optimizing the system: Well design makes a difference
The roundtrip thermal efficiency of RTES systems is one of the key value drivers of these systems. Still, there are challenges associated with accessing the significant subsurface space required for 1000+ hours of energy storage.
Recent studies have yielded significant insights into optimizing RTES system designs for maximum efficiency. Studies have compared various well configurations, mainly focusing on the placement and orientation of the wells within the reservoir.
These findings hold significant weight because they can significantly impact the economic feasibility of large-scale RTES projects. By identifying well designs that maximize heat capture and minimize energy loss, drilling advances and potentially lower drilling costs can be achieved; this translates to RTES becoming a more attractive option for large-scale renewable energy integration. Optimizing well design paves the way for cost-effective and efficient RTES systems, accelerating their potential to become a cornerstone technology for a clean energy future.
Beyond efficiency: The broader benefits of RTES
The promise of RTES extends far beyond simply addressing the intermittent challenge of renewables. Additional benefits include location flexibility, grid stability, and environmental benefits.
For location flexibility, unlike conventional geothermal resources, which are limited to geologically active areas, systems like ResStor can be created almost anywhere with suitable underground rock formations. This adaptability opens possibilities for utilizing renewable energy sources in regions with limited geothermal resources but abundant solar or wind energy.
Regarding grid stability, ResStor can act as a buffer for the electricity grid, providing a reliable power source during peak demand periods or unexpected outages, which helps to stabilize the grid and reduce reliance on fossil fuel backup generators.
Through these added benefits, ResStor and similar systems mitigate climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by storing excess renewable energy and displacing fossil fuel generation.
The road ahead: Challenges and opportunities
While the potential of RTES systems is undisputable, various challenges must be overcome before widespread adoption occurs. These key challenges include cost reduction and environmental impact.
Drilling and operating systems like ResStor still require a significant upfront investment and are cost reduction constrained by wellbore and renewable energy input cost. Research and development efforts are crucial to reducing drilling costs and optimizing system design for improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness. While the geothermal industry does not control the cost of the incoming energy source, overall system efficiency improvements make the input energy more valuable on a cost per energy unit basis.
One concern not completely addressed to date is the environmental impact of RTES systems. The potential for water contamination is one common concern, as well as the increase in wellbores and associated energy system footprint.
Both environmental concerns can be mitigated through optimized system design, specifically the well field development. Water contamination is mitigated through several design parameters. First, the overall well design is made to hydrologically separate freshwater aquifers from deeper, non-potable aquifers. Through this design, water contamination risks are mitigated. Additionally, ResStor targets non-potable aquifers, and is performed in a non-consumptive fashion, so freshwater is in no way a part of the ResStor system.
Similarly, the wells and the well field can be designed to optimize energy storage efficiency. Several wellbore designs and well placement designs were tested as part of the ResStor design development, with numerical simulations used to optimize the power density per well and round trip thermal efficiency. By producing an optimized energy efficiency per wellbore, the footprint for the energy system can also be optimized, that is, the greatest energy density per unit of land use.
#### A brighter future with subsurface batteries
RTES systems including ResStor offer a groundbreaking solution for storing renewable energy and unlocking the full potential of solar and wind power. By addressing the intermittent nature of these energy sources and by providing a reliable, clean, and location-flexible storage option, RTES systems can be pivotal in our transition to a clean energy future. Still, their full potential is not yet realized (Armstrong, 2022).
A field demonstration is required to show this energy storage system as a technically and commercially viable energy storage system. It will also provide an opportunity to identify continued challenges. Further collaboration between private industry, public support, higher education, national laboratories, and policymakers can further enhance RTES capabilities and make this energy storage technology a cornerstone technology for a sustainable energy future.

Exploratory drilling for the Magglingen geothermal project in Switzerland is planned to start by the end of 2027. The goal for the well would be provide information to evaluate whether the deep water be used for a geothermal plant at the Federal Office of Sport’s (FOSP) National Sports Center in Magglingen.
If exploration drilling is successful, the well can likely begin supplying heat to the Magglingen National Sports Center of the
In 2023, the Federal Office for Climate Protection (BBL) conducted an underground survey in the region around Magglingen. The aim of the extensive investigations was to obtain the most precise possible geological map of Magglingen’s subsurface and to gain insights into potential warm deep water sources for geothermal heat generation. The analysis of the collected data suggests several potential deep water reservoirs.
From this initial image of the subsurface, the course and location of geological layers and faults can be derived. Due to the complex subsurface beneath Magglingen, an area of uncertainty remains in the interpretation of this data and the resulting model. Further measures and investigations are intended to further reduce the uncertainty and the associated risk of failure in any drilling operation.
Exploratory drilling is necessary for many geothermal projects because the exact location of the deep water is uncertain and key parameters such as water temperature, water volume, and flow rate are unknown. These factors are crucial for the economic use of the deep water. The planned exploratory drilling at a depth of approximately 1,500 to 2,300 meters will reduce existing uncertainties and project risks. At the same time, it will provide important insights into the subsurface.

#### Funding sought from the Federal Parliament
The implementation of the exploratory drilling and the drilling for deep water utilization requires funding approval from the Federal Parliament. The Federal Office for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FOBL) will compile the costs of the drilling by the end of 2025 and will likely present them to Parliament as part of the 2026 Real Estate Dispatch. In addition to funding approval from Parliament, drilling permits from the cantonal authorities are also required for the drilling for deep water utilization.
These investigations are part of many other measures being taken by the Federal Office of Public Safety (BBL) to reduce environmental impacts at the Federal Office of Public Safety (FOSP) site. For example, a district heating network for most of the FOSPO buildings in Magglingen was completed last year, powered by wood pellets from a temporary energy center. In addition, the appropriate infrastructure at the Magglingen National Sports Center is being continuously equipped with photovoltaic systems.

At the end of 2023, France’s Ministry of Energy Transition officially published the national action plan for the deployment of geothermal energy to meet the needs for renewable heating and cooling for individual and collective buildings in Mainland France. The action plan proposes 27 priority actions and 23 complementary actions aimed at accelerating the development of surface and deep geothermal energy.
The partnership agreement between the
The objectives set out by the regional strategy plant for Nouvelle-Aquitaine establish a target of 3500 GWh of geothermal energy output by 2030. In the tertiary and residential sectors alone, the cumulative energy consumption that could be replaced by geothermal energy is 27.9 TWh, or 16.5% of the total energy consumption in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. This would represent savings of 4,600 million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year.
The general guidelines of the agreement that had been signed are as follows:
* Promote the creation of a regional ecosystem in favor of the development of geothermal energy.
* Train stakeholders in the surface and deep geothermal sector in Nouvelle-Aquitaine.
* Promote surface geothermal energy and deep geothermal energy.
* Encourage the development of the sector by improving knowledge and securing demand while financing surface and deep geothermal projects.
A regional ecosystem around the Avenia geothermal cluster is being created with the strengthening of the actions of the Odeys and Solténa cluster, the R3Tesna network at the research and development level, the regional representative of the
The Nouvelle-Aquitaine Region is already considered a pioneer in equipping high schools with geothermal heating – 11 high schools already have geothermal heating systems, 5 more are under construction, and 3 more are being studied. The region had set a budget of EUR 196 million for 2022-2028 to invest on renewable energy development with priority given to geothermal.
As part of the regional geothermal development plan, the State, via ADEME , has financed 71 feasibility studies and 31 investment projects for a total of 7.9 million in aid in 2024.
All of these actions help to structure the sector to make it attractive and recognized throughout the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. On June 19 and 20, 2025, the national geothermal days will be held in Biarritz, organized by the AFPG with the Avenia cluster and ADEME as partners.

The Bureau of Land Management has published a scoping letter to solicit for comments on a proposed geothermal lease sale in Owyhee County, Idaho.

The
Comments made on this proposal should be received by 15 January 2025
The need for the action is BLM’s responsibility to respond to the nomination of public lands for geothermal leasing under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, as amended, and the National Energy Policy Act of 2005 to promote the development of geothermal energy on the public domain.
The Bruneau Field Office is considering a proposal to offer 109 parcels totaling 50,126 acres in a competitive Geothermal Lease Sale. These parcels were nominated by the public. The nominated parcels are located within the Snake River Plain, in rural areas. Land uses include livestock grazing and agriculture, utility and road rights-of-way (ROW), and wildlife habitat.
A geothermal lease typically grants the lessee access to geothermal resources in the lease area for a period of 10 years. The terms of the lease require the lessee to show a certain level of diligence toward developing the geothermal resources within the lease area or the lease may be terminated. Once an area is developed for productive use of geothermal energy, the lease allows the lessee use of the resource for 35 years with a right of renewal for another 55 years.
The BLM is required to hold a competitive lease sale at least once every two-years if there are nominations pending (43 CFR § 3202.13). Highly successful geothermal lease sales have been done by the BLM in the past years, particularly in Nevada.

A “Geothermal Master Plan” envisions the use of technologies to maximize the potential and opportunities in Indonesia’s existing geothermal fields. The company thus proposes the concept of a “geothermal carbon neutral park” that will help reduce risks and ensure sustainability in geothermal project development.
Toyo had previously signed an MOU with PT Medco Power for a joint study on geothermal opportunities based on this same concept.
To generate power, for example, the project plans to employ a closed-loop system that can extract heat even from fields with insufficient steam. In addition to generating electricity, extra value can be extracted from a geothermal field by producing next-generation fuels such as green hydrogen, and such green fuels as ammonia and methanol. Another option is to recover valuable mineral resources in the geothermal brine, including silica and lithium.

Toyo ultimately aims to develop a concept that will allow for geothermal development in sites that previously may not be considered very attractive. “Although geothermal energy has great potential, when it comes to its actual development, there may not be a sufficient number of locations that have both the necessary amount of water and heat,”
Since the 1970s, Toyo Engineering has established relationships with entities in Indonesia to construct fertilizer and ammonia production facilities. In 2012, it acquired

Fraunhofer IEG's real-world laboratory for geothermal research in Germany will receive EUR 52 million from the federal and state coal phase-out program.
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
The “Fraunhofer Real-World Laboratory for Geothermal Energy Geotechnologies and Georesources (FRELA-GEO3)” research platform by
The project is being implemented with partners energy supplier RWE Power AG, the Aachen municipal utilities STAWAG, RWTH Aachen, and the Ruhr University Bochum.
With the funding approved, the FRELA-GEO3 project will now progress from planning to the implementation phase with the aim of creating a large research infrastructure for geothermal that is unique in Europe. The next step would be to conduct a large-scale geophysical survey of the subsurface in the Aachen urban region and drill two exploration boreholes. Moreover, Fraunhofer IEG will build a research center in Weisweiler for georesources and decarbonization.
#### A decisive step for geothermal in North Rhine-Westphalia
For the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, the project is an important step in the implementation of the Geothermal Energy Master Plan. The project will contribute to the ramp up of geothermal energy in the region by providing subsurface data which will then be the bases for subsequent geothermal projects. If the exploration results are positive, the people, municipalities and companies in the region will have the opportunity to tap into geothermal as a cost-effective and regional heat source.
“The “Fraunhofer Real Laboratory” can make a decisive contribution to this for the Rhineland region and the Aachen urban region. With this project, we are jointly and innovatively driving forward the heat transition in North Rhine-Westphalia. We are focusing on transparency. I have great confidence in the Fraunhofer IEG, which is actively involving citizens. Together we are making NRW more sustainable,”
“The southern Rhineland has a rich history of using its natural energy resources – from the use of thermal water in Roman times for local heating and later for the medieval cloth industry, to the modern spa industry, to industrial hard coal mines and modern open-cast lignite mining,”
“Deep geothermal energy could therefore be the next chapter for the energy regions on both sides of the Rhine.”
#### Breakdown of the funding
The FRELA-GEO3 will be financed in three components.
The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection is supporting the program with around EUR 8.15 million through the STARK program. The state of North Rhine-Westphalia is contributing a further EUR 0.815 million to support the transition of coal regions.
The state of North Rhine-Westphalia in accordance with the Coal Regions Investment Act (InvKG) will provide EUR 36.54 million for the geophysical measurements, exploration drilling, and associated infrastructure. The funding according to InvKG is divided into a federal share (EUR 29.6 million) and a state share (6.94 million).
Lastly, the construction of the technical center in Weisweiler will receive around EUR 6.5 million from thhe joint funding of the Fraunhofer Society by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the Ministry of Culture and Science of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia (50% / 50%).
In total, the project will receive funding of EUR 52.005 million over four years.

# New short film highlights geothermal work being done in Northern Ireland
!New short film highlights geothermal work being done in Northern Ireland The GeoEnergy NI short film, ‘Unearthing the heat beneath our feet’, enjoyed a special premiere at the Ulster Museum, Belfast as part of the NI Science Festival. Pictured at the screening are Conor Lydon, Head of Groundwater & Geothermal (UK & Ireland) at Tetra Tech, Dr Marie Cowan, Director at the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland (GSNI), Paulo Ross, Broadcaster & Presenter, and Ryan White, Director of Heat, Buildings and Climate Change at the Department for the Economy

‘Unearthing the heat beneath our feet’ the Stormont Estate, Belfast and College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise (CAFRE), Greenmount Campus near Antrim. The short film covers a wide spectrum of geothermal activities including exploration, research, and education. It also highlights the perspective of homeowners who are already benefitting from geothermal heating.
The GeoEnergy NI project is being delivered by the Department for the Economy (DfE), as part of the Executive’s Energy Strategy, with scientific support from the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland (GSNI).
The project recognises that despite having huge untapped potential, geothermal energy is currently underutilised and less well known in Northern Ireland compared with other renewable energy sources. Alongside the exploration activities, the project team therefore undertook a high-profile and multi-layered engagement programme to inform the public, stakeholders, and schools about the exciting potential of geothermal energy here.
The documentary follows local broadcaster and geology enthusiast Paulo Ross as he explores the potential and benefits of geothermal energy – engaging with businesses, academics, and students as well as some local households who are already utilising geothermal energy. He also explores the mobile GeoEnergy Discovery Centre, which is doing a stellar job of educating young students about geothermal energy and the subsurface.
The data and learnings from the GeoEnergy NI project will help refine our understanding of the subsurface in Northern Ireland, which will be essential to help us unearth the heat beneath our feet as part of wider efforts to achieve net-zero energy related emissions by 2050. It will also increase awareness of the geothermal potential here and support the development of a geothermal industry, which would produce many high value jobs and skills across the region, through direct employment and spin-off industries.
Speaking at the launch of the short film,Ryan White, Director of Heat, Buildings and Climate Change at the Department for the Economy, said; “The GeoEnergy NI project has been an incredibly successful demonstration of Northern Ireland’s geothermal potential – literally helping us unearth the heat beneath our feet. Through capturing the story of the two-year long journey in this short film, we can now reach even more people and showcase the important role geothermal energy can play in how we decarbonise our energy sector in pursuit of net zero carbon targets by 2050.”
Coinciding with the launch of the short film, GeoEnergy NI has also released its latest educational resource pack, suitable for Key Stage 4 curriculums within our schools.
Dr Marie Cowan, Director at the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland (GSNI) added; “The documentary showcases how the GeoEnergy NI team has engaged with schools, businesses, organisations and policy makers to bring about a future powered by geothermal energy. To support these efforts, GSNI have developed a range of educational resources, including our most recent Key Stage 4 teaching packs. These and the GeoEnergy NI project website provide a wealth of information about Northern Ireland’s geothermal potential, so you can also explore the heat beneath your feet from the comfort of your classroom or home.”

Last week, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has launched web platform
GeoBridge provides easy access to information on a wide range of geothermal topics, covering everything from geothermal heat pump (GHP) installation to careers in geothermal, educational tools, and cost-saving opportunities for businesses.
GeoBridge serves as a launch point, directing interested parties to data and tools, events, educational resources, STEM programs, permitting and regulatory information, and other resources that can be used to understand, evaluate, and discover geothermal opportunities.
“GeoBridge fills an important gap by providing a single, publicly accessible, searchable portal that facilitates easy access to geothermal knowledge and information,” said Elisabet Metcalfe, GTO’s external affairs lead. “It helps to expand and diversify the current pool of geothermal stakeholders, building a stronger geothermal community and providing opportunities for more Americans to learn about and benefit from geothermal energy.”
One example of the need for GeoBridge arose shortly before the site was launched. A historical preservation society reached out to NREL and GTO to learn more about the potential for a closed-loop GHP to be installed in an old movie theater. The historical society’s email landed with the GeoBridge team, who had already organized relevant information as part of the content development for the site. The GeoBridge team was able to respond with detailed information on heat pump sizing and pricing, relevant incentive and assistance programs, organizations and communities, and other tools, databases, and services.
“Before GeoBridge, questions like this would get sent to multiple people, each experts in their respective fields, but it could take days to compile relevant information. Now, the answers are in one place. More importantly, the information is now easily discoverable by both people and search engines, reducing the need to send an email in the first place,” Weers said.
The current platform is just the start. The team plans to add technical guidance on advanced geothermal topics for a variety of stakeholders, resources on permitting and regulation, and links to open-access tools developed by the national laboratories, DOE, and others in the geothermal market. GeoBridge is also looking to the future of geothermal and plans to provide information on emerging trends, technology and resource needs, hurdles, funding opportunities, and more.
“We want GeoBridge to be useful to people across industries and are always looking for feedback on the platform through our

In a release shared last week, U.S.-based
The monobore geothermal system aims to simplify traditional geothermal development by eliminating the need for injection wells and leveraging a proprietary heat transfer process. Qymera’s has focused on a system that is designed to reduce drilling depth and costs, avoid fluid reinjection challenges and seismic risks, and provide reliable, small-scale geothermal baseload power for mining, manufacturing, and data centers.
CETY will contribute heat-to-power expertise, integrating its Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology into the project. One of the partner companies of CETY is Exergy ORC.
Technology & market potential
While still in early-stage demonstration, this partnership aligns with the broader trend of expanding geothermal’s role in heat-intensive industries. The agreement also includes a commercial expansion option, providing access to up to 20 MW of geothermal heat or electricity for future developments.
However, the long-term viability of monobore geothermal technology remains to be proven at scale. Unlike conventional geothermal power plants, this approach focuses on localized heat extraction, which may limit its broader application.
The pilot project will serve as a real-world test for monobore geothermal’s potential as a cost-effective, small-scale baseload energy solution. If successful, it could present a new pathway for geothermal integration in industrial power markets.

Almost EUR 90 million in investment will go towards the project, which will supported by all the partners, ADEME and the Ile-de-France Region. The concession will run for a period of 30 years. 2gré, whose teams have carried out analyses of the geothermal resources of the Dogger reservoir, will also carry out engineering and deep geothermal drilling work, with Arverne Drilling Services, as well as maintenance operations over the duration of the concession.
This major project will enable residents of both towns to benefit from local, low-carbon and competitive energy. The existing network will be completely rehabilitated, while a new network will be deployed to serve new neighborhoods. By 2031, this network will extend over 26 km, with a production capacity of 115 GWh.
Thanks to the use of 91% renewable energy, this network will reduce CO2 emissions by 20,000 tons a year, equivalent to taking 10,000 vehicles off the road. From July 1, households will benefit from a reduction of almost 50% in their energy bills. The project will help lift around 1,100 households out of fuel poverty.
“This operational collaboration with Dalkia and Ile-de-France Energies & Territoires reflects the trust placed in Arverne Group and the excellent expertise of its subsidiaries 2gré and Arverne Drilling Services,”
“By deploying our integrated and innovative offer, we are demonstrating our ability to decarbonize local heating networks thanks to geothermal energy, a local and renewable energy that reduces CO2 emissions, while offering significant savings on energy bills for individuals, local authorities and businesses
Another subsidiary of Arverne Group, Lithium de France, has been making good progress on a planned geothermal heating and lithium extraction project in the Alsace region. Through Arverne Drilling Services, the company is also working on the drilling of a geothermal doublet to supply heating to the Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport.

Corrosion and scaling significantly reduce the lifespan of traditionally used steel tubular systems, which must ensure the integrity of the wellbore. Consequently, workover procedures become necessary sooner than expected, resulting in a significant financial burden.
In contrast, Glassfiber Reinforced Epoxy (GRE) casing
![]( pipes (source: Future Pipes Industry)
The GRE-GEO project (GRE casing for geothermal applications) has developed a new strategy for well completion, aiming to provide a corrosion-resistant alternative to reduce geothermal energy development and production costs while avoiding additional investment. Moreover, GRE tubulars have a significantly lower life cycle assessment (LCA), making them a more sustainable material with low embodied CO2, which is particularly important in geothermal applications. The project was carried out by a consortium of eight partners:
* Vulcan Energie Ressourcen GmbH, Germany
* DrillTec GUT GmbH, Germany
* TU Clausthal (ITE), Germany
* Future Pipe Industries (FPI), Netherlands
* Dynaflow Research Group DRG, Netherlands
* Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group NRG, Netherlands

The findings from the study have been published as a paper, “New trilobular geometry using advanced materials for experimentally validated enhanced heat transfer in shallow geothermal applications,”Renewable Energ
“This technology constitutes today an efficient and sustainable alternative to conventional air conditioning systems,”Information Technology Research Group against Climate Change (ICTvsCC
#### The trilobular configuration
A central element of the novel BHE design is the trilobular geometry of the heat exchanger. This involved the use of three high conductivity satellite pipes which surrounds a low conductivity internal return pipe. According to the researchers’ assessment, this configuration was most promising compared to other BHE designs, including coaxial, single and double U-tubes, spiral, and helical designs.
The schematic of the trilobular design is shown below. he development, design and formulation of this new BHE configuration is currently subject to Intellectual Property Protection (IP) patent
![]( schematic of the trilobular geometry. In red are the three inlet pipes with 32 mm outer diameter, 26 mm inner diameter and high conductivity plastic. In blue the single outlet pipe, with 75 mm outer diameter, 54.4 mm inner diameter and low conductivity plastic. Dimensions in millimeters. (source: Urchueguia et al, 2024)
The main advantage of the design is its superior thermal efficiency compared to more traditional systems. This helps reduce installation and operational costs, thereby creating new opportunities for the deployment of geothermal heat pump systems, both for heating and cooling. The proposal also stands out for the use of innovative materials.
“Our work offers a more sustainable and efficient alternative in the design of heating and cooling systems,”
#### Results of thermal tests
Thermal response tests (TRT) were executed at the Geothermal Laboratory of the Universitat Politècnica de Valencia to validate the performance of the novel BHE design.
Two different trilobular BHEs were tested – one that had expanded graphite as conductive filler, and one that had graphene to improve its thermal conductivity. The performance of the trilobular BHEs were compared to two single-U heat exchanges, one of which was made with standard PE-100 material while the other was made up of advanced plastic and installed with improved grouting.

The experimental findings demonstrated that the trilobular geometry has reduced borehole resistance from value of 0.149 to 0.07 mK/W. This allows for higher injection rate without creating an unsustainable change in ground temperature.
#### A promising improvement for heating and cooling systems
The study provides some excellent insight on how the performance of geothermal heat pump systems can be improved with heat exchanger design changes and the use of innovative materials. This is particularly crucial at a time when geothermal heat pump systems are considered crucial in decarbonization efforts in cities, and have been showcased to have highly diverse applications.
“These results have important implications for the geothermal energy industry, and offer a promising energy alternative for the future of heating and cooling buildings, contributing to the fight against climate change and the promotion of renewable energies,”

![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 26 Mar 2025
An MoU has been signed for the HSGME to provide scientific advisory on the issues of geothermal energy and hydrogeology for the Visaltia Municipality in Greece.
![](

![](
![](
The Municipality of Visaltia in Greece has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the
Under the 5-year MoU, the HSGME will provide scientific assistance on the following issues:
* Energy utilization of the geothermal fluids of the Therma-Nigrita field of local interest;
* Identification and assessment of geothermal potential in the Achinos-Ivira-Mavrothalassa area; and
* The treatment of a chronic problem of ensuring good quality and sufficient quantity of drinking water for the water supply of the Communities of the Municipality.
In order to address the above issues, HSGME will provide continuous scientific information and briefing on the topics of geothermal energy and hydrogeology. Finally, in order to optimally address specific scientific and technical issues, it is envisaged to jointly establish Working Groups consisting of expert scientists from other Research Institutes and/or Higher Education Institutions (Universities).
“I would like to thank HSGME and its General Director, Mr. Dionysios Gkoutis, who responded immediately and with interest to our request and expedited the necessary procedures for the signing of the Memorandum of Cooperation / Understanding. The long-standing relationship of the former IGME with Visaltia is known to everyone, both in the field of geothermal research and in other areas of geological exploration,”Vana Pliakou.
“This long-standing and close relationship is today formalized and HSGME, as the successor of IGME, becomes an assistant and advisor to our Municipality in order to utilize the geothermal energy found in our area and to solve a chronic water supply problem. Both of these axes constitute pillars for the development of the area. The Municipal Authority is committed to this direction.”
A similar MoU had been signed earlier this year for the development of geothermal resources in the Municipality of Sintiki.
#### A strong geothermal interest in Visaltia
Dr. Apostolos Arvanitis, the Head of Geothermal Energy at HSGME, provided some details on the geothermal potential in Visaltia. “The signing of the Memorandum of Cooperation gives Visaltia a great opportunity to highlight and rationally utilize the significant geothermal potential that it seems to have.”
Apostolos Arvanitis described the Therma Nigrita geothermal field as one of the first low-enthalpy geothermal fields investigated by the IGME. The first geothermal boreholes had been drilled in this field from 1980-1982 and geothermal greenhouses had operated here in the 1990s. However, the whole project is now in a state of decline and abandonment, and the thermal baths of Therma are no longer operating.
With the MoU, development of the prospect can be revitalized. Based on the personal research of Apostolos Arvanitis, the area extending from the local community of Choumniko to the villages of Tragilos and Efkarpia is of great geothermal interest. This has been indicated by 3 geothermal wells drilled during 2000-2002 in the in the Achinos-Ivira area, identifying waters with temperatures up to 51 °C.
“Our goal is the systematic investigation of the area and its characterization as a geothermal field of local interest, in order to pave the way for the exploitation of the geothermal potential. The hydrogeological research will help, on the one hand, in solving a chronic water supply problem, and on the other hand, it will provide useful data for geothermal exploration and the possibility of implementing Geothermal Heat Pump systems,”Arvanitis.
“We want to contribute to the development of Visaltia. I hope, with everyone’s joint effort and collaboration, we can achieve this!”

“The development of deep utilization is an important step forward for the utilization of geothermal energy on a global scale, especially in areas where geothermal energy has not been exploited to date,”“The goal of the collaboration is to speed up development, promote global carbon neutrality and protect intellectual property that could be created.”
With most of the high-temperature resources in Iceland already being exploited, the project aims to tap into deeper resources that can found almost anywhere in Iceland. This can be carried out, for example, with EGS (engineered geothermal systems), which has not been used in Iceland before.
Reykjavik Energy will be providing their considerable expertise in developing heat absorption technology and leading development projects in Iceland. The project also supports the company’s strategic goal of improved resource utilization, as it is possible to use the technology in wells and resource areas that have so far not been usable.
“Deep utilization is something we have been looking at and would like to look into further, as the possibilities are great. It is therefore extremely gratifying to be able to take the next steps in this exciting project and lead the project in this country with such powerful people,”
Transition LabsClean Air Task Force
“Most of the world’s people have massive amounts of clean energy under their feet, literally. We want to promote that it is possible to use that energy to a greater extent than is currently the case and thus meet the world’s increased energy demand in a green and sustainable way,”
“What we hope with this development project in Iceland is to be able to create a roadmap to establish international test centers for deep utilization, where work would be done systematically to deal with more difficult conditions to promote the technology in different regions and thus demonstrate that deep utilization is a possible and cost-effective energy option in most of the world’s major cities,”Terra Rogers, director of deep utilization at CATF.

Aircraft engine design and manufacturing company
The planned facility will combine deep geothermal energy, heat pumps, and modernized heating networks to replace 84% of the energy needs currently supplied by gas boilers with low-carbon, local, and renewable energy. This project will also make Safran the first industrial player in the Paris region to install a deep geothermal plant.
“Through this partnership, Dalkia is demonstrating that solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in industry do exist, and that geothermal energy is one of them. I salute the commitment of Safran Aircraft Engines which, through this ambitious and innovative project, will significantly reduce the carbon footprint of its site while strengthening its energy independence. It’s an example that I’m convinced will be followed, especially since the potential is great in the Paris region,”
Wells are planned to be drilled to a depth of 1650 meters, targeting the Dogger Formation where temperatures of around 75 °C are expected. Drilling is expected to be carried out in 2025, and commissioning of the geothermal facility is targeted by late 2026. Upon operations, the heating plant will reduce carbon emissions associated with the site by 75%, equivalent to 6,500 tonnes of CO2 per year.
This pioneering project between Safran and the Dalkia-Arverne Drilling Services consortium is proof that industry can be both efficient and environmentally friendly and opens the way to new prospects for the decarbonization of industrial activities. A similar project is being undertaken by German aircraft engine manufacturer MTU Aero Engines at its Munich site, where the drilling of a geothermal doublet was completed last year.
“This project bringing together leading French industrial players demonstrates the expertise of our companies and their shared commitment to decarbonizing industry through geothermal energy,”
“We are proud that Safran Aircraft Engines has chosen our expertise to equip itself with a geothermal plant, which will provide renewable, local energy, enabling it to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. We are convinced that subsoil resources, and geothermal energy in particular, are essential levers for making a success of the energy transition and meeting the challenges of decarbonizing industry.”

Finnish geothermal company QHeat has announced that it will be offering its patented coaxial flow geothermal technology to international markets.
![](
![](
![](
Finnish geothermal energy company
QHeat’s patented geothermal heating and cooling system reduces heating emissions from buildings by up to 90%. It offers energy companies, real estate investors, owners, and construction companies the means to electrify heating with geothermal heat pumps and replace fossil fuel and combustion-based alternatives.
?
“Clean, efficient, and economically viable heating solutions are now accessible to all property and energy providers interested in future-proofing their built environment. With our licensing model we help our partners build efficient geothermal energy systems for their needs,”
“Although heat wells require an initial investment, the operating costs for the coaxial well remain low, so the investment pays for itself in the long run — through improved energy efficiency, significant financial savings and future-proofing the built environment,
The company has already played key roles in geothermal projects in Finland, notably the first geothermal heating plant in Vantaa and a subsurface heat storage facility in Salo.
#### The patented coaxial system
Salmenvaara believes coaxial geothermal energy will supersede conventional heating methods, including combustion-based heating and ground source and air-to-water source heat pumps. In 2022, QHeat started applying for patents for their technology based on coaxial flow. The patent includes an insulated pipe, with which the direction of the coaxial flow can be changed depending on the purpose of use and the entire depth of the heat well can be utilized for efficient heating and cooling.
The company’s competitive edge stems from its superior coefficient of performance (COP). Operating data shows QHeat wells achieve a COP of up to 7 for electricity usage, significantly outperforming traditional ground source and air-water source systems, which typically only reach 2.5–3.5. Not only is QHeat’s solution aligned with the EU Taxonomy and a worthwhile long-term investment, but it also enables property owners to achieve their net-zero goals while potentially becoming energy producers themselves.
“Our wells improve energy self-sufficiency; they are capable of powering entire building blocks,”
#### First licencing project underway in Estonia
QHeat projects 180 licensed heat wells across several European markets by 2027. Currently operating in Finland and Estonia, QHeat plans to expand into additional Nordic, Baltic, and Central European countries within the next five years.
In Estonia, QHeat has recently partnered with Engineering Bureau STEIGER to deliver its patented coaxial heat well for the Geological Survey of Estonia, drilling a 700-meter borehole for low-temperature district heating and cooling. This project aims to demonstrate the efficiency of low-temperature geothermal systems and marks a key step toward sustainable energy solutions in Estonia.

The United States Air Force has published the list of US companies that have been deemed “Awardable” for geothermal projects in all US Department of Defense branches and facilities worldwide. This announcement follows a solicitation that was released in late 2024.
The companies are as follows:
* Addis Energy
* Baker Hughes
* EarthBridge Energy
* Energy Systems Group / GE Vernova and partners
* GreenFire Energy
* Power Planet Inc.
* Quaise Energy
* Sage Geosystems and California Resources Corporation
* SLB
* TLS Geothermics

Following the completion of the MT survey, the company announced plans to proceed with exploration drilling in the area. Exploration at Güzelkent is part of the efforts of Ignis to unlock the geothermal energy potential of the Eastern Anatolia region.
The license area is located within the Eastern Anatolian Compressive Neotectonic Region, near the intersection of the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) and the East Anatolian Fault (EAF). Previous studies in the region have identified five major Paleotectonic blocks, three of which are present around the study area.
This development follows the company’s recent success at the Kaynarp?nar Exploitation Lease, where it established artesian flow at commercially viable temperatures, marking a key milestone in its geothermal energy initiatives.

The exploration campaigns took place within the perimeters of the Exclusive Research Permits “Les Poteries” and “Strasbourg” held by its sister company
With a total cumulative surface area of ??310 square kilometers explored in just over 2 years, and an investment of more than 12 million euros, Lithium de France confirms its position as the first French independent geothermal heat and lithium operator to have explored such a large surface area in Northern Alsace.
“Arverne Group stands out for its unique expertise in geosciences and its mastery of exploration and drilling operations that meet the strictest standards in the industry,”
“These 3D exploration campaigns are essential to better understand the subsoil and its constraints. They allow us to develop, in complete safety, our heat projects – which will benefit the territory in a short circuit – and geothermal lithium – a strategic sovereign resource, crucial for the energy transition.”
In 2023, Lithium de France announced the closing of a EUR 44 million Series B funding round.
Lithium de France has published a video summarizing the exploration work that they have done thus far, as shown below:

The Caribbean island nation of Dominica has made significant strides in the past years towards the development of its first geothermal power project. Drilling and testing of the production and reinjection wells have already been completed, and more recent updates indicate that site preparation has been ongoing for the power plant construction that is expected to start by early 2025.
The 10-MW geothermal power project is set to make a huge impact in the costs and reliability of electricity supply in Dominica. Currently, Dominica imports over 90% of its energy, mainly in the form of fossil fuels. Approximately 70% of the country’s electricity is diesel-generated, driving up energy costs and hindering business growth and progress towards key Sustainable Development Goals. Early studies suggest that the island’s geothermal potential could provide electrical power capacity up to 50-times the current peak demand of approximately 18 MW.
The Government of Dominica has also engaged with a company from Trinidad and Tobago to undertake a pre-feasibility study for the production of green ammonia using geothermal energy.
“This plant will go a long way in helping Dominica achieve its sustainable energy goals and transition from fossil fuel-based electricity generation to entirely renewable sources,”
#### Supporting energy security in the Caribbean region
This project is funded under
CDB’s funding – with resources from the Inter-American Development Bank (through the Green Climate Fund), and Government of Canada through the Global Affairs Canada – covers 51% of the total project costs of approximately USD68 million, with the CARICOM Development Fund (CDF) contributing 22%, and the remainder as equity from the GPC.
Mr Joseph Williams, Coordinator of the CDB’s Sustainable Energy Unit, noted that the approved funding for Dominica represents an important milestone and highlighted the importance of development financing in geothermal projects in small island developing states, given the high risk and national governments’ fiscal and human capacity constraints.
In addition to Dominica, other OECS nations have received support under the GeoSmart Initiative. A USD9.4 million grant has been approved for test drilling in Grenada, while St Kitts and Nevis received USD 17 million in funding towards the drilling of production wells on the island of Nevis. CDB previously provided USD27 million to support completed geothermal exploration in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.
Tapping the geothermal potential of the OECS countries helps strengthen the energy security of the region by reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels, while also reducing carbon emissions and contributing to global efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change. It also helps increase the competitiveness of these economies by supplying affordable and reliable electricity to consumers, households, and businesses.

Repsol was one of six companies that were awarded geothermal exploration blocks covering the southern half of La Palma following a tender by the Department of Ecological Transition and Energy of the Government of the Canary Islands.
The proposal of Repsol for geothermal exploration involved investigation in 16 municipalities including Fuencaliente, Villa de Mazo, Breña Baja, and Breña Alta. The company had planned to spend EUR 34 million on the project and was set to receive around EUR 4 million of aid from the
Earlier in 2024, it was also reported that both Repsol and Unelco had withdrawn their research permits for geothermal exploration in Tenerife.
Mariano Hernandez Zapata, Minister of Ecological Transition and Energy, said that he is not concerned about Repsol withdrawing from the project, as the blocks awarded to the company will be assigned to other beneficiaries. The Minister also said that in cases where the execution period for subsidies is too short, he trusts in the “good work of the Commissioner so that there extensions and deadlines can be extended.”
The head of the Canary Island energy portfolio however expressed hopes that the funding for geothermal exploration allocated by the IDAE to Repsol can instead be distributed to other contractors.

On 19-20 November 2024, the EU-funded project (“Geothermal Synergy: enhancing industrial energy efficiency through steam high-temperature heat pumps and heat-powered cooling systems with operational flexibility and public trust”) officially began with a productive and inspiring kick-off meeting in the Toscana region in Italy.
The GEOSYN is a Horizon Europe project coordinated by
The meeting brought together a diverse and talented consortium of 10 partners from 5 European countries – Italy (APRE, UNIFI, COSVIG, RIVACOLD, FORMAGGERIA TOSCANA S.R.L.), Norway (SINTEF AS, SINTEF Energi AS), Denmark (University of Southern Denmark), Ukraine (Geothermal Ukraine), and France (NEO-ECO) to set the stage for the project’s ambitious goals.
#### Project objectives and expected outcome
GEOSYN aims to validate a groundbreaking geothermal steam heat pump coupled with heat-powered refrigeration systems for industrial applications, specifically for the cascading use of heat from deep or shallow rock formations. The solution prioritises environmental sustainability, using water as the working fluid in all sub-systems and anticipates improvements in cost-efficiency for geothermal application developments.
The expected outcome is a substantial increase in the deployment of geothermal resources for heat and cold generation, offering enhanced efficiency, less environmental hazards, portability and more societal acceptance. Additionally, the solution seeks to enable the use of geothermal energy sources in regions with or without significant hydrothermal reservoirs, seamlessly integrated with the industrial setting and showcasing adaptability for widespread use. Furthermore, the solution is planned to be integrated with additional renewable energy sources to improve grid stability and power supply dependability, making it suitable for a variety of geological structural conditions, including district heating networks.
By integrating with thermal energy storage systems, the GEOSYN technology will increase adaptability and operate with a variety of thermal sources, such as waste heat and geothermal sources at varying temperatures. A demonstration campaign will be held in a dairy facility in Italy to showcase and validate the results of the GEOSYN project, and virtual case studies (such as low carbon cement plant in Ukraine) will be assessed to demonstrate the solution’s applicability.
The deployment of the GEOSYN innovation will be supported by awareness-raising and social acceptance campaigns to enhance engagement with civil society. The GEOSYN will engage with policy makers to incorporate the geothermal deployment in local, regional and national policies. Additionally, GEOSYN will inspire young women through the use of female role models to study and take up careers in entrepreneurship and geothermal H&C. Finally, environmental and financial benefit examples of the proposed technology in diverse contexts will demonstrate the affordability of geothermal H&C for production processes.

A geothermal energy development project in the Northwest Territories, Canada, is set to receive $2 million in funding through the
The funding announcement was made by Michael McLeod, Member of Parliament for Northwest Territories.
“It’s great to see innovative projects come to life that will contribute to reducing diesel use and bringing health and economic benefits to communities. It’s another step in the Government of Canada’s commitment to supporting reconciliation, further recognizing Indigenous communities’ expertise in addressing climate change and protecting the environment,”
The project aims to engage the community of Echaot’l Koe (Fort Liard) and support Acho Dene Koe First Nation in determining strategies to develop the geothermal resources within the territory of the First Nation in the Northwest Territories. It also involves identifying specific opportunities for geothermal resource development.
Developing geothermal resources aims to support the transition of the Indigenous communities to renewable energy, thus reducing dependence on diesel fuel for heating, as well as creating jobs and boosting economic development in the Fort Liard region.
“The ADK Geothermal Development project will make a real difference in the lives of people living in the Northwest Territories while also driving down climate-changing emissions. Indigenous communities deserve to have access to the resources they need to advance clean energy solutions in their home territories — and that is exactly what the Government of Canada is supporting through this project,”
#### About the CERRC
Launched in 2018, the CERRC program has allocated $220 million over eight years to reduce diesel reliance for heat and power in Indigenous and remote communities. CERRC received an additional $233 million over five years through Budget 2021.
CERRC provides funding for renewable energy and capacity building projects to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels for heating and electricity in Indigenous, rural and remote communities across Canada to create warmer, healthier homes and provide savings to communities. The program has supported 111 projects nationally, including capacity building initiatives, large capital projects, innovation projects and bioheat projects.

Indonesian geothermal power developer and operator
According to BREN Corporate Secretary Merly, Kyndryl Bridge, an AI-power open integration platform, will improve the IT operation of Star Energy through advanced automations and AI operations (AIOps). It uses AI and machine learning to provide real-time insights on system performance and provide proactive solutions, thus increasing system reliability by predicting failures before they occur.
The solution will also automate various IT tasks, simplify workflows, and allow IT team to focus on strategic initiatives rather than spend time doing routine maintenance.
#### Migration to cloud technology
Kyndryl will be migrating the IT workloads at the operational sites of BREN to Microsoft Azure Cloud. “This transition to the cloud not only reduces operational costs, but also increases agility and scalability, so that BREN’s geothermal unit can respond to any changes in business needs quickly, while up or down its cloud to adapt to technological advances, market dynamics, and evolving cyber regulations,”
Kyndryl has also helped upgrade the communication system of Star Energy, making it more scalable and agile. This is a key improvement aimed at strengthening communication and collaboration within the company.
“Cloud technology makes us more agile, better connected, and technologically agile when dealing with the ever-evolving demands and preferences in the energy market. It will also drive innovation, efficiency, and is critical in optimizing operations, reducing costs, and supporting our transition to renewable energy ,”
Efendi Azmi Hashim, Managing Director for Kyndryl Malaysia and Indonesia, commended BREN for taking a step forward towards meeting changing business needs and keeping at par with the global energy sector with the use of artificial intelligence and the latest in cloud technology.

The US House of Representatives has approved two bills that seek to accelerate geothermal development by removing red tape and increasing lease opportunities.

Two major proposed bills that seek to accelerate the development of geothermal projects in the United States have recently been approved by the House of Representatives. The two bills referred to here are the Harnessing Energy At Thermal Sources (HEATS) Act (H.R. 7409) and the Committing Leases for Energy Access Now (CLEAN) Act. (H.R 1449), both bipartisan in nature.
Both bills will soon be deliberated by the Senate. Several efforts to craft a pro-geothermal legislative framework are currently ongoing in parallel in the US, both in the federal and state levels.
#### The HEATS Act
The HEATS Act is is sponsored by Rep. Young Kim (R-CA-40) and supported by Rep. John Duarte (R-CA-13). The bill aims to expedite geothermal development by clarifying that geothermal operators do not need a federal drilling permit for wells that are on state and private land given that the subsurface geothermal estate is less than 50% federal.
“Operators must still go through a rigorous permitting process at the state level, but they will no longer be burdened by the federal process, allowing us to harness this untapped energy source faster,”
The bill also states that such geothermal exploration and production activity is not considered a major federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and should not trigger the NEPA’s environmental review requirements.
Moreover, the bill exempts geothermal activities from the consultation requirements under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and review requirements under the National Historic Preservation Act unless the state in which the activity occurs does not have a state law that addresses the preservation of historic properties.
#### The CLEAN Act
The CLEAN Act by Rep. Russ Fulcher (R-ID-1) amends the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 to requite the Department of the Interior to hold geothermal lease sales every years, instead of the current two-year interval. Moreover, it requires the department to hold a replacement lease sale within the year should one be canceled.
In addition, this bill requires Interior to notify an applicant whether or not its application for a geothermal drilling permit is complete within 30 days of receiving the application. If Interior determines that the application is complete, then it must issue a final decision on the application within 30 days of the date Interior sent the notification.
“As nearly 90% of our nation’s geothermal resources are located on federally managed lands, I introduced the CLEAN Act to remove red tape and require the Department of Interior to increase lease opportunities to bolster the exploration and development of this critical resource,”
“This legislation is not only vital to reducing our reliance on foreign adversaries but meeting America’s growing energy demands. I am very pleased to see it head to the Senate.”

The first phase of the Latitude 53 project aims to support year-round cultivation of strawberries across a 20-acre greenhouse using approximately 50 GJ of geothermal heat per hour. The second phase then aims to generate 10 MW installed capacity of geothermal power.
A crucial element for the project is E2E’s patented Enhanced Geothermal Reservoir Recovery System (EGRRS), essentially a combination of conventional and EGS technologies. More information on this novel geothermal system is provided in a previous news piece on a pilot project in Rainbow Lake.
The Latitude 53 project, which we first reported on back in 2022, is expected to foster economic growth and employment opportunities in Hinton and the West Yellowhead region. The project has received Government of Canada funding and will be supported by Ormat Technologies.
“We are looking forward to introducing this innovative approach to thermal and electrical generation to Alberta,” “Our partnership with E2E Energy Solutions perfectly aligns with our mission to leverage advanced geothermal technology for sustainable, community-centered projects.”
“We’re very pleased to see our EGRRS technology integrated into a project that will bring stable, affordable energy to Alberta,”

Enerdrape has partnered with CIEC to deploy their geothermal panel technology in Paris, France that turns underground structures to geothermal energy sources.
![](
![](
![](
Swiss startup
Enerdrape has developed the technology for pre-fabricated geothermal panels that can turn underground structures, such as garages or tunnels, into renewable sources of thermal energy for heat and cooling without drilling. The panels are modular, thin, flexible, made of recyclable materials, and compatible with heat pumps. In early 2024, the startup successfully closed a CHF 1.3 million seed funding round.
The first project under this partnership will target the installation of about 130 Enerdrape geothermal panels in the 11th arrondissement of Paris. This will be the equivalent of about 23 kW of thermal power, or an output of 40 MWh per year.
To learn more about the technology of Enerdrape, check out this interview with company found Margaux Peltier that was recorded at the 2024 GeoTHERM expo in Offenburg, Germany.

Geothermal developer 400C Energy has acquired the rights for a site in Salt Cove, Utah to develop a 100-MWe geothermal project using EGS technology.
![](
![](
![](
400C will develop this hot, dry resource offset of the Department of Energy FORGE project and Blundell Geothermal Power Plant to produce carbon-free, 24/7 dispatchable electricity at an LCOE comparable to solar. This outlier LCOE is achievable with a proprietary hydraulic stimulation technology that provides a step-change increase in downhole surface area and deployable temperatures while increasing powerplant life by using flow conformance inherent in the tech.
400C, with industry partners, will also deploy a variety of commercial technologies from the oil and gas industry including extended reach drilling, mud-cooling, high temperature directional drilling equipment, high performance casing connections, dissolvable metals as well as electric high-spec drilling rigs and frac pumpers ran on grid connected power.
“Tech-enabled enhanced geothermal power is vital to achieving grid resilience and affordable energy abundance. We will develop this 275o
“We will also allow our wells to be used as a sandbox for emerging technology providers including high temperature surveying and novel insulated drill pipe as a means to increase technology readiness for longer horizontals in harder and hotter rocks”.
#### Sandbox Program
400C is announcing its inaugural Sandbox Program where emerging well construction technology providers will be provided an opportunity to increase their TRL levels in high temperature well on the Salt Cove project. All interested parties should indicate their interest at
* High temperature wellbore surveying and directional drilling equipment
* Mud cooling and insulated drill pipe

Turkish group Soyak received a permit to develop a geothermal power project in Croatia, as reported in Türkiye just before year-end.
The Soyak Group operates two geothermal power plants in Turkey through its subsidiary Mis Enerji Üretim A.S.:
* Mis-1 Geothermal Power Plant with a capacity of 12.3 MW in Alasehir, Manisa.
* Mis-3 Geothermal Power Plant with a capacity of 48 MW, also in Alasehir, Manisa
* and has additional development interest in the country.
The permit has been issued by the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development and will be valid for 25 years for the development of a 98 MWe geothermal power plant, with an option to expand by 4% at a later stage. The company has been seeking this permit for four years through its subsidiary Terra Enerji, since 2020.
![](
The Legrad 1 geothermal project has been granted an exploitation
The signing will take place on February 4 at a ceremony attended by the Croatian Minister of Economy. Terra Enerji will pay EUR 3,981 ($4,148) for each square kilometer of land. To this figure will be added 5.67 percent of the market value of electricity generated by geothermal energy. In addition, a payment of EUR 225,000 will be made to compensate for any possible damages caused by the plant to be built in the region.

As global energy demand rises, geothermal energy is gaining attention as a reliable and sustainable solution. However, despite its advantages, the geothermal sector struggles with public awareness and perception. A report, developed through industry collaboration and presented at a workshop at the
#### The need for a clear and unified message
Geothermal has long been recognized for its potential to provide stable, 24/7 renewable power, yet public understanding remains limited. Industry leaders, including Baseload Capital, Geothermal Rising, the International Geothermal Association, ThinkGeoEnergy, and Ormat Technologies, have worked together to create the Declaration of Communication—a guide to improving how the industry presents itself to investors, policymakers, and the public.
The document, built on insights gathered from global workshops and discussions, emphasizes:
* Simplified storytelling to make geothermal more accessible.
* Visual communication to enhance understanding.
* Stronger collaboration across industries and energy sectors.
#### Geothermal’s role in the energy transition
The need for secure, clean, and reliable baseload power has never been greater, especially as electricity demand soars due to AI, data centers, and electrification. The geothermal sector must learn from other renewables—such as solar energy’s success in reshaping public perception—and apply similar strategies to accelerate adoption.
The Declaration of Communication serves as a foundation for these efforts, encouraging stakeholders to unite around a shared message and drive greater recognition of geothermal’s value.
#### A Call to Action: building a stronger geothermal future
By signing the Declaration of Communication, industry leaders, advocates, and stakeholders can help amplify the message and ensure geothermal remains a strong player in the global energy transition.
With a more cohesive and strategic approach to communication, geothermal can take its rightful place as a key pillar of the clean energy future.

Earlier this month, French geothermal group, Arverne announced that its subsidiary Lithium de France has signed a framework agreement with SLB to acquire wellheads for its geothermal heat and Lithium project in Alsace, France.
An initial order has been placed for equipment to be manufactured in Europe and delivered in Alsace ahead of the start of the drilling campaign.
The geothermal heat and lithium project led by Arverne Group and Lithium de France, in Alsace, plans to reach, in 2031, an annual production capacity of 27,000 tons lithium carbonate and 2.2 TWh of geothermal heat. The heat produced will benefit businesses, farmers and local authorities in the Alsace region through a localized supply chain. The low carbon geothermal lithium will be dedicated to supply batteries for electric vehicles produced in France.
“Our teams are particularly thrilled to work together, with the same innovation DNA to accelerate decarbonization and the same roots, as SLB and Lithium de France have both their origin in the Alsace region, around Pechelbronn, in 1926 and 2020. Our geothermal heat and lithium project paves the way for reliable energy thanks to science, engineering and know-how developed by committed people.” Said Pierre Brossollet, founder and Chairman & CEO at Arverne Group, mission-driven company listed on the Tech Leaders segment of Euronext Paris.

The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process has been initiated for a planned geothermal exploration drilling campaign by SANJES Enerji Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. (SANJES Enerji) in the Salihli district of Manisa, Türkiye. The plan will be to drill 9 geothermal resource wells for a 35,000 square-meter greenhouse project.
The first license for the region was obtained by Aytemiz Elektrik Üretim A.S. in 2010, and in 2023, it was acquired by
The 9 geothermal drilling wells planned by SANJES Enerji are expected to contain high-temperature geothermal fluid. As part of the project, each well will be drilled up to a depth of 2,500 (+500) meters. According to official estimates, geothermal fluid with a temperature of 200°C at the bottom of the well and 130-150°C at the surface is expected to be obtained. Additionally, the fluid capacity is projected to be between 150-200 tons per hour.
The investment is planned to be implemented with a total budget of 95 million TL (approx. USD 2.65 million), with 79.5 million TL allocated for drilling activities and 15.5 million TL for greenhouse installation.
SANJES Enerji currently operates three geothermal power plants in the Salihli-Manisa region with a total installed capacity of 70 MW. In 2024, the company announced plans of increasing the capacity of an existing power plant, as well as for the construction of a new 80-MW geothermal power plant.

#### Geothermal beyond Paris
As of 2023, France has 80 deep geothermal plants producing 2 TWh of heat. Most of these operations are taking place in the Paris Basin and in the Aquitaine Basin, with none in southeastern France, despite its potential geothermal resources and the demand for decarbonized heat for both residential heating networks and industry use.
Therefore, to foster the development of deep geothermal project in southeastern France, an exploration campaign was started targeting approximately 1000 km2
The area is well known for its lignite resources and has also been explored, without success, for oil and gas (exploration wells and seismic data shot before 1980). Despite the geoscientific data available, significant uncertainties remain regarding the existence and characteristics of a deep geothermal resource. The main unknowns include the geometry and depth of the target reservoirs (carbonates from the lower cretaceous), properties of the reservoirs and characteristics of the water resource (presence, recharge dynamics and exit mechanism).
#### A comprehensive exploration program
To help assess these elements and uncertainties a comprehensive exploration program was drafted and is currently being executed.

It started with the acquisition in autumn 2024 of over 320 km of modern broadband 2D reflection seismic data on land and on the Etang de Berre to complement the legacy and help with the construction of structural model of the zone of interest. This geophysical campaign – financed by public funds – is referenced in the article of “
To complement the geophysics, geological field work to collect structural information and rock samples from analogues as well as a study of the karstification is being undertaken now. The collected data will help with understanding of the reservoir properties and possible fluid flow circulation at depth. The construction of a geological model integrating all the data will take place by the end of the year with an expected end of the project and result delivery to the public, authorities and industry by mid 2026.

![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 28 Aug 2024
Studies done by GNS Science show that co-injecting CO2 with geothermal brine mitigates silica scaling while making geothermal power generation CO2-neutral.

Lab-scale tests done by New Zealand-based research institute
Under current practices in most parts of the world, geothermal power stations emit naturally occurring CO2 that is initially dissolved in the geothermal fluid as part of the power generation process. Although a minuscule amount, the CO2 emitted means that geothermal electricity generation is not completely free from carbon emissions and the cost of carbon tax.
There are already several efforts worldwide to re-inject this CO2 into the geothermal reservoir. This has the potential to turn geothermal generators from CO2 emitters to CO2 neutral. A notable example of this is the Ngawha Geothermal Power Station by Top Energy, also in New Zealand, which has achieved 100% reinjection of non-condensible gases as part of the Ngawha Carbon Zero Project. However, there is still a knowledge gap on how a geothermal reservoir would respond to long-term CO2 re-injection.
#### Results of lab tests
Tests were done using the novel dual-stage autoclave method by GNS Science. Aside from the goal of re-injecting CO2, the theory is that CO2 forms carbonic acid upon dissolution in the fluid. This makes the brine more acidic and helps prevent silica scaling in the reservoir. Scaling in the formation is a particularly big problem in re-injection wells, as it may reduce injectivity and eventually necessitate the drilling of new wells.
The experiment was done using greywacke, a major reservoir rock type found in the Taupo Volcanic Zone. The control experiment showed that moderate silica scaling occurs with standard geothermal brine, and that this scaling is enhanced with the introduction of calcite. However, using brine charged with 2000 mg of CO2/kg brine resulted in nearly zero scaling.
#### CO2 as a natural cleaning agent
The test results showed that the accelerated removal of calcite from the rock is an important side-effect of co-injection CO2 with geothermal brine. As a “win-win-win” solution, the co-injection of captured CO2 with the geothermal brine can:
* lower the emissions, therefore the carbon tax, for geothermal operators
* make the expended geothermal brine that flows into the subsurface retain its acidity, which slows silica scaling in the rock
* at high concentrations, accelerate the removal of calcite from the rock, meaning that the CO2 is acting as a “cleaning agent” because it removes the cause of silica scaling.
Co-injection can thus eliminate carbon emissions while improving the efficiency of production operations and the sustainability of the geothermal reservoir.
#### Next steps
Site-specific studies were funded by both domestic and international geothermal operators, and have led to the formulation of the novel concept of CO2 as a silica anti-scalant. The research done by GNS Science was supported by the Strategic Science Investment Fund (SSIF) Programmes Contract C05X1702 granted by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE).
Encouraged by the promising results, two New Zealand geothermal power generators have requested further experimentation. The goal is to further explore the effects of CO2 co-injection, potentially leading to more efficient and sustainable geothermal power production.

The expected cost of the drilling is about PLN 23.7 million (USD 5.8 million). The funding will cover PLN 18.8 million of the cost, with the rest to be financed by the city.
Marcin Rylko, spokesman for the Jelenia Góra City Hall, explained that the presence of a geothermal resource, mainly under Cieplice and Sobieszów, had already been confirmed by previous studies. The future exploration borehole will be drilled to a depth of about 2500 meters. After a detailed hydrogeological evaluation, the city will decide on the possible use of the thermal waters and will apply for a concession for possible exploitation.
The area of Cieplice is well-known for the Bad Warmburnn hot springs, which had already been an attraction since the 13th century.
Just recently, the NFOSiGW announced a new round of funding allocations for geothermal heating exploration in ten communes in Poland. This follows up on several funding announcements made through recent years to support the development of geothermal resources for heating in the country.

The city of Kalisz in Poland is expecting to commence exploratory drilling for geothermal resources by the first quarter of 2025. In the future, thermal water from the project may supply nearby recreational facilities and provide heating for municipal and residential buildings.
The positive development comes after the signing of funding agreements with the
The planned exploratory well in Kalisz will be a vertical borehole, located between Sportowa Street, Wal Jagiellonski, and the Swedrnia River, and drilled to a depth of 1700 meters. A number of hydrogeological, geophysical, and laboratory tests will be done after drilling, and full hydrogeological documentation is expected by 2026.
Experts believe that the geothermal resource in Kalisz is hotter than those of nearby Uniejow and Poddebice, where geothermal heating facilities have been successfuly operating for years.
“Geothermal energy is primarily cheap energy, cheap heating for Kalisz residents’ homes. This applies to both existing buildings and those that will be built,”

After a few hours of discussion, the city council of Ludwigshafen in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany voted unanimously in favor of exploration activities related to a geothermal heat and lithium extraction project. This is a project that will be implemented by an agreement signed in late 2024.
Mayor Jutta Steinruck expressed relief for the favorable vote, but also emphasized that information on the project must be provided to the public. “The questions from citizens show that it is something new, something unknown. We have to react to it.”
The two partners plan to jointly develop a geothermal heat project to supply BASF’s Verbund site, as well as to evaluate the feasibility of constructing a lithium extraction plant within the BASF site to produce lithium from geothermal brine. As a preparatory step, a seismic survey will be done to identify the possible reservoir for the geothermal resource. Vulcan estimates that the comprehensive investigations will cost a total of EUR 10-15 million.
Some members of the city council criticized the short-term scheduling of the exploration activities, stating that there had been no time beforehand for the group to discuss the topic of geothermal energy. However, the decision had to be made as seismic measurements would no longer be possible during the birds’ breeding season in spring.
According to the initial project timeline published by the project partners, the upcoming activities will involve a 2D seismic survey. This can then be followed up by 3D seismic surveys in the 2025/2026 winter season to identify well site locations.

The first phase of a USD 220 million geothermal heating project in the
Construction work for the project started in 2022, and is expected to continue until 2028. After completion of the Phase 1 for the North Campus, the next phases will cover the Quad District and the Central District.
An invisible system
Gary Hartwell, project manager in Facilities Management, notes how most of the infrastructure for the geothermal heating system is invisible. The top of the geo-exchange pipe is buried four feet below the ground and is connected to the borehole field.
The location of the borehole field, on the Davis Meadow, now has a restored landscape with native vegetation and outdoor social spaces. The space serves to increase biodiversity and the local plant species supplies food for wildlife and provides carbon sequestration.
A model for other colleges
Smith is the first college in the region to implement a geothermal heating project. Thus, it is being viewed as a model by other colleges, K-12 schools, and municipalities.
“Our work was highlighted by the United Nations Framework on Climate Change as innovators in the Race to Zero Emissions, alongside campuses from around the globe,
“And closer to home, we’ve been able to share our knowledge with our neighbors in Hadley, as well as with MIT and Vassar College, where they are considering a switch to geothermal energy.”
Charlie Conant, interim assistant vice president of capital projects, also points out that the college had undergone a similar transformation back in 1946 when it phased out coal-fired boilers in most of the major buildings in the campus. “It’s a generational change, this kind of conversion,”

PT Supreme Energy Muara Laboh has signed a PPA Amendment for the development of the 140-MW expansion of the Muara Laboh geothermal power plant in Indonesia.
![](
![](
![](
With the issuance of tariff adjustment approval from the started operations in December 2019.
The additional capacity from Units 2 and 3 will provide electricity to 760,000 households connected to the Sumatra grid. It will also increase the contribution from renewables to Indonesia’s energy mix, thus reducing emissions by about 900,000 tons of CO2 per year. The construction phase of the power plants is also expected to provide jobs to around 1500 people, thus boosting the local and regional economy with employment opportunities and, eventually, royalty and production bonus payments to the local governments.
PT SEML is a joint venture between PT Supreme Energy Sumatera, Sumitomo Corporation, and INPEX Geothermal Ltd.
“The development of Units 2 and 3 of the Muara Laboh Geothermal Power Plant, that requires the investment of USD 900 million, demonstrates the strong commitment of Supreme Energy and its international partners to advancing geothermal energy in Indonesia. This is in line with the Indonesian Government’s energy mix target from renewables as well as the target for net zero emission by 2060. We deeply value the ongoing support from the Government, PLN, and the Solok Selatan community,”
In addition to Muara Laboh Geothermal Power Plant, PT Supreme Energy had developed the Rantau Dedap Geothermal Power Plant in South Sumatra with a capacity of 91.2 MW, which achieved COD on December 26, 2021. This project is developed and operated by PT Supreme Energy Rantau Dedap (SERD), a joint venture involving PT Supreme Energy Sriwijaya, Marubeni Corporation, Tohoku Electric, INPEX Geothermal Ltd., and PT Energia Prima Nusantara (PAMA/UT).
Through PT Supreme Energy Rajabasa (SERB), a joint venture between PT Supreme Energy Lampung with Sumitomo Corporation and INPEX Geothermal Ltd., the company is also preparing exploration activities for the Rajabasa Geothermal Working Area in Lampung Selatan Regency, Lampung Province. Exploration will begin upon completion of the PPA extension with PT PLN (Persero).

Fervo Energy’s IPO ambitions highlight geothermal’s growth potential, but past public market cycles and evolving business models provide key lessons.
![](
![](
![](
Fervo Energy’s potential IPO and multi-billion-dollar valuation discussions mark a pivotal moment for geothermal energy investment. In news shared by
If one looks at this news, I wanted to share my key observations and an analysis of the broader implications for the sector:
1. Venture capital & technology-driven investment
In a unique financing mix, Fervo Energy’s stands out with venture capital investors such as Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC and Congruent Ventures, institutional investments through e.g. CPP Investmenbts and CalSTRS, but – and importantly – strategic backing from oil & gas through Devon Energy and Liberty Energy (the latter investing under now U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, then CEO of Liberty Energy).
With having secured USD 556 milllion in equity financing and USD 220 million in debt financing, the company is clearly positioned itself as a leader in next-generation geothermal. What makes Fervo particularly interesting in this context is here the focus on utilizing Enhanced/ Engineered Geothermal Systems (EGS) technology tapping learnings from the oil & gas sector, pairing it with traditional utility-drive geothermal development on scale and – building partnerships with power offtakers right from the beginning, ensuring revenue stability before development.
2. Large-scale project development & demand growth
From its initial pilot-scale project, a 3 MW project in Nevada to the now full-scale commercial development in Nevada and Utah.
The 115 MW geothermal project in Nevada is part of a partnership with utility NV Energy to supply power to Google‘s data centers in the state, specifically in Hendersen (near Las Vegas) and Storey County (east of Reno, Nevada).
The larger project in Utah, known as Cape Station in Beaver County, Utah northeast of Milford is set up as a 400 MW project being developed in stages with the 100 MW Phase 1 planned to deliver power as early as 2026, and the remaining 300 MW Phase 2 to then be operational by 2028.
The rapid growth of U.S. data centers has fueled demand for clean, firm power, and Fervo has been instrumental in positioning geothermal as a key solution. We recently published an article on the expected power demand and the potential role for geothermal referring to a report released by Rhodium Group.
3. The U.S. Market & Policy Landscape
Maybe surprisingly, geothermal has received unexpected support from the Trump administration, particularly through the energy “article on a recent geothermal event by ProjectInnerspace and CRES in Washington, there are risks.
The control by the Republican Party of the Congress in Washington poses risks to clean energy tax credits from the 2022 climate law (
4. Business model uncertainty: portfolio development vs. hidden champions
Unlike wind and solar, geothermal continues to lack a dominant project development model. Fervo Energy – to the best of my understanding – seems to balance scaling as a technology-driven power developer paired with large-scale development. How and if it will expand into a portfolio expansion model will have to be seen. The questions is also if EGS proves viable across different geologies, ensuring replicability at scale. For now it seems EGS can expand geothermal development beyond the geographically limited conventional hydrothermal resources.
While scaling geothermal technology is essential, the business model for large-scale, multi-project development remains unclear. Will a “hidden champion” model emerge – where companies focus on specific high-value markets, such as heating, industrial applications rather than widespread portfolio growth?
5. Lessons from past geothermal public listings
The now planned IPO by Fervo Energy draws comparision to past geothermal listings on global stock markets, many of which struggled to scale – and mostly do not exist anymore.
Historical Public Market Trends:
* Australia (ASX, 2005–2015) – Geodynamics, PetraTherm and others pursued EGS but faced high costs, technical hurdles and lack of support by the Australian government. Here an interesting article by
* Canada (TSX, 2005–2015) – Magma Energy (later Alterra Power), Ram Power, Nevada Geothermal Power, Sierra Geothermal Power, Western GeoPower – all failed to establish scalable und sustainable models. An
So what is different now? There is capital backing from both venture and institutional investors, a surging demand from AI and data centers, and EGS technology has matured with the expertise gained by the oil & gas sector.
6. Europe’s geothermal heating boom: a different investment model
While seemingly, most of the companies making the news on technology development for geothermal and investments are U.S. based, there are European players with long-term perspectives. Unlike the U.S. power-focused model, Europe is prioritizing district heating, both due to decarbonization efforts but also a strong push for energy security following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, with European countries trying to curb their dependency on imported Russian gas.
There are a large number of companies pushing geothermal development for heating in Europe, Eavor Technologies – a Canadian player – is developing heat (and power) projects parallel to commercially prove their closed-loop technology, oil company OMV with heat development in Austria and investor in Eavor. Interesting in the context of Fervo and its plans, are though
Why does this European focus on heating matter?
Development of heating projects can be seen as lower risk and potentially faster payback then technologically complex deep geothermap projects, as it targets shallower and lower temperatore resources broadening the geographic opportunities of geothermal deployment. There is large regulatory and municipal support (and demand) for clean heating projects with limited alternatives to geothermal energy. Furthermore the market structure with district heating networks, and ambitious large-scale plans to expand these networks, provide stable revenue streams with long-term utility contracts.
As geothermal investment expands beyond power, Fervo’s U.S. focus may contrast with Europe’s heating-driven strategy, opening opportunities for divergent business models.
Final thoughts: What this means for the future of geothermal
The indication of an IPO by Fervo Energy signals that venture capital (and institutional investment) sees real potential in scaling geothermal. There are though some challenges remaining, such as proving scalability across diverse geologies, navigating uncertain policy & tax incentives, long project development time frames, and – crucial – defining a sustainable business model – pure developer vs. integrated energy player.
If geothermal can achieve both technological breakthroughs and financial scale, Fervo’s IPO could mark a turning point for geothermal energy as a firm, clean energy solution – particularly as U.S. data center energy demand skyrockets.

As reported by our German partners at TiefeGeothermie.de, the Ostvogtland geothermal project, located in the Vogtland district of Saxony, that aims at the utilization of geothermal energy for regional heating solutions has started exploration efforts. This initiative aligns with Germany’s broader efforts to transition to renewable heating and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
The exploration phase, now underway, includes geological surveys and preliminary drilling to assess the underground conditions for geothermal heat extraction. Experts will evaluate the thermal and structural properties of the subsurface to determine the feasibility of deep geothermal utilization. Following the exploration phase, detailed analysis will guide the project’s next steps, including drilling and infrastructure planning. If successful, the geothermal plant could significantly contribute to the region’s heating supply, supporting both residential and industrial needs.
The project is backed by two experienced geothermal energy firms from France: TLS Geothermics and Kalyosphere. The kickoff event saw key figures from the industry participating in the ceremonial groundbreaking, including Sébastien Delannoy from TLS Geothermics and Gitta Wahl from Bestec, the company responsible for coordinating the geological surveys.
According to Mathieu Auxietre, CEO of TLS Geothermics, investing in this technology is not only about reducing CO? emissions but also about strengthening energy security, fostering economic growth, and creating local jobs. Nicolas Dall’asta, a geologist at TLS Geothermics, highlighted Saxony’s promising geological conditions for geothermal energy, emphasizing that initial studies indicate strong potential in the Auerbach region.
Alain Rabaute, geologist at Kalyosphere, explained that state-of-the-art geophysical and geological survey techniques are being used to evaluate underground conditions, all while adhering to the highest environmental and safety standards.
The exploration area spans nearly 850 square kilometers, covering parts of the Vogtlandkreis, Erzgebirgskreis, and the Zwickau district. Over 250 measurement points have been designated for geophysical studies. Special sensors, embedded 30 centimeters into the ground, will collect data over the next one to two months to analyze geological structures. These non-intrusive “silent measurements” assess natural ground vibrations as well as electrical and magnetic fields, ensuring no disruptions to local communities or the environment.
Jens Scharff, Mayor of Auerbach, expressed strong support for the project, emphasizing that leveraging local geothermal resources could provide long-term energy security for the region.
The data collected from this phase will be analyzed over the coming months, determining the next steps for deep geothermal development in the Ostvogtland region. With the involvement of experienced companies, strong local backing, and the use of cutting-edge technology, this project represents a significant step toward sustainable heating in Saxony.

Philadelphia Gas Works is seeking a qualified firm to do a feasibility study for a planned geothermal heating and cooling system for school district buildings.

![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
Proposals will be accepted only until 15 April 2025
The goal of the RFP is to identify a firm to conduct a detailed site survey and feasibility study to determine the technical and economic viability of implementing a shared geothermal heating and cooling system at the primary networked site, which is the John F. McCloskey Elementary School and Dorothy Emanuel Recreation Center. A secondary site, the Lankenau High School, will also be evaluated if necessary.
PGW is a city-owned gas utility that has been under pressure in the past few years to explore alternative energy sources to reduce carbon emissions. Establishing geothermal networks was one suggestion made to the company by a 2021 study, as well as a group of area congregations.
“We have been advocating for PGW to conduct a networked geothermal pilot project for several years,”“We’re glad to see PGW taking this step.”
#### Replacing aged and inefficient systems
PGW met with city representatives and other experts to select locations that will work best for a geothermal pilot. McCloskey was chosen as it is one of the schools that does not have air-conditioning, but has ample nearby space for geothermal wells. Built in 1956, McCloskey currently relies on oil heating.
”We’ll see the largest benefit if we switch to a geothermal system as far as reduction of greenhouse gases,” “It aligns with just having a healthier, safer learning environment and improved air quality, and energy savings.”

A geothermal-themed park is being proposed by the Imperial County Board for funding by the California Energy Commission in the city of Calipatria.

The Imperial County Board of Supervisors has announced a plan to submit an application for funding for a proposed geothermal-themed outdoor park in the city of Calipatria to the
The proposal was presented at the board meeting by Deputy County Executive Officer of Natural Resources Bari Bean. The drawings shown during the presentation showed a colorful and interactive park with a shaded play area and education features showing geology, geothermal, and lithium technology topics.
“As you can see from the visuals on the screen, this is a vibrant, one-of-a-kind initiative that we’ve created here at the county. It’s truly an opportunity for our residents and visitors alike to take a journey to the core of the earth,”
The geothermal-themed project is planned as an extension of the ongoing Community Part Initiative in Calipatria, which is already being partially funded by the California Department of Parks. Upon completion, the park will move under the ownership of the city of Calipatria.
Bean further explained that the funding application for the geothermal part falls under Category K of the funding program which supports “enhancement, restoration, or preservation of natural resources.” The loan is designed to support communities that have geothermal by funding projects in the areas of socioeconomic impact, public service infrastructure, and lithium initiatives.
#### A demand for geothermal training
Reception to the proposal for a geothermal-themed park has been mixed, with critics stating that the funding can be better spent on other things.
William Cooper, Executive Director of The Becoming Project in California, stated that community members are not asking for “a monument to geothermal in Calipatria.” Instead, people are asking for some actual training in the field of geothermal. “Things like these are just going to give the community more information about geothermal. The community of Calipatria has information about geothermal. It’s been there for 40 years
However, the initiative has received a healthy amount of support from local legislators and industry partners including Imperial Irrigation District, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the North End Alliance, and Geothermal Rising.
Supervisor Ryan Kelley responded to the criticism, stating that the funding’s requirements meant that it can only be applied to specific types of geothermal-related projects. Other community needs, such as those for infrastructure, are outside of the scope of the funding program.

![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 6 Dec 2024
JESDER Chairman Ufuk Sentürk highlighted the impact of geothermal in helping Türkiye achieve its energy independence and sustainable development goals.
![](
![](

In an interview with a local newspaper, Ufuk Sentürk, Chairman of the
According to Sentürk, Türkiye’s installed geothermal capacity has reached 1,726 MWe over 40 years. In 2023, these plants generated a total of 11,000 GWh of electricity, accounting for 4% of the country’s total energy production. Geothermal energy also helped prevent $500 million worth of natural gas imports.
#### $1.2 billion economic impact in 2023
In the first 10 months of 2024, geothermal energy production accounted for 3.2% of total energy generation, generating $1 billion in revenue. By the end of the year, this figure is expected to reach the 2023 level of $1.2 billion.
Sentürk noted that a total of $5 billion has been invested in Türkiye’s geothermal energy sector to date. He emphasized the sector’s use of up to 70% locally produced equipment, low land requirements, and contributions to local employment. Sentürk highlighted geothermal energy’s critical role in reducing energy dependency due to its ability to provide uninterrupted power generation.
Geothermal energy is not limited to electricity production alone. According to JESDER data:
* 165,500 homes are heated with geothermal resources,
* 700 hectares of greenhouse areas are supported,
* 18,000 hectares of agricultural specialty zones are under development,
* An annual capacity of 5,000 tons of fruit and vegetable drying is provided.
Expressing their desire to further capitalize on the sector’s potential, Sentürk said: “Geothermal energy not only contributes to the local economy but also plays a strategic role in achieving our country’s energy independence. With our goal of full capacity utilization, we will seize every opportunity in this area.”

The announcement was made via a disclosure submitted to the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE Limited).
In mid-2024, OIL announced a cooperation with the Centre for Earth Sciences and Himalayan Studies (CESHS) to carry out studies to assess the geothermal resources in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam. The plan was to eventually progress these studies to a detailed MT survey in the most attractive sites for geothermal development in the region.
The formation of the subsidiary is part of OIL’s low-carbon initiatives toward achieving the objective of Net Zero Emission by 2040. The decision was approved in September 2024 by the Petroleum Ministry, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), and policy think tank NITI Aayog.
A separate source reports that OIL is planning to invest Rs 25,000 crore (USD 2.8 billion) for their renewable energy efforts, with about 1/3 of the investment going to an ethanol plant.

Exploration of two new geothermal systems in Reykjavik by Veitur has been successful, potentially increasing heat supply capacity to the Icelandic capital.

Veitur had previously announced plans for exploratory geothermal drilling at two sites in Reykjavik, specifically Kjalarnes and Geldinganes. Drilling operations are still ongoing, but Veitur can confirm that hot water indeed exists at both drilling sites.
Heating in Reykjavik is currently supplied by hot water from the Nesjavellir and Hellisheði power plants, as well as four low-temperature areas in Mosfellsbær (Reykjum and Reykjahlíð) and Reykjavík (Laugarnesinu and Elliðaárdal). The discovery of two more low-temperature zones within the city limits is a very positive outcome, as the need for energy for domestic heating and economic activity in the area is constantly growing in line with the growing society.
#### Results from drilling
Drilling of research wells in Kjalarnes started in 2022, already indicating that there is a strong temperature anomaly at the far end of Brimnes. It was then decided to drill two research wells to depths of about 800 meters. This autumn, the first well, SV-08, was drilled and confirmed hot water at 100 °C. A preliminary test also indicated flowrates of almost 40 L/s.
Further tests will still be needed to confirm the capacity of the new system, but early estimates indicate that it can produce up to 200 L/s of hot water in Brimnes. This corresponds to the needs of about 10,000 people.
In Geldinganes, well R-44 was drilled this November and tapped hot water at 90 °C and flowrates are estimated at about 20 L/s.
#### Future plans and other exploration work
When the work in SV-08 in Brimnes is completed in the next few days, the rig will then move 300 meters south to the location of well SV-09. More wells are planned to be drilled in the coming years, but if all goes to plant, water from Brimnes can be introduced to the system within 3 to 5 years.
A long-term production test will be done on well R-44 in Geldinganes once drilling has been completed. Information from this test will then be instrumental in planning the drilling of future wells.
Veitur is also drilling research wells in other areas to better map where geothermal energy can be found. When the drilling of well R-44 in Kjalarnes is finished, the drill will move east to Laugalandi in Holtum, where a well will be drilled that will hopefully be used to increase production for Rangárveita.
Veitur also has geothermal prospecting projects underway in several areas where thin and shallow wells are drilled for geothermal prospecting.
Extensive geothermal research has been carried out in Kjalarnes and Laugalandi in recent years, and the results of those studies were used to locate the wells we are drilling now this fall and winter in Brimnes and Laugalandi in Holtum. Geothermal research is currently underway at Borg á Mýrum and Álftanes, and in the near future research drilling will begin in Ásahreppi. Exploration wells are also being drilled at the southern side of Grafarvog (at Sævarhöfða and Stórhöfða).
Veitur’s plans include following up the exploratory drilling that has been done this year at Álftanes and Borg á Mýrum with deeper drilling that will determine whether usable geothermal energy can be found there.

The funding is granted by the program “Providing access to thermal waters in Poland” implemented by the NFOSiGW. The program allows for up to 100% subsidies granted to local governments for the drilling of a research well.
“The National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management is financing 100 percent of the costs of the research drilling. We are aware that this is the beginning of the development of local heating, but we also wish that other areas in the field of geothermal energy would be used, e.g. in health resorts,”
The subsidy greatly reduces the risk of geothermal exploration drilling and strengthens the resolve of local governments to invest in geothermal energy. If the drilling indicates the potential for economic use, heating companies can then apply to the NFOSiGW for co-financing of the construction of a geothermal heating plant.
A total of PLN 708 million has been planned for the implementation of the “Providing access to thermal waters in Poland” for the years 2020 to 2028. From the fund, PLN 658 million will be allocated for subsidies while PLN 50 million will be used for additional loans. Several funding agreements for geothermal exploration have been signed through the years, with the latest funding agreements signed just in October 2024.

The Italian island of Pantelleria is emerging as a key location for the development of geothermal energy in Sicily, with experts pointing to its unique geological conditions as ideal for low-impact and sustainable energy production.
Located between Sicily and Tunisia, the island is of volcanic origin and has long been recognized for its geothermal activity. A recent initiative led by the
“Pantelleria offers a rare opportunity to develop geothermal energy with minimal environmental impact, and in a way that benefits both the island and the broader Sicilian region,”
With support from the
Pantelleria’s geothermal system is considered ideal for a “binary cycle” plant, which does not release emissions into the atmosphere and has a low surface footprint—making it especially suitable for areas with natural and cultural value.
The ongoing research includes geophysical surveys, well monitoring, and environmental assessments to better understand the island’s geothermal reservoir. The results are promising and point toward a sustainable, long-term resource capable of supplying clean, baseload energy to the local grid.
Why Pantelleria matters for geothermal in Italy
Italy has long been a leader in geothermal energy, with the Larderello region in Tuscany being the world’s first site of geothermal electricity production. However, there is now growing interest in expanding geothermal development across southern Italy and the islands, where volcanic activity presents significant untapped potential.
Pantelleria may become the “southern front” of Italy’s geothermal renaissance—contributing to decarbonization goals, reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels, and offering a resilient solution to energy supply in island environments.
For the geothermal sector
Pantelleria is a prime example of how academic institutions, public agencies, and local communities can collaborate to unlock geothermal potential in a responsible and innovative way. The island’s initiative sets a precedent for sustainable energy development in sensitive regions, opening doors for future investments and public-private partnerships across the Mediterranean.
We previously reported on efforts to explore the geothermal potential of Sicily.

The study seeks to answer four questions:
* What issues are faced by agrifood communities in Belize?
* How might geothermal resources and technologies benefit the agrifood system in Belize?
* How might agrifood businesses adapt to climate variability, become more energy-efficient, and sustainable?
* How might R&D projects be realized ‘on the ground’ in Belize so that the agrifood communities can see and understand geothermal energy working?
A baseline assessment indicated that the geothermal technologies has had a negligible effect so far on the agrifood sector in Belize. There is, however, a need for more measures the reduce the energy costs in production and processing in the agrifood sector. Moreover, geothermal can maximize efficiency, reduce crop costs, and provide optimal growing conditions year-round, thus increasing crop yield.
During the week, participants of the event visited several agrifood facilities in Belize. These included a tilapia farm, a company that manufactures various products from chili peppers, the agriculture campus of the University of Belize, and the research facilities of CARDI. These visits provided insights on ‘on the ground’ realities of the agrifood sector which will determine the direction of future work.
At the end of the week, the group discussed the next steps for this initiative:
1. There will be a benchmarking of greenhouse cooling systems
2. There was a consensus to collaborate on a small R&D project

An information board has been installed at the site of the Velika Gorica geothermal site in Croatia, marking the start of the drilling work for the VGGT-1 geothermal well. Drilling is expected to commence by mid-December and continue until July 2025.
The VGGT-1 well will be drilled vertically to a target depth of 2900 meters, with the possibility of deepening by an additional 20 meters. Two reservoirs are expected to be intersected by the well – one at 2020 meters, and another at 2770 meters. Expected temperatures of the geothermal waters is at 90 °C.
Exploration activities at the Velika Gorica preliminary exploration area are being carried out as part of the project “Development of geothermal potential for heating needs” which is financed by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP). The project aims to increase the contribution of renewable energy sources, and specifically geothermal, in the country’s heating sector.

KS ORKA Hungary Kft, a subsidiary of Kaishan Co., Ltd. (300257.SZ), has received official confirmation of a geothermal exploration license in the Tura region of Hungary, marking a significant step in expanding the company’s European geothermal portfolio.
The license, issued by the Hungarian Ministry of Energy and Mining Administration, grants exclusive exploration rights over a 171 km² area, with a geothermal depth ranging from 250 to 3,500 meters. Notably, the Turawell geothermal power plant, operational since 2017, is located within this newly designated exploration zone.
Backed by Kaishan Group headquarters, KS ORKA will soon assemble a project team to define drilling targets and design engineering plans. Land acquisition and exploration and production well drilling are expected within the year, with a long-term goal of developing between 50 to 100 MW of geothermal power capacity in the Tura area.
This development reflects Kaishan’s strategic commitment to sustainable energy and strengthens Hungary’s potential as a growing hub for geothermal energy in Central and Eastern Europe.

A residential development with the largest geothermal system for heating and cooling in New York City, 1515 Surf, has officially opened in Coney Island.

We had first reported on this project in the latter half of 2022, but the plans for it had been in place since 2020. A geothermal system was not part of the initial plans for the project, but the developers chose this technology to make the building operations more sustainable. The geothermal system is expected to help the building reduce its carbon emissions by 60%. The utility costs are also expected to be up to 30% lower, with savings of between $150 to $450 per resident per year.
“We spent the better part of a year and a half investigating the constraints and challenges,”That this site was so large and was close to the ocean presented itself as a unique candidate for geothermal.”
Below the building is a geothermal bore field consisting of 153 boreholes, each drilled to a depth of about 499 feet (152 meters). The constant temperature of the geothermal resource tapped by these boreholes means that the system can provide heating during winter and cooling during summer. An array of geothermal heat pumps distribute the energy throughout the building, maintaining temperature and even providing heat to an outdoor pool.

The design and installation of the geothermal system was done by
Although 1515 Surf currently holds the title as the biggest geothermal installation in New York City, there is already a project being developed that aims to snatch this title – an 834-unit residential development in Greenpoint that is expected to open by 2026. The team of LCOR, Studio V, and EcoSave have also started work on a smaller building in Rochelle which will also have a geothermal system. This is expected to be completed by next year.
Encouraged by financial incentives from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority and the Clean Heat, there is clearly a geothermal movement that is gaining momentum in New York. Work is currently ongoing for 1 Java Street in Brooklyn, a mixed-use development that will incorporate a geothermal heat pump system. With the passing of a law earlier this year that makes it easier to drill geothermal wells beyond 500 feet depth, deep geothermal systems are likely to have a more prominent presence in New York moving forward.

Through the collaboration, FutEra also seeks to add waste heat recovery to existing oil and gas assets such as compressor stations.
Through this collaboration, Orcan will gain access to both large oil and gas refineries and a diverse pipeline of geothermal projects across Canada, tapping into FutEra’s local expertise and experience. For the oil and gas sector, adding waste heat recovery to existing assets will generate emission-free electricity from waste heat and significantly improve their overall efficiency.
For the geothermal scope, the focus will be on maximizing the energy efficiency of smaller and mid-sized geothermal projects. Orcan’s know-how in modular waste heat recovery solutions fits well with FutEra’s mission of developing geothermal and waste heat projects..
In early 2023, FutEra announced the start of operations of Canada’s first co-produced natural gas and geothermal power project in Swan Hills, Alberta. A few months later, the majority stake of FutEra was transferred from Razor Energy Corp. to the Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo).
Orcan’s waste heat recovery technology turns heat into clean electricity. Applying this modular technology will not only improve the operational efficiency of oil and gas assets and geothermal projects but also significantly reduce CO? emissions, helping Canada’s energy sector transition towards a more sustainable and diverse energy industry.
Orcan has already proven the reliability and efficiency of their modules with implementations at compressor stations and geothermal projects, among others.

“This collaboration marks an important step for us in entering the Canadian market. With FutEra’s local expertise and our innovative technology, we are excited to contribute to the decarbonization of the energy sector by leveraging a wide array of projects,”
“We are thrilled to partner with Orcan to bring scalable and modular solutions that work well in the oil, gas and geothermal sectors. Together, we can even tap into the sunk value of subeconomic oil and gas assets to maximize the efficiency of geothermal projects. For us, a strong business case, short implementation timelines, and a modular, scalable approach were essential. Orcan meets those requirements”

Australian geothermal developer
The TEFS work was done for both the Paralana and West Flinders site of EEI in South Australia, following up on a review previously done by JRG Energy that indicated that these assets have the potential for commercial electricity generation. The company has now spent more than $40 million in fieldwork and studies for these two geothermal sites.
“GLJ’s preliminary findings affirm our belief in Paralana’s potential as an Enhanced Geothermal System project. Independently validating Paralana’s permeability and stress conditions for EGS development is both significant and valuable,”
“Momentum around EGS is building, spurred by pioneering successes in the USA, where projects in Nevada and Utah are setting the stage. Paralana stands alongside these leading efforts, and our collaboration with GLJ will showcase this further. Earths Energy is dedicated to rapidly advancing Paralana as a world-class EGS project, backed by GLJ’s expertise and our skilled team.”
#### Paralana as priority EGS target
GLJ’s work has confirmed that the Paralana Project, drilled to 3,685 metres with a bottom hole temperature of 171°C, has favourable characteristics for an EGS development. The TEFS has highlighted favourable permeability at Paralana, where zones of existing fractures have been interpreted from borehole image data and micro seismic monitoring during stimulation below the 150°C isotherm depth in the Paralana-2 well. In-situ stress fields with a principal horizontal stress approximately in the E-W direction were observed above the target depths, which appear to provide a favourable horizontal well drilling stress environment for EGS implementation.

The TEFS has also shown that the Flinders West licenses require additional subsurface evaluation and potentially exploration drilling to further derisk the geothermal potential for EGS.
As such, development of Paralana will be prioritised, while the Company will look at options to firm up the subsurface data available for Flinders West, including collaboration with other groups in the area.

# Geothermal Rising expands into Canada with acquisition of CanGEA
!Geothermal Rising expands into Canada with acquisition of CanGEA CanGEA & Geothermal Rising acquisition
![ ](
![ ]( Alexander Richter 20 Jan 2025
With its acquisition of the Canadian Geothermal Energy Association (CanGEA), Geothermal Rising establishes a foothold in Canada giving a stronger voice to geothermal in both countries.

Last week, it was reported that U.S.-based geothermal association Geothermal Rising has acquired the Canadian Geothermal Energy Association (CanGEA).
With the acquisition, CanGEA will be renamed to Geothermal Rising Canada. The transaction was supported by the Boards of both organizations, as well as the member companies of CanGEA.
Geothermal Rising Canada will carry on the pivotal work of CanGEA. “I’m most proud of how we provided opportunities to the next generation of energy workers, often in support of their goals to transition to green energy. We empowered dozens of youth and underrepresented groups via employment and mentorship at CanGEA,” stated former CanGEA Managing Director and Chair Alison Thompson.
CanGEA has successfully influenced and changed federal and provincial laws and regulations for nearly 2 decades. CanGEA has had a mission to empower the geothermal community and promote geothermal technology, same as Geothermal Rising. We are thrilled to announce that in 2025, CanGEA is becoming Geothermal Rising Canada!
“We are grateful for the dedication and impact CanGEA has made with remarkable support from volunteers, not least of which are the organization’s Board members: Alison Thompson, Brian Toohey, and Donovan Nielsen,” said Dr. Bryant Jones, Executive Director of GR. “With GR assuming control of Geothermal Rising Canada (formerly CanGEA), we can leverage resources to better and more loudly amplify the research conducted by governments, pilot projects carried out by universities, and new developments and technologies advanced by industry.”
The momentum is building for the geothermal industry in Canada. The federal and provincial governments are taking notice, the World Geothermal Congress will be held in Canada in 2026, and Canadian geothermal companies are making headlines in Canada and around the globe.
“Geothermal energy is gaining significant momentum worldwide, with over $47 billion invested in 2023 and supporting 140,000 jobs globally. Now, more than ever, it is crucial to unite efforts and foster collaboration across the entire geothermal value chain in both Canada and the United States to build on this momentum. I am thrilled about the tremendous opportunity to leverage the expertise, resources, and influence of Geothermal Rising to enhance and scale the impactful policy and regulatory work that CanGEA has championed for the past two decades in Canada,” said Jeanine Vany, GR Board member and Executive Vice President and co-founder of Eavor Technologies.
“Geothermal Rising has effectively enhanced the visibility of geothermal heat and power technologies across the United States. The collaboration between Geothermal Rising and CanGEA will enable this important work to extend into Canada,” stated Emily Smejkal, a Science Fellow at the Cascade Institute and Board member of Geothermal Canada. “Although Canada’s geothermal resources are well-documented scientifically, their utilization has been limited. Geothermal Rising’s expertise in promoting geothermal energy in the United States will be invaluable in developing a robust industry in Canada. The establishment of Geothermal Rising Canada marks an exciting advancement for the geothermal sector.”
Through this merger, Geothermal Rising will organize knowledge sharing opportunities in Canada, empower Indigenous voices through the Indigenous Geothermal Symposium, expand the Regional Interest Group (RIG) initiative, familiarize external audiences about geothermal energy (such as the media, investors, and policymakers), and support the work of the International Geothermal Association and Geothermal Canada to host a successful WGC 2026 in Calgary!
“Geothermal energy development is a North American opportunity. It makes a lot of sense to have one body, Geothermal Rising, as the voice to represent an industry looking to grow its footprint,” said Lisa Mueller, GR Board member-elect, and CEO of FutEra Energy, the first geothermal developer in Canada to have electrons on the grid.

The start of drilling work is currently planned for the second quarter of 2025, subject to the successful commissioning of the drilling rig. As soon as the financing of the first project phase is completed, Vercana will begin installing the second electric drilling rig “V10” at the planned Trappelberg drilling site.
The construction of the V20 drilling rig follows the successful completion of key infrastructure work such as the construction of the Schleidberg drilling site, the establishment of the crew camp and the development of the access road. The electric drilling rig has an output of 2,500 hp, a hook load capacity of 550 tons and is equipped with a high-pressure pump system with up to 7,500 psi.
During the construction work on the rig, there will be increased transport traffic around the drilling site. The transports are organized in close coordination with the responsible authorities to ensure smooth implementation and speedy execution and thus keep disruption to residents as low as possible.
The mining authority approved the special operating plan and transport permits for V20 in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, further permits were issued for special components of the drilling rig. After the rig has been constructed, routine commissioning and testing procedures will follow to ensure safe and efficient operation.
Vulcan is currently working on the implementation of the first project phase “Lionheart” in the Landau region. The combined production of climate-neutral lithium and renewable energy will provide green district heating for households in the region. In addition, in phase one, Vulcan will produce around 24,000 tons of climate-neutral lithium hydroxide monohydrate annually for the automotive industry in Germany and Europe. This amount of lithium is sufficient to produce 500,000 electric vehicle batteries per year.
Managing Director and CEO of Vulcan Energy, Cris Moreno, comments: “The construction of the V20 drilling rig is not only an important milestone for our Lionheart project, but also an important step on the way to establishing a sustainable and domestic supply chain for lithium. With two fully electric and modern drilling rigs and an experienced team, our in-house drilling company Vercana is excellently equipped to safely implement the deep geothermal drilling for the production of renewable energy and lithium here in the Upper Rhine Graben in the coming years. This will enable us to contribute to supplying the region with renewable base heat and support the transition to electromobility in Germany and Europe.”
“We are now entering a new phase of project development in which the safety and quality of the execution of our project is our top priority. In order to meet our high standards, we will work closely with all important partners and stakeholders in the region.”

The Department of Ecological Transition and Energy of the Government of the Canary Islands has awarded geothermal exploration contracts in the islands of La Palma, Tenerife and Gran Canaria to a total of nine entities. With this, the tender has been officially closed and the funding of EUR 106 million from theannounced in 2023 will be appropriately allocated.
The fieldwork corresponding to these licenses are expected to begin between late December to early January 2025.
La Palma will be receiving EUR 48 million to support the exploration of 837 blocks covering practically the entire southern half of the island. These licenses have been awarded to six companies:
* Repsol Exploracion
* Energia Geotermica de Canarias
* Geotermia La Palma
* Sodepal
* Sodescan 2000
* Tajogaite Energia
Tenerife will also be receiving EUR 43.2 million for the exploration of 516 mining blocks. Exploration in Tenerife has been awarded to two companies:
* Energia Geotermica de Canarias
* Instituto Tecnologico y de Energies Renovables de Tenerife (ITER)
Lastly, the island of Gran Canaria has awarded exploration for a total of 182 mining grids, to be supported by EUR 15 million in funding. The contract has been awarded at the proposal of the Gran Canaria Island Energy Council.
“Now the next step depends on the public and private developers who have been awarded the contract,”
Moreover, an environmental impact assessment will not be needed for the surveys granted that they will be carried out outside of protected natural areas. This exemption had been granted to facilitate the progress of these studies. The contracts currently specify a deadline for completing the work by 31 January 2026, but the Minister is anticipating that this deadline will need to be extended.

The fundraise will help in the further development of the current drilling prototypes into fully fledged drilling systems, capable of reliably drilling holes of up to 250 meters deep – beyond market depth for shallow geothermal drilling in most countries. With its highly space- and energy-efficient setup that drills boreholes autonomously, Borobotics aims to make geothermal energy considerably more accessible, simpler and cost-effective.
“Geothermal heat pumps are great, but expensive. Borobotics has developed a new technology platform to dramatically bring down the cost and complexity of shallow geothermal drilling. UGV is excited to lead the company’s first equity round, and is looking forward to working with the team to redefine the economics of shallow geothermal,”

House Bill 361 has been signed by the Governor of New Mexico, establishing a framework for the conversion of oil and gas wells to geothermal energy facilities.
![](

![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico in the United States has signed
HB361, known as the “Well Repurposing Act,” grants the authority to the New Mexico Energy, Minerals, and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD) to convert oil and gas wells into energy storage or geothermal energy facilities. Moreover, the department may establish fees and financial assistance requirements specific to the energy storage or geothermal development uses.
The bill also defines a “geothermal resource” as the natural heat of the earth in excess of 250 °F (121 °C) including all minerals in solutions obtained from naturally heated fluids, excluding oil and other hydrocarbons.
“New Mexico has nearly 2,000 orphaned wells across our state, sitting unused and posing pollution risks to our people and environment,“House Bill 361 will not just support the cleanup and methane monitoring of these wells, but repurpose unused and unusable assets for clean energy battery storage and geothermal production — a win-win for all.”
The repurposing of oil and gas wells for geothermal use was also one of the provisions under North Dakota’s Senate Bill 2360, which was also just signed by the Governor recently.

Researchers from the UGM in partnership with Pertamina Geothermal Energy have developed and tested a novel geothermal nanosilica fertilizer in Indonesia.

The fertilizer, called “Katrili,” was said to help nourish the soil, strengthen plant cell walls, and inhibit water release. Since being planted in July 2024, the fertilizer has yielded satisfactory results for the “Gustave” variety of tomatoes in the Tonsewer village in Minahasa Regency, North Sulawesi. These results were announced during a joint harvest conducted on 31 October 2024 with partner farmers and researchers in attendance, as well as representatives from PGEO, the Minahasa Regency Government, and community leaders.
“Katrili” has made tomato plants grow tall and resistant to pests. The fruits are abundant, large (diameter 5-8 cm), the flesh is thick and tastes sweet and fresh. Partner farmers from the Minahasa Protestant Church Farmers Group and the Minahasa Evangelical Christian Church Farmers Group stated that even tomatoes planted during the dry season can still grow perfectly.
Laboratory test results have also proven that plants that receive the geothermal nanosilica liquid fertilizer and booster named Katrili are safe to consume because they do not contain heavy metals. Farmers send some of their abundant yields to Timika in Central Papua. Although shipping takes about a week, the tomatoes remain fresh.

The researchers involved in developing innovations to utilize geothermal by-products are Ir. Pri Utami, M.Sc., Ph.D (geothermal expert, Department of Geological Engineering), Dr.rer.nat. Ronny Martien (nanotechnology expert, Faculty of Pharmacy), Dr. Ngadisih (soil and water conservation engineering expert, Faculty of Agricultural Technology), as well as technicians and junior researchers Teguh Triyana, STP and Muhammad Fatih Fauzi, S.Si.
The development of fertilizer from the byproducts of geothermal energy utilization is one of many ways that geothermal projects can provide significant and tangible benefits to the livelihood of nearby communities. A similar project had also been done by UGM in partnership with PT Geo Dipa Energi in the Dieng Highlands.
In the future, the “Katrili” fertilizer will be applied to plant other well-known Minahasa crops such as chili, shallots, beans, and rice.

More than 150 professionals from the geothermal and oil & gas sectors, representing 20+ countries, are set to attend the highly anticipated 25-26 March 2025Vienna, Austria
Registration for the event is still open –
Geothermal taps into underground thermal reservoirs, providing a reliable source of heat and/or power. At present, the number of geothermal wells drilled globally is of the order of 600-800 per year. Predictions, however, suggest that this number will increase at least five-fold within the next couple of decades.
The vast majority of these wells will be drilled by IADC member companies.
Hosted in partnership with OMV, this inaugural IADC conference will focus on Geothermal Upstream, including a market outlook, subsurface, drilling, production, completions, regulatory environment, and associated topics. The participants will gain insights into relevant business and ownership models, contracting and procurement strategies, and supply chains.
Several eminent industry leaders to give keynote and opening presentations at the conference, including:
* Angelika Zartl-Klik,
* Marit Brommer, •
* Bruce Gatherer,
The conference will showcase groundbreaking technologies with the potential to revolutionize the geothermal industry and the entire energy sector. IADC’s expertise in providing definitions and guidelines for the Petroleum Upstream ideally positions it to establish a vocabulary, terms, and standards within the geothermal industry.
Geothermal energy regulatory regimes are inconsistent, and immature compared to those of the oil and gas industry, which creates obstacles and extends the lead time for geothermal projects. The conference will analyze differences in regulatory regimes and provide valuable insights for businesses and regulators.
Leading companies taking part include OMV, Boston Consulting Group, Eavor Technologies, ENI SpA, European Geothermal Energy Council, Geothermal Rising, Halliburton, H&P, Herrenknecht Vertical, Huisman, Iceland Drilling, International Energy Agency, International Geothermal Association, Nabors, NOV, Parker Wellbore, Rystad Energy, TNO, Weatherford, and more.
Three panel sessions will be held throughout the two-day conference discussing “A Rapid Growth in Geothermal Energy: What Will It Take to Happen?”, “Traditional Drilling & New Technologies,” and “People Versus Robots.”
The conference further includes five technical sessions covering “Urban Drilling,” “Well Design,” “How Do We Address Supply Chain Capacity & Scale Issues?”, “Wellbore Placement & Ranging,” and “Well Control.”
Examples of other important presentations to be made include “Geothermal Market Outlook,” “IADC’s Geothermal Well Drilling Guideline,” and “IEA Report: “The Future of Geothermal.”
Join the IADC Geothermal Drilling Conference & Exhibition to discuss the exciting developments happening in the upstream aspects of geothermal energy production and the issues to be addressed. Be a part of the transformation that the geothermal industry has the potential to bring to the entire energy sector.
#### About IADC
The
member companies collectively accounts for nearly 80% of all wells drilled globally. Its key focus areas include hosting industry conferences and enhancing workforce competence, with more than 125,000 students participating annually in IADC-accredited training programs.
#### IADC’s engagement in geothermal drilling
Other trade organizations do an excellent job supporting the industry. However, when IADC’s Geothermal Committee started its work in 2022, it soon became clear that there were areas where IADC’s engagement would be welcomed. Not least has the association’s experience and expertise in creating definitions and guidelines turned out to be particularly helpful in establishing a common language across the industry.
In that regard, intense work is going on in the IADC Geothermal Committee to write a Geothermal Well Drilling Guideline. The publication of the first part of this guideline is imminent.

![](
![](
![](
![](
The Presidency of Colombia, through the
Decree 1598 of 2024, which modifies Decree 1073 of 2015, seeks to introduce a competitive process for the allocation of geothermal permits, as well as guidelines to strengthen the interaction of project developers with local communities, among other changes. The new regulation was announced by Energy Minister Andrés Camacho.
Minister Camacho highlighted the key role of this initiative in Colombia’s energy diversification: “With Decree 1598 of December 27, 2024, Colombia consolidates its path towards the exploration and use of geothermal energy, an industry that is growing worldwide.”
#### Main changes introduced by Decree 1598:
1. Enhanced exploration procedures:
2. Economic viability assessment:
3. Advanced drilling techniques:
4. Environmental protection:
#### Featured modifications
Additionally, the following modifications are highlighted in the new decree:
* Change in the allocation of permits:
* Round-based allocation mechanism:
* Social guidelines for community relations:
* Access to the network and market development:
* Cascading use of geothermal resources:
#### Perspectives and challenges
While the new regulation provides a solid framework for geothermal energy projects, some challenges remain, including high initial costs, technological requirements and the need for specialized labor. However, its successful implementation could position Colombia as a leader in geothermal energy in Latin America, contributing to the country’s energy security and economic growth.
Colombia currently only has one small-scale 100-kW geothermal power plant at the Las Maracas field Casanare and Caldas regions.

A detailed study published by the Ministry of Energy of Moldova highlights the country's geothermal potential and the regulatory gaps to further development.
![](

![](
A detailed report on the potential for geothermal development, the barriers and challenges, and a proposed geothermal development strategy for the Republic of Moldova has been published by the country’s
The full report (in Moldovan) can be accessed
According to the study, geothermal energy has the potential to play a significant role in Moldova’s energy mix, with a focus on the horizon up to 2035. By implementing this strategy, Moldova could reduce its dependence on external energy sources, contribute to combating climate change, and stimulate sustainable economic development.
The document examines existing wells and their technical documentation from the archives of the Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources. It finds that shallow geothermal sources can be used for heating residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, as well as for cooling spaces during the warm season using the same infrastructure. Meanwhile, deep geothermal sources can be utilized for heat production for urban networks and industrial applications (processes that use steam, hot air, or hot water), agricultural applications (greenhouse heating, aquaculture, drying), and recreational applications (swimming pools, aquatic centers, steam baths).
#### Pilot projects proposed
The document proposes a series of pilot projects that aim to utilize geothermal for heating in urban areas by 2027 to 2029. These projects include wells in the municipality of Chisinau (temperatures of up to 53°C at a depth of 1,140m), in Cahul (depths of 500-600m), and wells in the villages of Gura Cainarului and Marculesti, Floresti district.
The expansion of geothermal heating systems in municipalities and rural areas had also been proposed, as well as the building of small to medium-capacity geothermal power plants in regions with high geothermal potential. The estimated costs for developing the geothermal sector amount to approximately €300 million over 12 years, covering construction, installation, and/or modernization of the necessary thermal heating infrastructure.
#### Geothermal lacks a regulatory framework
A significant part of the document outlines the existing regulatory framework in Moldova that can be considered applicable to geothermal. Geothermal has already been included in the country’s legal framework for promoting the use of and establishing national objectives for energy from renewable sources. There are also laws on the protection of subsurface resources and for establishing management and protection rights for groundwater sources.
However, the regulations in Moldova are far from enough to fully and effectively support geothermal development. The study proposes some regulations that can help achieve this goal:
* Regulations on the definition and classification of geothermal resource
* Regulations on licensing and concessions of geothermal sites
* Environmental protection regulations, particularly during exploration and exploitation of geothermal resources
* Regulations that promote energy efficiency and the use of cutting-edge technologies
* Fiscal and financial incentives for geothermal investments
* Regulations for cooperation between institutions and private-public partnerships
* Regulations for training and professional education in the geothermal field
* Regulations for monitoring and reporting of geothermal activities

The
The full report, “Advancing Geothermal: Fiscal Year 2024 Accomplishments Report,”
In support of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Geothermal Technologies Office’s (GTO) mission to increase geothermal energy deployment through research, development, and demonstration of innovative technologiesthat enhance exploration and production, NREL has led impactful research in geothermal technologies and resources, market acceleration, and grid
integration while also demonstrating leadership in the sector and increasing stakeholder engagement and outreach efforts.
In fiscal year 2024, NREL broadened its research, development, demonstration, and deployment (RDD&D) portfolio and partnerships with exciting innovations such as next-generation geothermal technologies for power, geothermal energy networks for heating and cooling, subsurface thermal energy storage, well repurposing, and more.
NREL’s Geothermal Research Program is centered around three pillars: Technologies and Resources Research, Market Acceleration Research, and Geothermal Grid Integration Research. The following are just some of the highlighted research initiatives featured on the annual accomplishments report:
* The DErisking Exploration for geothermal Plays in magmatic ENvironments (DEEPEN) project
* The Geothermal Limitless Approach to Drilling Efficiencies (GLADE) project
* The GTO funded the Geothermal Heat Pump Case Study in 2024 to help tackle the misconception that heat pumps are only usable in specific and limited climate conditions. The case study featured 20 successful cases of geothermal heat pump applications across the US. Follow-on work in FY25 will amplify the FY24 project as well as add new case studies to the compilation.
* NREL partnered with multiple DOE offices in FY24 including GTO, the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), and others to conduct an analysis to support the DOE “Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Next-Generation Geothermal Power” report.
The report also highlights ongoing strategic partnerships of NREL with industry and non-DOE government agencies. A notable example is the US Department of Defense, for which NREL provides technical assistance to support initiatives by several military bases to utilize geothermal for reliable baseload electricity and heating.

# Research explores Collective Vision-Making for transitioning “stuck” geothermal market
!Research explores Collective Vision-Making for transitioning “stuck” geothermal market ""Building the Geothermal Energy Sector in Northern Ireland Workshop II"" organized by QUB and NIHE (source: QUB)
![ ](
![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 31 Oct 2024
A new research proposes the use of a Collective Vision-Making Model for driving geothermal market transformation through collective stakeholder collaboration.

The geothermal energy market, though rich with potential, remains “stuck” compared to other renewable sources like wind and solar. This is especially true in Northern Ireland, where geothermal development has seen limited commercial success despite government and academic interest.
A new study led by Joseph Fitzpatrick Ireland explores how a collective, multi-stakeholder vision-making process can catalyze market momentum and encourage institutional collaboration by cultivating a shared vision and mutual understanding among diverse stakeholders. This approach emphasizes that sustainable geothermal expansion requires a shared vision that considers local ecosystems and global sustainability goals.
The full paper, “Collective vision-making practice: A long-run dynamic process model for geothermal market transitioning,”Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews
The research introduces a dynamic process model that highlights the role of collective vision-making in fostering a shared understanding among multi-stakeholders. By aligning diverse interests, this model aims to unlock geothermal energy’s potential, which remains underutilised in many regions. The findings highlight the importance of stakeholder engagement across institutional and technological boundaries to develop a sustainable market framework that advances geothermal projects.
This research holds particular relevance for policymakers, market actors, and industry leaders seeking to overcome the “stuck” nature of the geothermal market and accelerate its contribution to the global renewable energy mix.
#### The ‘stuck’ nature of the geothermal market
The concept of being “stuck” comes from Michael Porter’s theory on competitive strategy, applied here to an entire market. The geothermal market’s slow growth is attributed to factors such as high costs, geological variability, and complex regulatory requirements.
Unlike wind or solar, which have benefited from clear policy support, geothermal energy lacks consistent development frameworks across different regions. Northern Ireland’s geothermal potential has been noted in several studies, yet local adoption remains limited, thus maintaining a high reliance on imported fossil fuels.
This study goes beyond viewing these issues as isolated barriers. It suggests they are symptoms of a broader institutional gap where stakeholders lack a shared vision. By developing a collective, dynamic model that aligns all the various actors, the research introduces a pathway to reshape the geothermal market’s growth trajectory.
#### The Collective Vision-Making Model
The heart of this study is a six-dimensional model for collective vision-making, which is designed to address the geothermal market’s stagnation by promoting a collaborative, multi-stakeholder process. Each dimension involves specific practices that encourage stakeholders to co-create a future vision for geothermal energy.
![]( vision-making practice model. (source: Ireland et al, 2024)
1. Imagining
2. Identifying
3. Growing
4. Multiplying
5. Leading
6. Grounding
These first-order visual dimensions are interconnected through twelve second-order behavioural practice: defining-developing, animating-storying, piloting-platforming, localising-globalising, transforming-serving, and traditionalising-modernising.
Each dimension in this model represents a crucial step in transitioning from isolated actions to a unified geothermal market that benefits from a comprehensive institutional foundation.
#### Ethnographic and longitudinal Insights
The research employs a longitudinal ethnographic methodology, allowing the researchers to capture the evolving dynamics within Northern Ireland’s geothermal sector. The research spanned four years and included direct involvement in workshops, interviews with stakeholders, and ethnographic observations across public and private forums.
Using a “Living Codebook” system, the researchers documented each stage of their analysis, from initial observations to refined insights. Notably, the ethnographic approach enabled a deep understanding of how community concerns and institutional barriers impact geothermal projects, with findings reflecting real-world complexities that go beyond theoretical models.
#### Implications for thought leaders and policymakers
* A greater emphasis on intangible relational spaces instead of focusing solely on technologies, policy, geology, and other material understandings of the energy sector. This means prioritizing the allocation of resources to support socio-cognitive institutional work including workshops and energy conferences, as well as the provision of spaces for discussion, consultation, disagreement, and dispute.
* Thought leaders and policymakers must conscientiously practice collective vision-making beyond just being performative and use it as a tool for meaningful engagement. This requires shifting away from doing to be seen. This means maintaining socio-cognitive work over a sustained period, thus creating institutional stances that can be transitioned to policy missions.
* Collective vision-making practice provides a relational orbiting tool around which the relationally ‘stuck’ can become unstuck. Leaders and policymakers should connect local and international influences to create broader change. Tools such as the “two-table negotiation” model allows for different viewpoints and interests to be considered, helping to ease strict stances and create a more cooperative market approach for geothermal energy.
* Stakeholders in the geothermal industry should take advantage of network-building opportunities, particularly through online interaction. However, such type of engagement may miss out on some influential players such as government representatives. Leaders should adopt a collaborative platform mindset that invites more voices into discussions about geothermal energy, aiming to balance diverse perspectives thoughtfully. Key questions could include how to unlock new value by engaging various market perspectives and how to align all actors around a shared vision for long-term, sustainable market development.
#### Broader applications and future work
While focused on Northern Ireland’s geothermal market, this model has potential applications across other renewable energy sectors facing similar challenges. The emphasis on collective vision-making and iterative development offers a blueprint for transitioning “stuck” markets toward sustainable growth. Future research could explore adapting this model to regions with different socio-political contexts or integrating it into global energy policy frameworks.
The study concludes by calling for interdisciplinary approaches that combine insights from institutional theory, market transition studies, and renewable energy policy. By continuing to refine and test the collective vision-making model, future research can contribute valuable knowledge that accelerates the global transition to renewable energy.

A research project on CO2 reinjection in geothermal power generation facilities by
Under current practices in most parts of the world, geothermal power stations emit naturally occurring CO2 that is initially dissolved in the geothermal fluid as part of the power generation process. The operators of geothermal power plants are trialing systems that capture and reinject this CO2back underground where it came from, which stops it being released to the atmosphere.
This multi-disciplinary project aims to better understand how this reinjected CO2 affects the overall chemistry of the geothermal system and its influence on mineral scale deposition deep underground. Results of initial tests have been announced by GNS, indicating that CO2 reinjection has added benefits in terms of scaling mitigation.
Mercury had also conducted tests on CO2 capture and reinjection previously, notably at the Ngatamariki geothermal power station.

Geothermal developer Fervo Energy has announced a new 31 MW Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Shell Energy North America. The deal marks another significant step forward for geothermal energy in the U.S., reinforcing its role as a scalable, dispatchable clean energy source.
This is a milestone deal for geothermal in California. Under the agreement, Shell Energy will purchase 31 megawatts of firm geothermal power from Fervo’s Cape Station project in Beaver County, Utah. The electricity will be delivered to California’s grid, supporting Shell Energy’s power delivery obligations to large energy customers and retail providers across the state.
The PPA supports California’s clean energy goals by supplying round-the-clock, zero-emissions electricity that aligns with long-term reliability needs—especially as the state phases out fossil fuels and scales intermittent renewables like solar and wind.
Part of a growing trend in geothermal procurement
This deal adds to a growing list of corporate and utility geothermal PPAs signed in recent years. Fervo previously secured a 115 MW geothermal PPA with Google, with power also sourced from its Cape Station development.
“Shell Energy is proud to collaborate with Fervo to bring more 24/7 clean electricity to the grid,” said Glenn Wright, President of Shell Energy North America. “This agreement supports our goal of helping customers decarbonize with firm renewable power.”
Advanced technology unlocking new potential
Fervo’s Cape Station project uses enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) and advanced drilling techniques adapted from the oil and gas industry. This approach enables geothermal development in areas previously inaccessible, dramatically expanding potential resources.
According to Fervo, the Cape Station site is expected to come online in 2026 and, once completed, will be the largest next-generation geothermal project in the U.S.
This latest PPA with Shell Energy further cements geothermal’s growing value as a firm, clean energy solution that complements intermittent sources. As more corporations and utilities seek 24/7 carbon-free electricity, geothermal is becoming a cornerstone in clean energy portfolios.
With this agreement, Fervo continues to demonstrate how innovative geothermal development can support grid reliability, emissions reduction, and scalable decarbonization—key priorities in both California and global energy markets.

Members of the Board and Directors of PGEO recently joined local farmers of rice plantations near the Lao-Lao Geothermal Park in South Tomohon District, North Sulawesi for the spraying of the “Katrili” fertilizer. As previously featured, this fertilizer or “liquid booster” was developed by PGEO together with the
Silica deposits from geothermal fluids are processed using nanotechnology with chitosan, producing environmentally friendly and economical liquid fertilizer. The silica in the fertilizer not only nourishes the soil, but also increases the resistance of the crops to pest attacks. Laboratory test results have also proven that plants that receive the geothermal nanosilica liquid fertilizer and booster named Katrili are safe to consume because they do not contain heavy metals.
Aside from deriving more value from geothermal fluids, this initiative also improves the livelihood of famers around PGEO’s operational areas by providing a solution the challenge of fertilizer scarcity.
PGEO had also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with PT Gunung Hijau Masarang for the processing of palm sugar using geothermal fluids.
These efforts are part of PGEO’s concept of being “The Home of Geothermal Beyond Energy.” Indeed, the company has already been recognized for the use of residual geothermal heat for the drying of coffee in the Kamojang area. This process increases the efficiency of the coffee drying process by up to 75%, creating high-quality coffee beans that are sold as the product “Canaya Geothermal Cofffe.”

# California’s geothermal growth faces permitting hurdles
!California’s geothermal growth faces permitting hurdles ThermaSource Rig 108, The Geysers (By: ThinkGeoEnergy)
![ ](

Efforts to expand geothermal in California, including at The Geysers and within the GeoZone, face significant permitting delays compared to other states.
![](

![](
California’s push for increased geothermal energy development is running into long permitting delays, slowing efforts to meet the state’s clean energy targets, as GeoZone initiative, which aims to attract new investment in next-generation geothermal technologies. How far the announced legislation approved by California’s governor in January 2025 solves this and addresses below notes is a bit unclear. Under that law approval processes for geothermal exploratory drilling projects would not have to go through the understaffed California Geologic Energy Management Division (CalGEM), but county planning departments would now be able take the lead in conducting environmental reviews of proposed exploratory drilling projects for geothermal.
Slow permitting vs. growing demand
Despite a state mandate for 2 GW of new geothermal capacity, developers face a two-year permitting process for exploratory drilling – compared to just 10 days on federal land outside California. This creates additional cost and risk, potentially driving investments to other western states.
Key challenges & legislative fixes:
* AB 526 – Calls for a strategic plan for geothermal energy in California.
* AB 527 – Aligns California’s permitting process with federal standards to streamline approvals.
* AB 531 – Expands California Energy Commission oversight to projects of all sizes, not just those above 50 MW.
“Since 1989, nearly all new geothermal development has occurred outside California,” said Geof Syphers, CEO of Sonoma Clean Power, emphasizing the urgency of these legislative changes.
GeoZone & industry partnerships
Sonoma Clean Power’s GeoZone initiative, which we previously reported on at ThinkGeoEnergy, is working to remove barriers for developers. Chevron New Energies recently acquired land within the GeoZone, but permitting bottlenecks have delayed exploratory drilling. Other companies exploring the region include Eavor Technologies and Ormat Technologies.
Additionally, Sonoma, Lake, and Mendocino counties have applied for a $1.3 million California Energy Commission grant to proactively identify low-impact geothermal development sites, aiming to accelerate environmental reviews.
What’s next for California geothermal?
Without reform, California risks losing out on geothermal investment, increasing reliance on imported clean energy—such as Fervo Energy’s 400 MW project in Utah, which will supply power to Southern California Edison but require costly transmission upgrades.

During the recent Praxisforum Geothermie Bayern event in Pullach, Germany, several geothermal power and heating plants in the State of Bavaria were recognized based on their notable achievements in performance and efficiency.
Geothermal energy continues to contribute significantly to the energy needs of Bavaria. “The overall performance is absolutely impressive,”“The 24 Bavarian geothermal plants produced around 2.8 terawatt hours of heat in 2023, which is as much as the entire demand of Nuremberg households.”
The seven geothermal power plants in Bavaria also supplied a total of 133,102 MWh of electricity over the previous year. Almost all systems achieved very high annual availability, which shows the reliability of the technology.
In terms of efficiency, no other heat generation can keep up with geothermal energy. The Bavarian geothermal systems achieved COP values ??of up to 36 – this means that 36 kWh heat are generated from 1 kWh of electrical energy. These are impressive values ??compared to heat pumps, where the conversion of 1 kWh of electricity into 3 to 5 kWh of heat is already considered efficient.
During the same event, KfW and Munich Re announced a joint development risk mitigation program that aims to support further geothermal growth in Germany.
#### Award-winning geothermal plants
Several geothermal heating and power plants in Bavaria were once again recognized during the event to highlight their excellence in efficiency and performance. The awards ceremony was led by Wolfgang Geisinger from Geothermie Unterhaching.
“Golden Heating Plant”“The plant has shown the highest availability of all heating plants, it ran virtually around the clock throughout 2023,“I accept the award on behalf of my colleagues. The project shows that geothermal energy can be scaled. We are making a significant contribution to reducing CO2 in Munich.”
The “Golden Power Plant”“The operators have really worked their way up with this power plant. They use their resources optimally, and they absolutely deserve this award,”“This is a great recognition, both for our power plant and for our team. Thank you.”
Due to special achievements, the organizers have decided to introduce two new prizes this year: The “Golden Borehole” “That is the heat of a small town; the people of Traunreut heat their town with a borehole 20 cm in diameter,” “Of course, this is always a team effort. We do a lot of good here and are happy to share it with the outside world.”
The Waldkraiburg geothermal energy plant was awarded the “Efficiency Master”“The efficiency of geothermal energy is 10 times higher than that of a heat pump and 100 times higher than that of hydrogen. With geothermal energy, we have a big key in our hands and we now have to turn it. The Waldkraiburg geothermal energy plant produced a sensational 36 MWh of heat per MWh of electricity used,“Congratulations for that.”

The EPC contract was officially signed on 24 December 2024, while a handover contract ceremony was held at the head office of SEML on 13 February 2025.
Muara Laboh Unit 2 has a planned installed capacity of 80 MW and is scheduled to be operational by early 2027. Just recently, SEML secured financing of USD 92.6 million from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the project. Shortly before that, SEML also announced an amendment of their PPA with power distributor PT PLN for the 80-MW Muara Laboh Unit 2 and the 60-MW Muara Laboh Unit 3.
SEML is a joint venture between PT Supreme Energy, Sumitomo Corporation, and INPEX Corporation.
#### Engaging with local communities
A few days after the handover ceremony, representatives of PT Supreme Energy and the EPC consortium held a public consultation event with the communities associated with the Muara Laboh Unit 2 project.
Yasin Yunirwansyah of IKPT explained that the workforce for the projects will be composed of more than 50% of local works. “The need for workers during the 30-month project will peak at around 1,500 workers at the end of 2026. The number of workers will continue to decrease towards the completion of the construction of this power plant,
“The implementation of recruitment and placement of workers will be carried out in accordance with statutory provisions and other requirements,” said Yasin. According to him, IKPT will target ready-for-hire workers in the South Solok Regency. The placement of workers will be based on their skills, particularly in certain competencies.
Ismoyo Argo, Senior Manager of Business Relations & General Affairs of Supreme Energy, further emphasized that the project will prioritize the people of South Solok and West Sumatra. This has also been the case for Muara Laboh Unit 1, where almost 90% of the workforce are local residents. This number has continued to grow in the last three years.
“Without collaboration and synergy from all stakeholders, we cannot build and operate this PLTP. Hopefully this project will run smoothly and the production target can be on schedule in 2027,”

The project marks a key milestone in the decarbonization of the Paris-Charles de Gaulle platform. It has been commissioned by the ADP Group, a global leader in airport operations. When completed, the heat from the doublet will supply Terminal 1 of the airport with up to 80 GWh/year of sustainable and locally produced heat. The drilling is being done using state-of-the-art drilling equipment built by
In addition to its environmental benefits, this geothermal project contributes to the local economy engaging around 75 workers on-site during the drilling and construction phases, including five roles dedicated to integration programs.
Geothermal heating has been in place at the Paris-Orly Airport since 2010. The system currently supplies 35% of the heating requirements of the airport, both for space heating and supply of hot water. Plans are in place to increase the contribution of geothermal to supply 50% of the airport’s heating needs.
“This project demonstrates the ability of geothermal energy to meet the industry’s decarbonization needs. We are proud to bring Arverne Group’s expertise to this initiative, which will enable the ADP Group to benefit from a local, renewable energy source that stabilizes its energy costs over the long term and reduces its carbon footprint. We firmly believe that underground resources, particularly geothermal energy, are key solutions for the energy transition

Vestforbrænding and Innargi have partnered to establish a 26-MW geothermal district heating project in Greater Copenhagen, Denmark.
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
The new agreement follows up on a previous engagement between the two companies to evaluate the feasibility of geothermal heating in Copenhagen.
The precise location for the facility has not been decided on yet, but the plan is for it to be located in the Lyngby-Taarbæk municipality. Seismic surveys to determine the most suitable locations for drilling are currently ongoing. Drilling is expected to start by 2026 with the target to start heat delivery by 2028.
#### Transitioning from oil and gas to geothermal
The agreement is a part of Denmark’s largest civil construction project within district heating, where 39,000 new heating customers change from oil and gas sourced heating to district heating. At the same time, the agreement brings geothermal energy to the Greater Copenhagen area for the first time, where the potential to use geothermal energy for district heating is particularly good.
Vestforbrænding is well under way with an extensive plan for 39,000 district heating customers in Ballerup, Herlev, Gladsaxe, Lyngby-Taarbæk, Furesø, Frederikssund and Egedal – all municipalities in Greater Copenhagen – to change from oil and gas sourced heating to district heating. The plan will nearly double Vestforbrænding’s heating supply and will make the network one of the largest in Denmark.
Geothermal energy is one of the new heat sources that Vestforbrænding is incorporating into the future of district heating, and it will increase heating supply security. Other new heat sources are e.g. waste heat from companies and carbon capture.
“We will need much more district heating in the future, and for district heating to come from several different sources. This will provide a robust supply and will secure stable and low prices for end users,”
“Geothermal energy fits in perfectly. When customers change from their individual heat source to district heating, they will also avoid the price dependency on a single energy source, regardless of whether it is oil, gas or electricity.”
#### Unlocking future projects
For Innargi, the agreement means the start of geothermal energy production from the geological reservoir that lies beneath most of Greater Copenhagen.
“The geological conditions to establish geothermal energy in the Greater Copenhagen area for district heating are really good. So the project is hopefully just the first of several with Vestforbrænding, which will roll out much more district heating. At the same time, we make the possibilities for the other district heating companies in Greater Copenhagen tangible, which are also expanding their network and considering alternatives to biomass,”

Deliberate well design, continuous innovation, and collaboration with industry partners is paving the way for the largest enhanced geothermal systems project.
![](
![](
![](
Beaver County, Utah may, at first glance, seem an unlikely hub for breakthrough technical and commercial innovation in geothermal energy. It lacks visible hot springs or geysers, and its remote location is not obviously conducive to supporting a large-scale logistical operation. However, geothermal startup
Fervo’s private Cape Station enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) project sits just a stone’s throw away from the U.S. Department of Energy’s
It is in this remote valley that Fervo plans to design, construct, and operate the world’s largest enhanced geothermal power facility to demonstrate that geothermal energy is a scalable and cost-effective solution ready for widespread deployment today.
#### Remote location, hard rock, and heat pose challenges
Even with the benchmark data from FORGE and experience with horizontal well drilling from Project Red, Cape Station presented a series of new challenges that required an innovative approach to logistics, project management, technology, and well optimization. Fervo set a high bar for success from the start; by the end of phase one alone, they will have drilled more than 20 wells.
From a technical standpoint, Fervo’s primary challenge consisted of drilling EGS in a remote area. Equipment must not only penetrate a difficult granite formation but also withstand temperatures on the upper end of the spectrum conventional drilling equipment can handle. Hard rock and abrasiveness characterize the granite formation, and bottomhole temperatures could reach up to 450°F (232°C).

#### Deliberate, focused efforts break records
Prior to FORGE and Cape Station, the large-scale commercial deployment of EGS had been a pipe dream. But not only did Fervo successfully drill wells, it hit its 30-day well time milestone – one that they didn’t expect to achieve until deep into field drilling – on its third well. Now, with more than 15 wells drilled, Fervo has dropped its well time to sub-20 days. Compared to Project Red, Fervo achieved a 70 percent reduction in drilling time.
Fervo’s Project Red in Nevada provided important lessons that have applied to Cape Station. The drilling team was able to capitalize on learnings from Project Red by optimizing the well design to ensure that all well construction objectives could be satisfied whilst realizing greater operational and cost efficiencies. As Fervo continues to de-risk operations, it will further optimize well designs to capitalize on learnings picked up along the way.
The prioritization of a deliberate, focused effort geared towards on-bottom drilling optimization and a scientific approach to changes also helped Fervo achieve its goals. The operator drew from approaches pioneered by Fred Dupriest, a former chief drilling engineer for ExxonMobil who provided instruction for the drilling team at FORGE [[1]]( Dupriest’s approach emphasizes the use of physics to identify and reduce performance limiters. Fervo applies Dupriest’s approach not only for drilling optimization, but also to the overall well construction process to understand where optimization opportunities exist. Through this method, Fervo identifies potential limitations and engineers those limiters out of the way.
Fervo also applied a structured, deliberate continuous-improvement approach to how it makes changes in its EGS wells. The operator acts deliberately and intentionally as it tests and evaluates operational variables to achieve desired outcomes. The desire to be intentional and more predictable drives Fervo’s approach to how it makes well construction decisions, what tools they select, and what equipment they choose, such as liner hangers and cement slurries.
“It’s a mindset,” “If you take this deliberate, calculated approach, you’re getting it right the first time, and you’re achieving ROI faster.”
Oil and gas service companies provide critical technologies, services
Traditional oil and gas operators shy away from ultra-high strength rock, but for Fervo, the ability to target these formations would prove crucial. As the leading new operator in the geothermal energy space, Fervo has leveraged relationships with service companies to help improve upon its well design and approach.
Fervo and
Halliburton also engineered a non-Portland cement blend to help ensure long-term well integrity. Fervo began with a very conservative cement design but realized they needed a new approach because of the high temperature of EGS projects. Conservative cementing formulas can be expensive. Fervo reduced costs by collaborating with Halliburton to optimize the slurry design for bottomhole circulation temperatures.
“We’ve had a lot of progress on cementing, both in terms of achieving our primary cement objectives and demonstrating that the wells, post-cementing, have the integrity that we need to complete them the way we intend,”“Working with Halliburton has provided a very quick turnaround time in terms of redesigning slurries and changing our plans as we learn more about the wells. There is not a lot of lag time between seeing an opportunity to improve and then actually closing the gap to yield the improvement.”
After the success of the liner hangers and cement, Fervo and Halliburton began to collaborate on other parts of the Cape Station wells to include Halliburton’s Baroid drilling fluids.
“We’re using a scientific approach to optimize well construction. Halliburton’s expertise in the chemistry of cement and drilling fluids and the physics of mechanical liner hangers has been a value additive to Fervo’s goals,”“Halliburton’s commitment to service quality is also a great fit for Fervo’s goals.”

#### Optimize logistics to improve efficiency and reduce costs
The remote location of Cape Station did pose logistical challenges for Fervo. Regardless of the supplier, cement slurries, liner hangers, and other products had to be shipped from distant locations to Beaver County. Cement jobs required careful planning due to their quick turnaround times.
The Halliburton team helped optimize logistics to minimize the number of trips from Bakersfield, CA where it mixed cement slurries. In cases where Fervo batch-drilled wells, it could load out cement for multiple wells instead of sending trucks for each job. This allowed Fervo to lower emissions, safety exposure, and even rig time, as it could keep the required supplies on location to immediately begin the next phase of the project.
#### Continuous refinement at Cape Station
Fervo’s methodical approach to drilling geothermal wells includes planning for contingencies and learning from challenges. They have proven the value of upfront modeling to address edge cases and plan for uncertainty, which helps ensure success during execution.
Fervo also evaluates previous project performance to identify opportunities for optimization. The decision to use Halliburton’s Bariod drilling fluids, for example, stems from a desire to further optimize drilling fluid design to effectively mitigate challenges observed in the granite interval. The ability to understand challenges, identify root causes, and address them in a way that is both sustainable and cost-effective, while ensuring long-term efficiency, requires continuous effort.
Halliburton engineered custom fluid solutions to maximize wellbore value for Fervo. The company introduced technology and services that helped Fervo reduce surface consumption by more than 80 percent and decrease defoamer usage in the production section by more than 50 percent.
Halliburton will soon collect samples from highly reactive clay zones when they are drilled for analysis and proper inhibition mechanisms. This process will allow Fervo to predict and prevent risks before they occur based on analytical and operational insights. For program continuous improvement, new lubricants are in development to mitigate future foaming risks.
“We’re building on that critical first well process and global expertise and support from Halliburton that we’ve seen with liner hangers and cementing, hoping to see to the same on the drilling fluids front to help us optimize,”
The future at Cape Station involves continuous innovation on well designs to enhance productivity and reduce well time and costs. Unlike oil and gas wells, where operators drill for oil and gas and deplete the reservoir, EGS systems do not access a commodity and shut down. The potential to improve productivity lies in drilling into deeper and hotter formations and the creation of larger bore sizes. Meanwhile, Fervo will also look for ways to optimize drilling, improve performance, and reduce cycle time.
Fervo’s success at Cape Station shows there are no remaining technical barriers to large scale EGS deployment.
By 2026, Fervo expects to start grid supply from its Cape Station project. It already signed two PPAs totaling 320 MW with Southern California Edison, and Cape Station may prove itself as the most productive EGS in history. [[2]](
“Cape Station is where EGS starts and it’s also going to be where EGS evolves and improves. We think that the area will be as consequential for geothermal as the Permian Basin is for oil and gas,”

Surface studies suggest that Grenada’s geothermal resources could support a 15-MW power plant. This indicative potential must be confirmed through test drilling, currently underway, followed by production drilling. If successful, the project could reduce the country’s reliance on diesel by up to 55%. Grenada’s primary geothermal prospects are located near Mount Saint Catherine, the island’s highest point.
In 2023, CDB approved USD 9.4 million for the Geothermal Drilling Project – Grenada, which includes drilling two exploratory wells to assess the island’s geothermal potential. In early 2024, FCDO pledged an additional £10 million to expand the drilling programme, enabling deeper and broader drilling at the same site to improve the chances of accessing a commercially viable geothermal resource.
Speaking on the significance of the agreement, the Hon. Dickon Mitchell, Prime Minister of Grenada, expressed appreciation for the additional support:
“This £10 million investment from the UK Government is a significant milestone in Grenada’s pursuit of a sustainable and resilient energy future. By harnessing our geothermal potential, we are taking a bold step towards reducing fossil fuel dependence, enhancing energy security, and creating economic opportunities for our people. This partnership reaffirms our unwavering commitment to a cleaner, more sustainable future.”

Other islands in the Eastern Caribbean are also benefiting from funding under GeoSmart. Dominica received a USD 34.8 million loan from the CDB in 2024 for a 10-MW geothermal power plant, which is now under construction. St Kitts and Nevis has similarly received funding support of USD 17 million for the drilling of geothermal production wells.

As HVAC systems grow larger and more complex, designing geothermal borefields becomes increasingly challenging. Space constraints, budget limitations, or both often add to the difficulty. By integrating a ground-source heat pump (GSHP) with other technologies—creating a hybrid heating and cooling system—we can develop a more resilient and cost-effective solution for the ever-growing complexity of modern buildings.
However, designing these systems is far from straightforward. In this webinar, we will explore the concept of geothermal potential, discuss methods for optimizing both power and energy, and demonstrate how a tool like GHEtool can help you design smarter, more efficient hybrid geothermal systems in practice.
Wouter Peere graduated in 2020 as a mechanical engineer at the Catholic University of Leuven (Belgium) with a thesis on the topic of hybrid geothermal design. After a research period of 3 years at this university, in close collaboration with Sweco, he started his own engineering firm Enead. Since 2023, Enead has been the main developer and distributor of GHEtool, a cloud-based borefield sizing tool for both small and complex geothermal systems

The
Seventeen separate blocks of buildings will be built on an area of about 200,000 square meters in the Nové Dvory neighborhood. These buildings will have an estimated heating and cooling consumption of 10,000 to 15,000 MWh per year. Moreover, an administrative building with about 8000 square meters of space to be leased will also be built, requiring an additional 300 to 500 MWh per year of heating and cooling.
Under the proposed project, energy for heating and cooling in these buildings will be supplied by pipes built within the subway tunnel D in the vicinity of the Nové Dvory station. Fluid from these pipes will then go through a heat pump to attain the target design temperature. The proposal emphasizes that heat pumps provide unparalleled efficiency, producing 3 to 5 kWh of thermal energy from 1 kWh of electricity consumed.
The geothermal system is just one component of the planned sustainable and modern environment in the neighborhood, which aims to also provide affordable rental housing, a kindergarten and elementary school, cultural center, sport facilities, and public transport lines.
“The future Nové Dvory station is a deep-cut subway station. In this case, it pays to use geothermal energy to provide heat for the urban society. Not all metro stations would have such a potential, because perhaps they do not meet the necessary depth that is needed for similar projects,”
“This is the first time that we are planning to obtain geothermal energy from the subway tunnel and use it for the production of heat or cold using a heat pump,”

The license application has been reviewed by the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization, and Climate Change, which issued a “No EIA Required” decision.
Previously licensed to AGN Petrol Inc. in 2013 but later revoked, the Konya Investment Monitoring and Coordination Presidency re-auctioned the site, awarding a new license to Konya Krom Magnesite Brick Industry in January 2023.
#### Luxury thermal tourism and agriculture
The 200-room thermal hotel will offer suites, deluxe, and family rooms, along with restaurants, a spa, a gym, a nightclub, pools, and wellness facilities.
The geothermal-powered greenhouse will enhance agricultural production, utilizing thermal water first for heating, then for hospitality services.
Authorities ensure compliance with the Geothermal Resources Law (No. 5686) and related regulations. Key measures include:
* Closed-loop geothermal system to prevent discharge into water sources.
* Sealed wells to protect aquifers.
* Geotechnical surveys before construction.
Since the project overlaps with Konya-Seydisehir State Road, a road access permit is required. Once all approvals are secured, construction and geothermal operations will accelerate.

Italian engineering and oilfield services company
The agreement is part of Saipem’s research and development program dedicated to offering technological solutions for the energy transition, including geothermal energy. The aim of the partnership is to develop advanced solutions that can enable greater use of geothermal energy, both in Italy and internationally. In particular, Saipem’s three main areas of interest are next-generation geothermal systems, offshore geothermal energy, and the reconversion of oil & gas wells.
The Memorandum of Understanding provides that the three companies will conduct joint studies on unconventional geothermal energy, i.e. terrestrial heat sources that are difficult to access and therefore still poorly exploited, and on offshore energy, which for example is abundant in the Mediterranean basin.
Saipem had previously entered a similar cooperation agreement with National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Italy.
Saipem will study the feasibility of geothermal plants, evaluating the technical solutions currently available on the market and identifying any technological gaps. Geolog and Ignis will contribute their expertise to evaluate geological formations and drilling solutions, as well as to analyze for the availability of geothermal resources. Ignis Energy is very active in several geothermal exploration projects in Türkiye and Alaska.
Geothermal energy is a strategic resource in the energy transition process as it is a reliable and continuous source of renewable energy, but still little used compared to its real potential. Saipem, thanks to its specialist skills and innovation capacity, aspires to propose reliable and innovative solutions to support the development of this sector. The company offers its vast experience in the development of conventional geothermal projects and geothermal wells carried out in Italy and internationally since the 70s, as well as in the offshore, drilling and floating plant construction sectors.

A research team led by Associate Professor Sadiq J. Zarrouk, co-director of the
Working in collaboration with water well drilling company
“The long-term vision is to make the technology low-cost and simple to implement in both new builds and existing buildings. The goal is to see it adopted widely as a clean, cost-effective energy solution,”
The technology works by drilling a shallow well near the property and running a water pipe through it. As the water flows through the pipe, it absorbs natural heat from the ground. This raises the water temperature by a few degrees, meaning less electricity is needed to heat it to the desired level – ultimately reducing overall energy use and power bills.
A special phase-change material that is used to efficiently store and distribute thermal energy will help to balance energy demand during peak usage times, according to Zarrouk.
The research team installed 15 sensors in the well to monitor temperature changes down to 20 metres below ground level. The data is being analysed using machine learning tools to help optimise the design of a second well, which is due to be drilled in the coming months.
Both wells will be monitored over the next year to better understand seasonal temperature behaviour. If results are promising, heat extraction systems will be installed to test the technology further.
“As the first study of its kind in Aotearoa New Zealand, this research has the potential to change the country’s energy use, paving the way for more sustainable and affordable heating options. If successful, the findings could provide long-term scientific and practical benefits, reducing reliance on traditional power sources,”

Drilling of a geothermal research well as part of the SCAN project of EBN and TNO has started in the De Bilt municipality in Utrecht, Netherlands.
![](

Research drilling for geothermal evaluation has started in the municipality of De Bilt in Utrecht, Netherlands. The exploration well will be drilled to a maximum depth of about 2000 meters, and drilling will take approximately 10 -12 weeks.
The drilling in De Bilt is part of the national Ouder-Amstel, Heijningen, and Heesch.
Drilling at the Utrechtseweg site in De Bilt aims to collect subsurface data on several layers which can provide information on the viability of developing geothermal resources in the northern part of Utrecth, North Holland, Flevoland, and Gelderland.

Although the research well is not meant to generate heat, it can create the basis for extracting geothermal heat in the future. This is in line with the initiative of the De Bilt municipality to transition away from natural gas and diversify its renewable energy portfolio. “We want to generate more and more green energy, but at the moment we cannot always get all the energy on the electricity grid. We are now only allowed to generate solar and wind energy. That is why every alternative form of energy generation is one to be taken seriously,”
“It really feels like looking for gold to me, because how great would it be if we could help to realize a production location with this exploratory drilling, in De Bilt or nearby?”

The the GeoTHERM expo & congress, taking place between 20 and 21 February in Offenburg, Germany.
Given every year, the Ruggero Bertani European Geothermal Innovation AwardLast year’s EGIA was awarded to Vulcan Energy for their Lithium Extraction Optimization Plant (LEOP), which extracts lithium chloride from geothermal brine which is eventually converted to battery-grade lithium hydroxide.
“We extend our heartfelt congratulations to the five exceptional nominees for the Ruggero Bertani European Geothermal Innovation Award 2025. These pioneering projects exemplify the innovation, ingenuity, and commitment needed to drive geothermal energy forward as a cornerstone of sustainable energy systems in Europe and beyond. Each finalist has contributed groundbreaking solutions that highlight the potential of geothermal technology to address pressing global energy challenges,”
![]( 2024 in Offenburg, Germany (source: GeoTHERM)
The finalists and their entries are the following:
#### Energie Baden-Württemberg (EnBW) – CASCADE
CASCADE is a new process scheme that addresses the high amount of energy and water needed by current Al-based processes for lithium extraction from geothermal brine. By using a second reactor with a Ti-/Mn-based adsorbents, the process of water can be recycled, and the energy and transportation effort is significantly reduced. Meanwhile, the purity of the second pre-product is sufficiently high to produce solid lithium salt on-site using established processes. CASCADE is a patented technology (patent number 102023118 084.3).
#### Halliburton – Truesync PMM: Geothermal Electric Submersible Pump (GeoESP) Motor
The TrueSync 738 series hybrid PMM revolutionises electric submersible pump (ESP) technology for geothermal applications, offering a blend of high performance and robust durability. TrueSync’s originality lies in its hybrid design, which ingeniously combines elements from traditional induction motor technology to overcome the limitations faced by standard permanent magnet motors. This innovation extends the operational life of ESP systems and stabilizes their performance in extreme conditions.
#### Iceland GeoSurvey (ISOR) – Flexible Coupling
The novel patented technology of Flexible Couplings has been in development within ÍSOR – Iceland GeoSurvey. Flexible Couplings are designed to mitigate casing failures in production casings of high-temperature geothermal wells, that are caused by constrained thermal expansion. By implementing Flexible Couplings in the production casing, each casing joint (around 12 m) is allowed to expand. Thermal straining of the casing is prevented, and the risk of casing failures is minimized, thereby increasing the reliability of wells. A batch of Flexible Couplings was delivered to ON Power, a subsidiary of Reykjavik Energy, in the fall of 2024 to be used in their next well drilled in Nesjavellir, Iceland, in January-March 2025.
#### Mines Paris (PSL Univeristy) – ORCHYD
ORCHYD was an H2020 project funded by the European Commission with the goal of building a prototype drilling tool that showcases an improvement of at least 4X in penetration rate compared to conventional rotary techniques while drilling deep geothermal wells. It was mainly aimed at drilling hard crystalline rocks like granites, usually found in depths beyond 4km.
The originality of the project comes from creating a fully fluid driven down the hole (DTH) system combining two mature rock breaking technologies – percussion drilling and high-pressure water jetting (HPWJ).
#### QHeat – Integration of Heating and Storage Wells to Waste Burning Facility
This project focuses on the use of Coaxial Reversible Medium-Deep Geothermal Heat Wells (MDGHWs) for a waste-to-energy facility in Finland. This innovative geothermal solution provides both heating and cooling for the facility while storing excess thermal energy for later use. While the primary focus is on waste-to-energy, the technology’s potential for cooling applications in data centres remains a concept for the future.
This project is original because it combines two innovative approaches: the use of Coaxial Reversible Medium-Deep Geothermal Heat Wells (MDGHWs) for geothermal heat extraction and storage, alongside the integration of waste heat from a biomass plant. The MDGHWs are designed to operate at deeper geothermal depths (1,000-2,000 meters), enhancing thermal extraction efficiency compared to traditional geothermal systems.

The GeoMap geothermal exploration tool by Project InnerSpace has been expanded yet again to highlight areas with geothermal development potential in India.
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
The latest addition expands upon the scope of GeoMap, which initially included Nigeria as a first case study and was then updated to encompass North America.
GeoMap™ India includes more than 175 subsurface and surface layers, including a prospecting tool to identify the most promising regions for development of geothermal powered data centers. GeoMap™ India also identifies coal power plants with the potential for conversion to geothermal power, and industrial zones that could benefit from geothermal heat networks.
GeoMap™ India highlights several regions in India that are particularly promising for geothermal development requiring higher temperatures, like for power and industrial heat production. These regions include:
* Gujarat State on India’s west coast, including the area of the Southern Cambay Basin and the major industrial zone of Jhagadia;
* Large areas of east and northeast India, particularly in the Bihar and Meghalaya States, and into the southern eastern portion of Assam;
* The Himalayan region of northwestern India;
* Through the central Son Narmada Fault Zone, one of India’s most significant tectonic areas, and the location of the Tatapani Geothermal Field;
* Along the eastern coast in the Andhra Pradesh State, along the Godavari rift, including the outskirts of Vijayawada, Andhra’s commercial hub.
To illustrate the real world impact of geothermal development in one of these promising areas, Project InnerSpace partnered with Aarti Industries, a chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturer with facilities in Jhagadia, Gujarat, on a feasibility study to examine how a geothermal conversion pilot might provide power and industrial heat to one of its facilities.
“Industrial heat is challenging to decarbonize using intermittent renewable electricity. Hence, the chemical industry, which uses a lot of industrial heat, is a hard-to-abate sector,”“Geothermal is an excellent source of clean baseload power and heat, with the potential to enable our plants to operate without disruption while also minimizing our carbon footprint. We are thrilled that GeoMap India identified the industrial zone in Jhagadia as a place where geothermal development is possible, and we look forward to exploring ways to integrate this enormous resource into our operations.”
Aside from the regions identified as top candidates for high temperature industrial heat and power development, importantly also, the entirety of India is ripe for residential and small-scale commercial geothermal heating and cooling development. This near term prospect for massively scalable and energy efficient cooling solutions could prove to be one of the most impactful geothermal opportunities to emerge in a rapidly warming world.
“The elephant in the room in a warming and changing climate is our current inability to keep people cool during heat waves, which are growing in intensity and becoming increasingly unsurvivable in some regions of the world,”
“India is soon to become the world’s most populous nation, is at increased risk of deadly heat events, and faces soaring energy demand in the coming decades. The convergence of these factors makes rapid development of geothermal for cooling in particular, a very high impact opportunity,”
Over the coming months, Project InnerSpace, along with its partners, will work to unlock the geothermal potential illustrated by GeoMap™ India. In partnership with the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), a leading think tank in Delhi, and in collaboration with academics from IIT-Guwahati, Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU), and Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, Project InnerSpace will publish the ‘Future of Geothermal In India,’ a deep dive analysis of opportunities, incentives, and supportive policies that would aid the growth and development of geothermal in India.
“As India builds a resilient energy ecosystem, geothermal technologies, which can offer firm and flexible power, are worth exploring to provide much needed diversity to the energy mix. Newer ways of tapping into geothermal can make it an important source of clean firm energy in India and help reduce the challenges of intermittency that solar and wind pose. We are actively collaborating with scientific agencies to understand the potential resources in India, and inform policy making that will help realize this potential”
Project InnerSpace will host a free webinar on Nov. 19 to explore the features of the GeoMap™ India tool. The webinar is open to all.

Adelaide-based geothermal drilling startup
“We are excited to be a part of the Industry Growth Program which helps expand the pipeline of Australia’s emerging small and medium manufacturers in the National Reconstruction Fund priority areas,”“To have this funding will immensely help us to complete additional R&D, validate our results and market these to the renewables sector.”
CoilRig has developed an innovative coiled tubing drilling rig that offers drilling operators and consumers a cost-effective solution for installing geothermal heat pumps. Unlike traditional drill rigs that require drill rods to be connected and disconnected multiple times during the drilling, CoilRig uses a continuous ‘coiled tubing’ drill pipe, which is wound onto a reel and unrolls as it drills into the ground, increasing installation efficiency and safety.
The design also reduces bending and stretching of the tubing, thus helping it last three times longer and resulting in more cost savings for rig operators.
Research into developing the new technology has been undertaken by Coilrig in partnership with researchers from the University of South Australia, Minex CRC, and other industry partners.
#### Prototype testing in 2025
The funding will go towards further product development and commercialization of the technology, including lab testing, purchasing specialised software and materials, and on-site trials and testing with their US-based customer. CoilRig is currently manufacturing its first prototype in Adelaide, which will be exported to New York State in 2025 after simulated field testing and trials.
According to Director and Co-Founder of CoilRig, Soren Soe, the biggest barrier to adopting geothermal energy in buildings is the cost of drilling. “The cost of drilling can make up to 50% of the total installation costs. This is where CoilRig can provide customers with a distinct and competitive advantage, as our drilling rigs offer increased efficiency and effectiveness due to the innovative components designed by our team.”
Shane Fox, Engineering Manager at CoilRig, emphasizes that the technology is unique to the Australian industry. “We have developed coiled tubing drilling equipment for the minerals industry, but this has never been done in Australia for the geothermal industry. Once we have demonstrated these results – and validated them in a simulated field trial –we can utilise this data to develop future rigs.”

The
The six-month initiative will examine the workforce requirements across the geothermal development cycle from exploration to power plant operation. It will identify opportunities for skills development in project management, engineering and technical, environmental and social monitoring, community engagement, and regulatory oversight.
The partnership comes at an opportune time as Dominica prepares to start construction of a 10-MW geothermal power plant. Just recently, Dominica secured a USD 34 million loan from the Caribbean Development Bank to help fund the construction. This will be the first geothermal power plant in the independent OECS and in the Caribbean Community, following 38 years of power generation from geothermal sources in neighbouring Guadeloupe.

“This collaboration comes at a critical moment in our region’s energy transition. With multiple geothermal projects moving forward simultaneously at varying stages of development, we must ensure our people have the skills and education to develop and manage these resources effectively. We cannot rely indefinitely on external expertise,”
#### Building geothermal expertise in the Caribbean region
FRENZ is delivered by Cowater International, in association with JRG Energy and Elemental Group. The FRENZ team will deliver the technical assistance, drawing on New Zealand’s extensive experience in geothermal energy development. Their final action plan will provide a detailed framework for building sustainable capacity in the OECS geothermal energy sector.
The initiative builds on nearly a decade of New Zealand’s engagement in Caribbean geothermal development and represents a significant step forward in the region’s transition to renewable energy. The resulting action plan will inform future capacity-building initiatives under the OECS GEOBUILD Programme and help ensure the long-term sustainability of geothermal projects across the OECS.
The geothermal sector presents unique challenges for workforce development in small island states. Projects take years to develop, and opportunities for hands-on experience are limited. The collaboration with FRENZ is intended to help OECS GEOBUILD identify creative ways to build and maintain expertise even as projects progress at different speeds across different islands.
“It is a pleasure to continue our working relationship with the OECS and build on our knowledge of geothermal energy development in the Caribbean. This activity will provide a great foundation for moving towards a sustainable geothermal industry in the region,”

# Interview – How Gradient Geothermal taps into the geothermal potential of oilfields

![ ](
![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 13 Jan 2025
In this interview, Benjamin Burke of Gradient Geothermal tells us about geothermal power production in oilfields using proprietary technologies.
![](
![](
![](
A lot has already been said about high drilling costs and resource discovery risk being two of the major barriers to widespread adoption of geothermal. Colorado-based
The company had recently announced the deployment of their HXC Geothermal System technology to generate geothermal power at the oil and gas assets of Chord Energy in North Dakota. Sufficiently intrigued, we caught up with Benjamin Burke
#### Harnessing the geothermal energy of oil and gas fields
The business of Gradient Geothermal (Gradient) can be briefly summarized as the deployment of modular, mobile geothermal units into oil fields to generate power and provide cooling services. This fulfills two objectives – fluid cooling, which consumes a lot of power in oil and gas production, and geothermal power generation. With the technology of Gradient, operators can benefit from carbon emissions reduction, reduced utility costs, and the availability of a more resilient power source.
“In either case, we generate power, but we can really flexibly meet the goals of our clients,”“Geothermal is a great vehicle for them to achieve all those goals.”
“For most of our clients, the geothermal power they generate on site means that they are consuming less from the grid, or will need to generate less power from diesel or natural gas. There is value in terms of both offsetting carbon emissions and having affordable and reliable power generated onsite.
Gradient is also exploring the possibility of supplying heat from their technology under a cascading use model, where residual heat from power generation can be utilized by the operator or a partner. A partner under this model can be in the industry of agribusiness, aquaculture, industrial drying, or any of a number of conventional direct heat users. There is a limitation in that these facilities have to be located close to the oilfield, but the company is looking forward to partner with different industries.
#### Flexible and easy-to-deploy technology
The patented HXC sled is at the heart of the oilfield solutions that Gradient is offering. The sled comprises a heat exchanger, an ORC unit, and a dry cooler. The system was designed to be modular, ruggedized, and able to handle different types of fluid with no pre-treatment requirements. This allows the technology to be deployed in challenging fluid conditions, or even in temperatures that are not very high.
“We do work with our clients on a pre-qualification process, but the hurdle is not terribly high,”
![]( of the HXC Geothermal System by Gradient Geothermal (source: Gradient Geothermal)
The preferred areas for power generation have temperatures of over 200 °F (93 °C), but the technology can work with temperatures of at least 165 °F (74 °C). In terms of flowrate, Gradient needs at least about 2000 barrels per day, or equivalent to 3.2 liters per second for power generation. In case flowrate from one well is not sufficient, flow from several wells in an oilfield can be aggregated to satisfy this requirement. Gradient works at oil and gas wells as well as central facilities in cases where multiple wells are used. However, this may present new challenges.
“Gathering fluids far from the wellbore can result in heat loss, so we work with clients to help them understand where heat loss is occurring. If fluid aggregation is a really important aspect of the project, then we work with them to help insulate the system.”
The technology is also not selective in terms of the water cut of the fluids. “We can use 100% water. We could use 100% oil or gas. We could use any ratio in between,”
The heat exchanger is the only direct point of contact between the HXC sled and the well fluids. It can handle whatever is in the fluid stream from the oilfield, whether gas or solids, and thus protects all other components of the HXC sled. In general, oilfield operators treat their fluids to mitigate scaling or precipitate out undesired minerals. Whatever chemical programs the operator may implement works well with Gradient’s technology.
“If it works for the operator, then it’s good for us. The fluid does not need to go under any special pre-treatment for our equipment.”
In terms of deployment time, initial assessment for new clients can take between one to three months depending on how fast the client would like to move. Once the unit has been customized and ready to be deployed, setting up on site takes only one day. The system can start running fairly quickly, both on the electrical side and the fluid plumbing side.
#### Lessons from the Blackburn site and future plans
The initial project of Gradient at the Blackburn site in Nevada operated from May 2022 to April 2024. The unit from the Blackburn site has since been transferred to North Dakota, but the Blackburn site is still active as part of the US Department of Energy Blackburn Wells of Opportunity study. This is a three-phase project with the Department of Energy which has now just moved to the second phase, which involves procurement, installation, and commissioning.
The Blackburn site is a conventional mature oil field that was discovered in the 1980s and is now over 99% water flow. There are a lot of a lot of oil fields like it around the world and in the US. The Blackburn project was a valuable learning experience for Gradient in terms of anticipating the surface infrastructure needed to scale up an oil field for geothermal power generation.
“Geothermal needs more thermal mass flow, and so there are fluid gathering systems, tanks, and separation vessels to consider,“We also had to consider the existing infrastructure in the field. Some of it may only need to be augmented rather than be replaced. Going through all these factors with the operator and looking at what can be augmented or replaced was a really big learning for us, and we are excited to share this with the public.”

Throughout the course of the feasibility study in Blackburn, several trials were done to optimize power generation of the 175-kW nameplate unit on site. At maximum power generation, the team was able to attain about 2/3 of the capacity of the power generation unit. The next goal for Gradient is to scale up the flow and optimize the location of the unit to attain 250 kw of net power generation or just over 300 kW of gross power generation.
The mission for the Blackburn project is to demonstrate the pathway to 1 MW geothermal power generation in an existing oilfield. Gradient has done plenty of surface and subsurface work to document the various scenarios and challenges taking oilfields across the US and scaling them up for geothermal production, or for an end-of-life oilfield to continue on as a geothermal field. “We’ve learned a ton and we are excited to share that with the DOE and the public as we go forward,”
#### Projects in North Dakota
As mentioned, Gradient has since deployed their technology at an oilfield in North Dakota operated by Chord Energy. However, the company has also started work with other operators in the Basin region.
With these new projects, Gradient continues to gain more experience that help improve their technologies and processes. For instance, working with new wells can be very different from working with wells that have been around for more than 40 years. “In some cases, you can get a lot of sand flow or other kinds of debris flowing up new wells. Learning how to handle solids has been a big part of our experience.”
“Our units are very adaptable. We have no problem handling abrupt changes in flow rates and temperatures.”
Working in extremely cold conditions with geothermal fluids at temperatures below 0 °C also meant that the team had to be ready for freezing conditions in case of discontinuous flow. “The same challenges that other operators find in North Dakota in the oil and gas realm are going to be geothermal challenges as well. Everything’s great when the whole system is hot, but if the site has to shut in for a while, you have to be ready for freezing conditions. We had to work to make sure our unit was ready for those with glycol in the HXC.”
#### What else is in the future for Gradient Geothermal?
Gradient has some other projects currently in the pre-operations phase outside the United States. Within the US, the company is particularly excited about a thermal energy network project in Pierce, Colorado, for which Gradient received a grant from the state energy office.
Gradient will be doing a feasibility study in the town of Pierce, a small eastern plains town that has hosted an oil field since 1951. That oilfield has been played out, and now the operator is looking for another life for the field. Thus, there is an opportunity to utilize the oilfield to provide heat to local residents and businesses. This is an example where there is a very large direct thermal energy opportunity.
Additionally, the company is looking into other realms as part of their larger business plan. The company is considering going beyond the business of leasing their technology, and possibly growing into owning and operating oilfields, power facilities, and selling electricity to the grid or directly to end-users through PPAs.

#### Focusing on technology that already exists
Burke states that in the US alone, there are just under 2.9 million wells that are both currently operating and wells that have operated that can be re-entered. Of that, about a half million are wells that have the wellbore integrity and the heat and flowrate, possibly through aggregation, for geothermal power generation. This amounts to electricity generation potential of about 13 GW.
“We look not only at individual wells, but individual field opportunities,”“That really covers the whole US, from the Appalachian Basin in the east, to the entire Gulf Coast Basin. There are a number of basins in the Midwest, from Oklahoma all the way up to North Dakota, smaller Rockies basins and out into California and parts of Nevada.”
“That’s just thinking from a stable power generation standpoint. When we bring fluid cooling into the models, then more wells and more opportunities come forward. There are also similar geologic conditions in Canada, and in parts of South America and Africa.
“We see a really rosy future for sedimentary geothermal or oilfield geothermal, if you will. The repeatability across the world is quite strong.”
Low-temperature geothermal is also increasingly becoming more accessible with improving capabilities and lower prices of ORC units. Equipment costs have come down significantly in the last 10 or 15 years, providing more opportunities to harness geothermal resources at lower than 74 °C.
“It’s very exciting what the geothermal industry is doing with efforts to tap into ultradeep and ultra hot resources. That ecosystem of innovation is fantastic,”“Low-temperature geothermal is the market niche that we have staked for ourselves, and we’re similarly excited about what we can do with this technology.”
According to Burke, it was a concerted business decision to focus on technologies that already exist and are already well-established. “We wanted to tell our investors that we are ready to go now. The technology is here now. This is not a science project. We can go out and generate electrons.”

The collaboration will allow ABB to support Sage’s agreement with Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, to deliver up to 150 MW of geothermal baseload power at a location east of the Rocky Mountains in the US. The first phase of the project is expected to be operational by 2027.
Within the main MoU scope, ABB will investigate how its automation, electrification and digital technology can be deployed at geothermal sites around the world, to maximize energy efficiency and reliability. This may include supplying a distributed control system (DCS), electrical infrastructure architecture, and digital solutions such as asset performance management, process optimization and cybersecurity systems.
The partnership also has the potential to develop solutions for Sage’s energy storage technology, which can be paired with intermittent renewable resources such as solar and wind.
![]( Geosystems‘ Geopressured Geothermal System (GGS) energy storage facility (source: Sage)
“We are focused on scaling our proprietary Geopressured Geothermal Systems (GGS) technology and our partnership with ABB will advance the widespread deployment of next-generation geothermal,”“Unlike traditional renewable energy sources, geothermal solutions, including energy storage and baseload power generation, can provide an on-demand source of clean energy that is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.”
The GGS process involves pumping fluid at pressure into a man-made subsurface reservoir. After the stored water is heated to more than 150°C and, leveraging pressure or mechanical energy, it can be released back to the surface to pass through heat exchangers and turbines to generate electricity.
“To be able to exploit the potential of geothermal energy to enable a low-carbon society, we need cross-industry collaborations to drive advancements in the technology,” “Sage’s GGS offers the ability to produce low carbon electricity, as well as an energy storage solution, and can play an important role in the energy transition alongside other measures.”

Enel Green Power has been granted a 20-year extension to their geothermal concessions in Tuscany, Italy until 2046, paving the way for further growth.
![](
![](
![](
After a very long period of negotiations, the regional council of Tuscany, Italy has approved the 20-year extension for the geothermal concessions held by
“With the renewal of this concession, Tuscany consolidates itself as a green region that focuses on sustainability, moving from covering, with geothermal production, no longer 34% of our energy consumption, but 37-38%,”
Enel currently has 34 geothermal power plants in the Tuscany region. Eight of these geothermal concessions were set to expire by 2024, but the company was given a one-year extension until 31 December 2025. The decision was highly criticized, as the one-year extension was not compatible with the investment horizon for geothermal projects.
In late 2023, Enel presented a EUR 3 billion investment plan for Italy’s geothermal sector, with plans of building two new power plants by 2030. However, the plan was contingent on the company receiving a substantial extension on their existing concessions.
Over the next months, the regional council requested the geothermal developer and operator to present plans and timetables for maintenance and technological improvement to guarantee the efficiency of the power plants. The investment plan will also include EUR 30 million in contributions per year for the municipalities, which will then go towards the building of roads, schools, and sports facilities.
This is a positive development for Italy’s geothermal sector, which has been at a standstill for about a decade.

The Colombian National Government announces that it expects to start the first round of bidding for geothermal projects in the country. The call will offer seven areas with high geothermal potential, located in volcanic regions of the Western and Central Cordillera, where the
Although it had already been announced in 2024, the president of the
“Over the last few years we have conducted studies with resources from the ANH and the Colombian Geological Service, in addition to establishing regulations with the Ministry of Mines and Energy. We now have the necessary elements to begin these processes,”
### The seven areas to be auctioned in the first round are:
* Paipa (Boyacá)
* Iza (Boyacá)
* Machin Volcano (Tolima)
* Azufral Volcano (Nariño)
* San Diego (Caldas)
* Villamaria (Caldas)
* Sibundoy (Putumayo)
The Ministry of Mines and Energy highlights that the participation of two types of investors in the auction is expected: exploration developers and EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) companies, responsible for the construction and operation of the projects.
#### Geothermal potential in Colombia
The Colombian Geological Service has identified several areas with high geothermal potential in different regions of the country. Geothermal energy in Colombia can be developed both in sedimentary basins and in magmatic areas.
The National Government has established a regulatory framework that will allow the initiation of reconnaissance and prospecting activities, necessary to confirm the viability of geothermal resources. These measures seek to strengthen the technical capacity in the exploration and exploitation of the resource, with a focus on geological studies, drilling and reservoir modeling.
“We have identified the country’s geothermal potential and we have the regulations to begin the first rounds of exploration. We hope that this year geothermal energy will advance significantly in Colombia,”
With this auction, Colombia seeks to consolidate geothermal energy as a viable energy source within its energy portfolio, promoting its exploration and development based on geological knowledge and available technologies.

The project was presented during the 14th Lauter Energy Forum, “Heat of the Future – Potential of Deep Geothermal Energy.” With this, SWK takes a step towards it goal of achieving 100% renewable energy generation by 2040.
“We are pleased that, after intensive preparation, we have reached an important milestone,”
“The use of virtually inexhaustible and continuously available geothermal energy is particularly interesting for municipal heat planning,
The Kaiserslautern area is believed to have potential for hydrothermal geothermal energy. However, there are not many reference projects in this region. Based on existing knowledge, the potential target for exploitation would be the Rotliegend, a sandstone layer at approximately 2300 to 3300 meters depth. Initial assessment suggests that deep water with temperatures of around 100 °C can be found.

SWK still needs to secure the necessary permits, but seismic exploration of the study site is scheduled to begin by the fall of this year. 3D seismic measurements will be done throughout the 143-km2
If the results of the investigations are positive, then SWK plans to build a geothermal plant and eventually supply environment-friendly and fuel-independent heat for the district heating network.
The company also holds the license for the Kasimir concessions field to the northwest. There are no concrete plans for Kasimir yet, as work has already began on Lutrina. It is nevertheless an area of interest for SWK, notably as there is also interest in the site from private-sector project developers.

U.S. based Syntholene Energy Corp reports having signed a binding energy agreement securing 20 MW of geothermal power, a major milestone in deploying the world’s first geothermally-powered synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) plant module.
This agreement will power a commercial demonstration facility, integrating geothermal heat and electricity for high-temperature steam electrolysis, improving the efficiency of power-to-fuel technology. The facility will produce synthetic kerosene, addressing the growing demand for carbon-neutral aviation fuel.
#### A first-of-its-kind hybrid energy approach
Unlike traditional geothermal power plants that focus solely on electricity generation, this facility will utilize both heat and electricity, demonstrating a new model for industrial-scale geothermal applications.
There are key benefits to geothermal-powered eSAF production, such as base-load clean energy for fuel synthesis, Carbon-neutral industrial heat utilization, and scalability from demonstration to commercial output.
#### Strategic partnership & expansion potential
Under the binding Letter of Intent (LOI), Syntholene will design, engineer, and operate the facility at a partner-controlled geothermal site, retaining exclusive rights to technology and project expansion.
The agreement also includes a commercial expansion option, allowing up to 20 MW of geothermal capacity for future large-scale production.
“This energy agreement represents the seeds of a transformative moment for synthetic fuel cost and scalability,”
#### Geothermal: a game-changer for industrial heat applications
Geothermal energy has long been underutilized in heat-intensive industrial processes. By leveraging geothermal heat for fuel synthesis, Syntholene is setting a precedent for more efficient, carbon-neutral industrial applications.
If successful, this model could pave the way for other industrial sectors to utilize geothermal resources for low-emission manufacturing processes.
#### Looking ahead: the future of geothermal-powered fuels
This project positions geothermal energy at the forefront of clean fuel innovation, bridging the gap between renewable energy and sustainable aviation. As Syntholene advances to full-scale commercial production, it will be a key player in decarbonizing aviation and heavy transportation.
The company names El Salvador and Iceland as project sites. There is no clear indication where this agreement was signed, but it seems not likely to be in Europe.

Essity is the only tissue manufacturer in New Zealand that makes its paper on site and converts it to finished products. The facility manufactures products for brands such as Sorbent, Tork, Purex, and Handee.
With the conversion to geothermal steam, the carbon footprint of the Kawerau mill has been reduced since 2009, with another 25% reduction because of the recent technology upgrade. According to Sid Takla, Australasia Managing Director of Essity, this is equivalent to “removing 2200 cars from the road annually.”
We had first reported on the initiative of Essity to convert to geothermal steam back in 2021. Takla added that the company had invested $20 million to upgrade its paper machine. Geothermal steam is being supplied by the company’s partner and supplier Ngati Tuwharetoa Geothermal.
“The geothermal reservoir and the infrastructure in place through Ng?ti T?wharetoa Geothermal are unique to Kawerau, and we are so pleased to invest more into this smart, natural solution. Beyond the positive environmental impact, the project also delivers socio-economic benefits to the local economy with the partnership helping to fund local marae, housing, and education initiatives,”
“By replacing fossil fuels with geothermal steam, this project demonstrates how New Zealand businesses can achieve energy security while significantly reducing carbon emissions,”

A new report by the Rhodium Group (
The report emphasises enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) and sees the potential that EGS ould supply up to 64% of projected data center demand growth by the early 2030s, and in optimal conditions, 100% of demand at lower costs than conventional grid electricity.
The AI-driven surge in electricity demand
The expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing is pushing electricity consumption to unprecedented levels. The report notes that:
* Data centers’ share of U.S. electricity consumption has grown from 2% in 2020 to 4.5% in 2024.
* By 2028, data centers could account for 7-12% of total electricity demand, stressing the power grid.
* AI training models, including ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Meta AI, are primary drivers of this surge.
As utilities struggle to expand power generation capacity, geothermal energy is emerging as a viable 24/7 solution to support data center growth.
Geothermal’s key advantages for data centers
The report identifies several reasons why geothermal energy is a strong candidate for powering AI-driven data centers:
* High Reliability – Unlike wind and solar, geothermal operates 24/7 with a capacity factor above 90%.
* Lower Costs – Locating data centers near geothermal resources could reduce electricity costs by 31-45%.
* Reduced Carbon Footprint – Geothermal provides firm, zero-carbon energy, helping companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google meet their clean energy targets.
Overcoming Barriers to Geothermal Expansion
To fully realize geothermal’s potential for data centers, the report outlines key challenges:
* Permitting Delays – Federal approvals for geothermal projects can take 7-10 years, hindering development.
* Grid Connection Bottlenecks – Many geothermal projects face long wait times for interconnection.
* Financing Gaps – Despite its potential, geothermal still faces funding challenges compared to solar and wind.
The report urges policymakers and tech companies to support regulatory reforms, investment incentives, and faster permitting to accelerate geothermal adoption.
The path forward: geothermal-driven data centers
If AI companies prioritize siting data centers near geothermal resources, geothermal energy could meet 100% of projected demand growth while cutting costs and emissions.
With strong policy support and industry investment, geothermal could become a cornerstone of sustainable AI infrastructure, ensuring energy security and clean growth in the digital era.

JOGMEC has initiated a project called “High-Efficiency High-Density Geothermal Exploration Technology – Development of a New Exploration Method Using Elastic Waves” and thus developed a technology to measure microtremors generated by passive sources (wind, waves, vehicles, etc.) to identify structures where geothermal fluid may exist.
The microtremor array exploration method is a technology that estimates the underground S-wave velocity structure and does not require an artificial seismic source. The sensor is small and the number of measurement points can be easily increased, making it a more affordable and flexible exploration method.
Although JOGMEC had already identified promising areas to test the technology, several issues were also identified that must be resolved before commercialization. Therefore, this technology development project aims to resolve these issues and help establish an exploration method using microseismic technology.
JOGMEC has played an instrumental role in the exploration and development of geothermal power projects in Japan, annually releasing grants for geothermal exploration, drilling, and power plant construction.

The end of the year is upon us again, and so our team at ThinkGeoEnergy will again be taking a holiday break to recuperate and spend time with our loved ones. Our last newsletter for the year will be coming out on the 17th of December. We will then be back with our daily news reporting on 6 January, and the next newsletter will come out on 14 January.
We are excited to share with our readers our comprehensive Global Geothermal Power Update report at the start of 2025, showcasing the outcomes of our efforts on market research and intelligence. We will, of course, be releasing our usual Top 10 geothermal countries, as well as the list of the Top 10 most popular news stories of the year.
This past year, we have focused on engaging with the geothermal in more creative ways. This typically took the form of doing video interviews from the events we have covered, thus giving the spotlight to the people and groups making geothermal happen around the world. We have uploaded more than 50 of these videos
There is a perpetual pipeline of these interviews to be published, so definitely watch out for more from us.
![]( interviews of various geothermal personalities available at the ThinkGeoEnergy YouTube channel
Another outcome of this drive to diversify our content is our partnership with Baseload Capital for GeoTV, a YouTube news show that aims to deliver insights and updates on the geothermal world with more casual and dynamic content. GeoTV has covered a lot of ground in the four episodes that we have released this year.
We continue to have growing presence in social media, with increased following on both LinkedIn and Instagram. We will continue to focus on these platforms, providing content that takes into context the modern audience’s content consumption behavior and preference. It is clear that one must be constantly on their toes in a rapidly changing media landscape. This applies to us as well.
And we will not let the year end without giving a massive THANK YOU
With that, the ThinkGeoEnergy team with

# Te Huka 3 geothermal power station in New Zealand starts grid supply

Commissioning has started for the Te Huka 3 geothermal power plant in New Zealand, targeting operations at 51.4-MW capacity by the end of 2024.
![](

The testing period will then be followed by formal generator compliance testing to Transpower’s system operator code requirements to confirm Te Huka 3 can provide electricity to the grid efficiently and safely. Te Huka 3 is expected to be fully online by the end of 2024.
First announced in 2022, Te Huka 3 was built with an investment of NZ$300 million and is designed to be one of the first 100% carbon-neutral geothermal power stations in the world. The binary cycle power station uses a process where geothermal fluid is split into steam and liquid, which are then both utilized to heat up the pentane to drive the turbine. All of the site’s potential emissions will be reinjected back into the reservoir.
“This marks a huge moment for the team at Te Huka 3, who have, for the past two years, worked tirelessly from the initial ground-breaking on site to building a fully operational renewable power station. That is no mean feat,”
“It’s a really exciting time for geothermal energy,”“It’s often been the unsung hero of power, but now it is really coming into its own as it plays a crucial role in New Zealand’s transition away from fossil fuels while helping to keep the lights on.”
Te Huka 3 will thus be the second geothermal power station that Contact Energy brings online this year, following the commissioning of Tauhara in August. Together, the two facilities will have a combined installed capacity of 203.4 MW, which will be a very significant contribution to the total global installed geothermal power capacity for this year.

A recent webinar by the DeepU project examines the state of geothermal deep drilling technologies and showcased the potential of laser drilling.
![](

![](
![](
Traditional drilling methods primarily rely on mechanical force, utilising a rotatory system to grind and crush rock – a process that can be both time-consuming and costly. To overcome these limitations, thepower of laser energy combined with cryogenic gas
The overall aim of DeepU
The proposed technology is being tested at the laboratory scale in different rock types to verify its ability to liquefy and vitrify rock, ensuring the borehole is ready for heat exchange immediately after drilling. Laboratory demonstrations provide crucial data to assess the technological, environmental and economic sustainability of the proposed solution, while also defining its potential and commercial viability.
The high-risk innovation presented in DeepU has the potential to make geothermal energy system accessible everywhere in a targeted and demand-oriented manner, offering a complementary approach and an alternative solution to traditional energy storage and production, decentralising the power supply also in areas where this is currently deemed uneconomic.
DeepU has been funded by the European Commission under the EIC Pathfinder Programme (G.A. 101046937) as part of Horizon Europe. Eng. Luc Pockelé coordinates the project from the RED srl in collaboration with partners from four countries: the University of Padua (Italy), Prevent GmbH (Germany), Fraunhofer IAPT (Germany), GeoServ (Ireland), The Wroclaw University of Science and Technology (Poland), and the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche IGG (Italy). The project will run until October 2025.
#### Does deep drilling need a revolution?
Just recently, the DeepU project held a webinar titled “Does deep drilling need a revolution?”deep drilling technologies while initiating a discussion on the breakthroughs necessary to access ultra-deep geothermal resources. Central to the conversation was the pioneering technology proposed by DeepU – its approach combines high-power lasers and cryogenic gas to penetrate the most challenging rock formations.
The project partners showcased cutting-edge, innovative drilling technologies while emphasizing the advantages of non-mechanical drilling. They shared significant findings from the DeepU project that demonstrate, on a laboratory level, the potential of laser drilling technology to address the limitations of conventional methods.
The research investigates how lasers interact with rock, revealing that thermal spallation, melting, and vaporization occur simultaneously, albeit with varying intensities based on rock type, power density, and irradiation duration. Notably, thermal spallation is the most promising to produce usable diameter wells, with drilling rates ranging from 5 to 15 meters per hour.
The team has selected supercritical nitrogen as the flushing medium for deep borehole drilling due to its thermodynamic properties and effectiveness in removing cuttings. They developed a numerical model to determine the necessary pressure and flow rates for different borehole depths, which is being validated through a dedicated test rig.
The proposed system involves storing liquid nitrogen, compressing it to high pressures (up to 350 bars), and delivering it down the borehole through a specially designed channel with vacuum insulation. Among the challenges discussed regarding the technology is the need for integration with existing drilling equipment and practices.

The
PULSE was created as part of the activities celebrating the 25th anniversary of INGV, with the contribution of the IRGIE Project (Inventory of Geothermal Resources of the Aeolian Islands) and in collaboration with the artistic collective LIMINAL STATE.
“With PULSE we want to offer the public, young and old, and the scientific community an innovative tool to ‘see’ and ‘feel’ the energy contained within Planet Earth,”
The PULSE exhibition will be inaugurated on 21 March with a dedicated program for schools, researchers, and the general public.
#### A multimedia showcase of geothermal
The PULSE installation is made up of two parts. The first is an external digital sculpture made of two large LED screen on which videos and images will tell the story of geothermal heat from its deep original to surface manifestations such as geysers, fumaroles, and hot springs. The second area will showcase the applications of geothermal energy in Italy and the its role in the energy transition.
A centerpiece of the exhibition is the simulation of a fumarolic event that offers a unique multisensory experience showing the natural phenomena in geothermal areas.
Another part of the exhibition displays rocks collected from 1000 meters deep from the geothermal reservoirs of the Larderello fields, the oldest geothermal complex in the world. The geothermal power plants in Larderello are operated by Enel Green Power, who also provided the rocks for the exhibition.
Although Italy remains a major player in the global geothermal power sector, the industry has remained stagnant for the last decade owing to insufficient regulatory and market support. However, positive developments have happened in recent months, including the 20-year extension of the geothermal concessions of Enel Green Power, paving the way for further investment.

The Geothermal Data Repository under the US Department of Energy have released AskGDR, improving accessibility and discoverability of public geothermal data.

The team behind the
Managed by DOE’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the GDR provides free, universal access to all relevant data generated from projects funded by the Geothermal Technologies Office (GTO) and supporting partners. For more than ten years, data from these projects were uploaded to the GDR for public use, resulting in 1,268 datasets and 287 TB of data.
As more data is uploaded to the site, the GDR team addresses accessibility at multiple levels, and the ability to discover the data is just the first step.
“A deeper level of accessibility is being able to use the data in a meaningful way, making sure that all the necessary contextual information is there to use the data effectively,”
The AskGDR virtual research assistant allows users to access relevant datasets and supporting documents by making more intuitive queries, and not just keyword searches.
#### Making geothermal data available to all
This latest measure is part of one of the objectives of GDR – to ensure that geothermal data is available to people and communities regardless of location or sector. Another level of accessibility is the integration of GDR with DOE’s Open Energy Data Initiative (OEDI), which allows massive datasets to live in the cloud.
“By putting these large data sets in the cloud, we’ve made them truly accessible. Previously when working with big data, you were inadvertently limiting your ability to collaborate to institutions that could handle that, like a large lab or a Fortune 500 company,”
“But now because the GDR is integrated with OEDI, it’s in the cloud and that opens the door for a wider array of institutions and organizations like smaller universities, high schools, startup companies and other sources of innovation.”
By facilitating equal accessibility, the GDR can support historically under-resourced communities as well as those that lack access to larger scientific communities. Making this information public and free to download means that the data collected in one community can help another explore sustainable and clean energy resources.
Through the GDR, GTO is meeting its commitment to data accessibility and continually improving ways to find and use data more quickly, broadly, and efficiently. This directory houses data with far-reaching impact, fueling innovation, promoting scientific discovery, and supporting the global scientific community.

# Redefining geothermal power generation with the Plain Bearings Turbine (PBT)

![ ](
![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 14 Oct 2024
The new Plain Bearings Turbine (PBT) by Ormat aims to make geothermal power plants more efficient, simplify maintenance, and reduce downtime.
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
![](
Global geothermal developer and operator and technology leader
With this new addition in their portfolio, Ormat is again pushing the boundaries of technology to contribute to the growth of the geothermal power generation sector.
To learn more about the PBT and the operating principles behind it, we spoke with Nirit Grushko, Senior VP of Innovation, R&D, and Engineering and Alex Katz, Senior R&D Engineer of Ormat.
#### Simplified maintenance and reduced downtime
The value proposition of the PBT is quite simple and straightforward – it is a turbine that requires maintenance only once in 10 years. Even when maintenance has to be done, the new design allows it to be done much simpler and quicker than industry standards.
What is about the PBT that gives it this advantage? A standard overhung turbine has a set of bearings located on the generator side. To service or replace those bearings during maintenance, the turbine must be opened. While performed only every few years, this job requires substantial downtime.
In contrast, the PBT has both bearing assemblies located at points of the turbine that can be accessed externally. The PBT also makes use of robust hydrodynamic bearings (instead of the standard roller bearings), which theoretically will outlive the standard life of geothermal power plants.
The mechanical seal of the turbine – also one of its common points of failure – is also externally accessible. In addition, the design exposes the seal to lower temperatures, thus extending its useful life.
![]( of turbine (source: Ormat)
The result is a turbine that can undergo maintenance only once every 10 years, instead of the standard 4 to 7 years recommended for standard turbines. This period can be stretched out longer if there are no indicators that the turbine needs maintenance.
Another gain from the design is that the turbine no longer needs to be evacuated during maintenance. This is crucial when handling the binary fluid medium in ORC power plants. Not only does this avoid potential emissions of hydrocarbon compounds, but also makes the maintenance process easier for personnel
#### More flexible operations
Although designed for ORC power plants, the higher capacity, ease of maintenance, and efficiency of the PBT mean that it can compete with steam turbines.
The capacity of the PBT caps at 50 MW, mostly because two of these reach the limit of the generators used in the binary market. However, smaller capacity PBTs can be supplied. Ormat currently has a prototype with an installed nominal power capacity of only 5 MW.
Whereas most turbines currently in the market support a maximum of 5 stages, the PBT design expands this possibility to 7 stages. This provides additional operational flexibility suitable to a wider geothermal market.
Ormat is currently focusing on targeting the high-temperature geothermal market, such as in Indonesia and New Zealand, for the PBT. This is a bold move as ORC turbines are typically utilized for low-temperature geothermal resources or the residual heat from the bottom stream of a steam turbine.
#### Innovation as an iterative process
As a vertically integrated geothermal company with decades of experience, Ormat’s dual roles as an operator and engineering company have both played crucial roles in coming up with innovative products like the PBT.
“As an operator, all the things that hurt our customers hurt us as well. These include downtimes, maintenance, accessibility, time to evacuate, and emissions,”
![]( Diablo 4 geothermal power plant, Mammoth Complex, California (source: Ormat)
As a provider of technology and engineering solutions, Ormat develops products that build upon older products and lessons. In the case of the PBT, the design was based on improvements of at least two of their older turbine designs. By taking inspiration and lessons from past products, Ormat is able to refine the designs and take advantage of this iterative loop of innovations and constant improvement.
#### “If the challenge is easy, then it’s not a challenge.”
“Ormat has been around now for over 60 years, and we want to still be the leading company in geothermal for the next 60 years,”
“To keep our engineers curious, engaged, and motivated, we need to give them challenges. And if the challenge is easy, then it’s not a challenge,”
The company presents its engineers with a major challenge that initially seems impossible to achieve. To support them, they are provided with various tools, including training in systematic innovation thinking, design and entrepreneurial thinking, attendance at conferences, participation in roundtable discussions, and brainstorming sessions. This culture of continuous learning and collaboration was key to making the groundbreaking turbine design a reality.
#### Reducing the costs of geothermal
The new PBT is part of Ormat’s campaign to make geothermal more competitive by reducing costs. This not only involves reducing drilling costs, but also making power plants more efficient and reducing costs associated to manufacturing, design, and construction.
Ormat maintains a very active pipeline of R & D projects addressing just about very major engineering challenge in geothermal. With its global footprint, access to different geothermal markets, and a company culture built on innovation, we likely will hear more groundbreaking product launches from Ormat in the near future.

A growing geothermal industry will need more drillers to reach its goals. The discipline of geothermal well construction also needs robust and universal standards, better project management, and technological innovations.
We interviewed Kevin Gray and Daria Ivakhnenko to learn more about Black Reiver’s role in the geothermal industry and their sentiment on Ukraine’s geothermal potential.
#### Improving the standards of geothermal drilling
Thirteen years ago, Black Reiver was founded to provide petroleum expertise and training. Kevin is approaching 35 years of experience in drilling, while Daria has over 20 years of experience in technical translation, training and standards.
Several years ago, the company expanded into geothermal. The move was motivated by observing poor drilling performance and project management in many geothermal projects. The move will support the global transition to more sustainable energy. The company saw this as an opportunity to bring its bread and butter—improving drilling performance and technologies—into the geothermal sector.
The more the company transitioned to geothermal, the more clients’ needs grew. Black Reiver Consulting gathered a team of experts to meet this demand, partnering with Tony Pink and contracting geoscientists Ben Adams and Lucy Cotton. The company now has a team with a second-to-none technical background, with competencies in seismic interpretation and reservoir modelling complementing their combined drilling expertise.

“What we are doing right now is a lot of due diligence in projects and technologies for potential investors,”
#### Translation of “Our Hidden Powers”
Black Reiver joined the EGEC at the same time as Baseload Capital. This coincidence allowed the two companies to interact and explore collaboration, eventually paving the way for a Ukrainian translation of the “Our Hidden Powers” children’s book.
A key part of this collaboration was Daria, who specializes in translating and interpreting technical training courses, regulations, and standards and consulting as a linguistic expert for Black Reiver. “It’s not quite my cup of tea, but I have a daughter, so I hope I know how to talk to children,”
Daria emphasized that the geothermal industry in Ukraine is at a very early stage of development. Thus, it is even more important to start educating people about renewable energy to give them an idea about its place in the country’s and the world’s energy structures.

The children’s book may be useful for parents who know little about the energy industry. It is written in simple language and comes with lovely illustrations. With the translation, geothermal energy can become less of a mystery to children and adults in Ukraine.
Supporting energy education in Ukraine is now more important than ever. Just a few weeks ago, the Russians attacked the Ivano-Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas. Black Reiver was scheduled to deliver a training course there, and the university was also originally the venue of the Ukrainian geothermal conference.
“They want to kill academia and knowledge in the industry, so we have to work to counteract it,” c
#### Ukraine at an excellent position for geothermal growth
Geothermal in Ukraine, being at an early stage of development, has its advantages. It means that Ukraine has plenty of lessons from projects globally to learn from and plenty of proven technologies to choose from. It also means that they do not have to repeat the mistakes that others have made.
Russian attacks have heavily damaged Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. When the war is over, this infrastructure will have to be rebuilt. Geothermal provides compelling value as an energy installation that will be very difficult to destroy beyond repair, unlike nuclear or coal.
One of Ukraine’s many notable achievements was its ability to sell electricity abroad, even during wartime.
Ukraine also has a large human capital for well construction. The drilling industry in Ukraine dates back to the end of the 19th century. The local drilling industry may not be the most edge-cutting in the world, but plenty of people in Ukraine know how to drill a well.
An existing energy export mechanism, a relatively low-cost base, and a large human capital for drilling make geothermal energy in Ukraine worth investing in.
#### Establishing new standards in geothermal drilling
Kevin, Daria, and Tony are involved in developing geothermal well classification as part of the
This effort aims to bring some order into geothermal drilling by setting unified definitions and standards to create clear and transparent guidelines that can be used by project developers, investors, shareholders, and regulators worldwide.
The IADC is expected to make presentations and give updates on the progress of its work on establishing these standards.

The local council of Rülzheim, Germany has expressed support for a planned geothermal exploration drilling by Deutsche Erdwärme.

A 19,000 square meter area between Rülzheim and Bellheim in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany has been approved for geothermal drilling to explore the potential for geothermal heating or power in the region. However, additional approvals will still be needed for drilling to commence, which is expected to take anywhere between five to eight years.
The two properties being eyed for geothermal drilling had previously been designated in the regional plan as “priority area for agriculture” and “regional green belt.” To make drilling possible, the local council initiated a target deviation procedure (“Zielabweichungsverfahren”) for the area which will allow developers to deviate from the original objective for the location.
Based on an evaluation of existing geological data,
The selected project site is located far from the community, so no residents will be affected by noise, steam, or light from the geothermal operations. Moreover, the eastern side of the project site borders no nature reserves, the project can be developed without effects on any protected areas.
Susan Weber of Deutsche Erdwärme is optimistic that the project can be developed and that the geothermal resources at the site can be used for 30 to 40 years. The company is currently developing the Graben-Neudorf geothermal site where geothermal waters at more than 200 °C have been found.
However, additional approvals will still be needed before drilling can begin in Rülzheim. The local council has expressed support for the project, but the municipal council will still need to approve. The Structural and Approval Directorate (SGD) will then give their decision on whether drilling can begin. Weber estimates that it will still take at least five years before any drilling can take place.

The 15-MW Takahinatayama geothermal power plant is proposed to be constructed in the city of Osaki in the Miyagi Prefecture. The facility is expected to be operational by 2032.
The project area is located within the Kurikoma Quasi-National Park. Thus, the company intends to consult with relevant agencies to ensure that the impact on the forest is kept to a minimum. The EIA document also details potential impact on wildlife and vegetation.
J-POWER currently operates three geothermal power plants in Japan – the 46-MW Wasabizawa power plant, the 14.9-MW Onikobe geothermal power plant (which was recently rehabilitated), and the 14.9-MW Appi geothermal power plant which started operations in March 2024.

Geothermal energy is playing a crucial role in decarbonizing district heating. At the forefront of this transition is
With the economics of geothermal energy demanding a swift transition from design to heat production, where tighter budgets necessitate faster project timelines, Innargi is setting a new benchmark for this with two large-scale geothermal projects in the city center of Aarhus and North of Copenhagen.
Impressively, their first geothermal plant in Aarhus is planned to deliver its first heat in September 2025, just 26 months after the seismic acquisition ended—showcasing the speed and efficiency needed to make geothermal a scalable and impactful clean energy solution.
Once completed, these projects will collectively deliver over 130 MW of heating through 19 geothermal wells, reducing CO2 emissions by more than 165,000 tonnes annually.
Emil Stürup-Toft, Lead Geoscientist at Innargi, and Claudio Strobbia, Chief Research Scientist and CEO of
#### The importance and impact of the seismic data
“Before acquiring seismic data, we were operating with limited subsurface knowledge in Copenhagen. We knew geothermal potential existed—thanks to a well drilled 25 years ago that had performed beyond expectations —but we lacked certainty about the extent of the geothermal system. Seismic wasn’t a deciding factor in whether to pursue the project, but rather a crucial tool to confirm our geological model.”Emil explained.
_“We needed to verify whether the productive system extended far enough north and south, as we had hoped. We also knew a basin-bounding fault ran through the center of Copenhagen, but we required precise imaging of its location, as this fault significantly influences geothermal potential on the city’s eastern and western sides._
_“Seismic data proved invaluable in identifying areas with geothermal potential and refining our understanding of the system’s extent. A positive surprise was that the system stretched even farther than expected, both north and south, reinforcing confidence in our development plans._
Emil also commented on the need for seismic in Aarhus:_“In Aarhus, the seismic survey played a critical role in refining our drilling strategy within the pre-selected area for geothermal development. With the site already contracted, the data was essential for pinpointing the most suitable drilling locations, ensuring optimal well placement, and minimizing geological risks._
_“The seismic data helped us avoid potential hazards, ensuring we didn’t accidentally drill into a fault, which could have had undesirable consequences, ranging from increased operational costs and reduced reservoir efficiency to potential loss of well integrity.”_

#### Acquiring seismic in densely populated and complex cities
Urban seismic acquisition presents a unique set of challenges, and the projects in Copenhagen and Aarhus were no exception. Conducting surveys in the heart of these large cities meant navigating narrow streets, historic landmarks, underground metro lines, and a complex network of utilities. Ensuring minimal disruption to residents, businesses, and infrastructure was a top priority for Innargi.
_“In the most densely populated areas of Denmark, in the height of summer, where tourism activity added to the complexity of our operations, we placed seismic receiver nodes across the city centres, including in front of landmarks like Tivoli Park and the Danish Parliament,”_ explained Emil. _“It was one of the most challenging environments you can imagine for good quality seismic acquisition.”_
Securing approvals and gaining buy-in from local stakeholders before the survey began was relatively seamless, thanks to the proactive communication strategy applied, the modern technology used during the survey, and their flexible approach to survey design and acquisition operations.
To address any public concerns, Innargi leveraged TV, radio, and newspapers to inform the public, reassure them about how minimally invasive the survey would be, and emphasize the long-term benefits of clean heating that would be available to them in just a few years. This transparent approach led to minimal concerns from the public during the acquisition phase.
The use of
To further minimize disruption, Innargi reduced source efforts near historic and vulnerable buildings and conducted operations at night, ensuring minimal disturbance to the local community.
As a result, the survey was virtually invisible to most passersby or local residents. The only indication that a survey was taking place was when the Vibroseis trucks passed quickly through the streets at night for the source operations.
_“We were pleasantly surprised by how few nodes were tampered with,”_ Emil noted._“People were curious but generally respectful. Some even mailed back nodes they had picked up!”_

#### Ensuring high-resolution seismic data was acquired and delivered quickly
_“The ability to deploy a dense seismic node network without disrupting road traffic or daily life in the city was crucial.”_ said Claudio Strobbia from RTS. “We leveraged our fleet of STRYDE nodes to acquire the data efficiently.”
Thanks to the compact size and autonomous functionality of these nodes, RTS was able to deploy a high-density array with just 10 meters between each node, all while avoiding additional costs. This dense array, combined with nighttime operations to minimize anthropogenic noise interference, resulted in data quality that exceeded expectations.
“In our experience, urban environments are notoriously challenging for seismic acquisition, but the results we obtained on these two surveys were exceptional. The combination of a dense receiver grid, long offsets, and optimized source effort enabled us to produce highly accurate subsurface images.”added Claudio.
Once the data was acquired, RTS processed it with exceptional speed, delivering high-resolution seismic images for Innargi in record time. These insights played a crucial role in refining the geological model, mapping fault lines, and pinpointing the most promising locations for geothermal wells.
RTS migrated images just hours after acquisition to conduct initial checks, with full processing completed within weeks. For the Copenhagen survey, operations wrapped up mid-June, and by mid-July, Emil, and his team were already reviewing the initial data, with the final processed versions and report completed by August.
RTS’s approach contrasts sharply with traditional, larger processing firms, where the process is often found to be slower. “Working with RTS, I experienced a highly interactive and tailored service, ensuring that queries were resolved quickly, rather than waiting for weeks on end to see results.” .
#### The impact on Denmark’s energy future
The success of these seismic campaigns has already translated into real-world impact. In Aarhus, Innargi’s first geothermal facility, informed by the seismic survey, is set to begin producing heat in September 2025. In Copenhagen, the data has guided site selection, which will ensure that future geothermal wells are optimally placed for maximum efficiency and longevity.
_“This was a hugely rewarding project,”_ Emil reflected. “Seeing something that started as an idea on paper transform into a fully operational geothermal plant is incredibly exciting.”
#### Learnings for future urban geothermal exploration
The success of these projects highlights the transformative impact of full transparency with local communities, adaptable survey design and operations, autonomous seismic technology, and advanced data processing in urban geothermal exploration.
One of the most critical factors affecting data integrity is shot point gaps. “In urban environments like Copenhagen and Aarhus, access constraints, road bends, and infrastructure limitations made it challenging to achieve consistent shot point coverage. While missing a few nodes in a dense receiver layout is manageable through regularisation, larger gaps in shot points are much harder to compensate for, making it essential to minimize them wherever possible.”

_“Looking back on how we could have further improved efficiency, reducing source effort and deploying two smaller fleets simultaneously could have improved shot point coverage while increasing acquisition speed and minimizing disruptions. While long offsets can provide valuable data, a 6 km offset was found to be sufficient for these geothermal targets, as longer distances resulted in diminishing returns,”_ added Claudio.
With STRYDE’s innovative nodal technology, RTS’s expert seismic acquisition and processing, and Innargi’s geological expertise and commitment to sustainable energy development, this project serves as a benchmark for future geothermal initiatives in densely populated regions.
As Europe moves toward a greener energy future, the success of these Danish projects demonstrates how advanced seismic acquisition is rapidly unlocking new opportunities in geothermal energy, helping cities transition away from fossil fuels and toward a more sustainable future.

“EIA Not Required.”
The company, which uses geothermal resources for greenhouse heating, plans to expand its capacity with new drilling.
Due to the insufficiency of the areas covered by the existing EIA decision dated June 8, 2021, 12 additional geothermal resource drilling operations are planned in newly designated areas.
#### Capacity expansion with new drilling
The project aims to drill wells at 1,350 ± 150 meters in depth for resource assessment. If sufficient temperature and flow rates are achieved, the resources will be used for greenhouse heating. A new EIA review will be required before production begins.
Officials emphasize that geothermal energy will boost agricultural production and improve energy efficiency in greenhouse operations.
Konya is one of the regions in Türkiye that has a well-developed geothermal agricultural sector. The country leads globally in geothermal greenhouse cultivation, and sector representatives believe that further investment in this field can contribute greatly to addressing the crises in food and agriculture.

Superhot rock energy refers to geothermal energy harnessed from deeper, hotter dry rock systems with temperatures of over 400 °C. These systems can supply about five to ten times more energy per well compared to conventional hydrothermal systems. The CATF had previously published a comprehensive report on superhot rock systems, as well as an interactive map that highlights superhot rock projects around the world.
#### The potential of superhot rock in the Middle East and Saudi Arabia
According to a heat model developed by the CATF that estimates the depth to reach +400 °C temperatures, superhot rock exists across ~40% of the Middle East’s land area, amounting to more than 2.5 million square kilometers, at depths between 3 km and 12.5 km. A majority of this potential is located in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is well endowed with superhot rock resources and leads the region in total heat accessible with current or next-generation drilling technologies (estimated to be 12.5km or less). According to the model, the available heat in Saudi Arabia has the potential to provide 1,791 GWe of energy capacity, roughly equivalent to a gross revenue stream of USD 1 trillion annually.
Fully realizing the potential of superhot rock can produce enough electricity to meet the total yearly electricity demand of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This includes the electricity consumed for seawater desalination which provides about 70% of Saudi Arabia’s drinking water. With over 15,000 TWh to spare, superhot rock energy can support a growing energy demand and catalyze new export-based economies of zero-carbon fuel production.
#### Harnessing oil and gas expertise
The
For example, an intensive drilling and resource development program by well-funded consortia that include oil and gas industry players could provide the knowledge and innovation needed to develop and rapidly commercialize superhot rock energy.

![ ]( Carlo Cariaga 3 Feb 2025
Zanskar Geothermal & Minerals has drilled a highly productive well at Lightning Dock geothermal field, New Mexico, validating the thesis of untapped potential.
![](
![](
![](
The production well exhibited a productivity index of around 50 GPM/psi and fluid temperatures of around 325 °F (162 °C). The well was self-discharging at 1000 GPM, but with a high-flow pump installed, the well was modeled to produce around 5000 GPM at 330 °F (165 °C).
The directional well was drilled into a fracture zone at 7500-8000 feet (2286 – 2438 meters) deep. It was a large-diameter well, with Zanskar optimistic that the reservoir will have exceptional productivity and flow.
The estimated capacity of the well is estimated to exceed 200 MWth, and will be more than enough for the 15 MWe Lightning Dock power plant. It is also positioned to become the most productive pumped geothermal well in operation in the USA.
#### Real-world validation of Zanskar’s thesis
This outcome of the drilling confirms the incredible potential of the Lightning Dock resource and is strong validation of part of the thesis of Zanskar – which is that hydrothermal geothermal resources (sometimes referred to as “conventional”) can produce far more energy than the industry has historically shown.
The drive to validate this thesis was part of Zanskar’s reason for acquiring the Lightning Dock geothermal field from Cyrq Energy in 2024. The geothermal field was put up to sale due to underperformance issues. However, Zanskar had already collected unique data in the region and saw it as an opportunity to test their approach.
The new production well was drilled and tested less than 8 months after the acquisition, with the outcome as positive as the company had hoped. Zanskar remains committed to the perspective that hydrothermal resources can be more productive than previously determined by the industry, and that modern tools and technologies will help to tap deeper into these resources and target them more accurately and precisely.
While Zanskar has made no pronouncement of their future plans yet, the company is determined to prove that the productive well is not a “one-hit wonder” for the Lightning Dock geothermal field.

DHI has currently identified about 10 hot spring sites for geothermal exploration, including notable locations Gasa Tshachu, Gelephu Tshachu, Koma Tshachu, Chubu Tshachu, Duenmang Tshachu, Dhur Tshachu (Bumthang), Gayza Tshachu (Gasa), Pasanglum Tshachu (Lhuntse), Yoenten Kuenjung Tshachu (Lhuntse), and Duemang Tshachu (Zhemgang).
Experts from ESMAP and ISOR had recently visited sites in Gasa and Gelephu Tsachu to do evaluations and collect samples, as well as conducted sessions with DHI and government officials to share their experience and offer training in some aspects of geothermal exploration.
According to DHI, analysis of the samples have already begun and early results indicate that there is potential for power generation at some sites, while others are better suited for heating. Further studies will still be needed to validate these results. Meanwhile, sample collection is ongoing at other hot spring sites in Bhutan.
#### A diverse renewable energy portfolio
“If the assessment reveals positive results, geothermal energy will complement hydropower, especially during periods of low river flow, and help reduce energy imports,”
The official added that other opportunities for geothermal energy utilization are being considered, including cooling and industrial applications like food drying and greenhouse heating. The value of geothermal sites for tourism is also under consideration.
Bhutan joins India in recent exploration efforts for geothermal in the South Asia region. In August 2024, government-owned coal mining company a 20-kW geothermal pilot power plant in the Manuguru area in Telangana, India.

Speaking on the designation, “This declaration cements Kenya’s commitment to industrialisation, job creation, and sustainability…. aligning with Kenya’s vision of becoming a global leader in renewable energy-driven industrialization.”
The Olkaria SEZ will support industries in green manufacturing, agro-processing, electric mobility, and data centres, among others. With its strategic location along key transport corridors, including the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) and the Nairobi-Mombasa Highway, the Olkaria SEZ will provide investors with seamless access to both local and global markets.
According to KenGen, the park is expected to attract industries such as Agro-processing and companies seeking sustainable and cost-effective power for food processing and value addition, textile and apparel manufacturing, electric mobility production, Data centers and ICT firms, all looking to transform their businesses into fully sustainable, green-powered enterprises.
“With industries globally transitioning to net-zero operations, the Olkaria SEZ offers an ideal platform for businesses looking to integrate renewable energy into their production processes. By directly connecting industries to geothermal energy, we are not only lowering operational costs but also reinforcing Kenya’s leadership in green industrialization,”
With government backing, private sector interest, and KenGen’s commitment to providing reliable clean energy, the Olkaria SEZ is set to become a cornerstone of Kenya’s industrialization strategy. The first phase of investor engagement has already begun, with several multinational firms expressing interest in setting up operations within the SEZ.

400C Energy aims to develop a 275 °C pilot well pair with 100 kg/s of sustained flow rate, representing nearly 20 MWe of power output – which would be a record breaking EGS well pair.
This announcement follows recent news of the company acquiring 1960 acres of geothermal exploration rights in Salt Cove, Utah.
“We are excited with the acquisition of this asset as it will allow us to demonstrate our EGS technology at a much lower capital requirement. We’re optimistic that the first pilot deployment of our tech will provide a step-change increase in power output. It’s critical that we have a technical breakthrough in EGS to attract much needed capital and developers to the geothermal industry,
“Next-gen enhanced geothermal is a significant contender for clean firm power generation – the Western US has vast resources of Tier-1 dry, hot rock waiting to be unlocked with our superhot-capable technology.”
400C’s proprietary stimulation technology is rated to over 400 °C and incorporates flow control devices into the injection and production wells to improve power output and increase the life of the reservoir.

A new phase has been achieved in the Simav Geothermal-Based Greenhouse Organized Industrial Zone (TDIOSB) project in Kutahya, Türkiye. In the area where construction equipment and personnel from the Kutahya Provincial Special Administration are working, leveling of the roads between the planned parcels has been completed. Following this work, the tender process for infrastructure construction in the area was carried out.
The Simav TD?OSB project, established on a total area of 1,185,000 square meters, has allocated 828,502 square meters for technological greenhouses and 69,158 square meters as parcels designated for industrial facilities relevant to the specialized focus. The process of this significant investment is being coordinated by Simav District Governor Bünyamin Karaloglu.
With this new step taken in the Simav Organized Greenhouse Zone, the project is expected to be completed in the fall of 2025. The tender meeting held in the District Governor’s Meeting Room was attended by District Governor Karaloglu, Simav Mayor Kübra Tekel Aktulun, Simav Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Seref Kazcioglu, and Zafer OSB Director Göksel Ilgaz.
Seven different companies participated in the tender, which determined the firms that will undertake the infrastructure work. According to the tender specifications, the completion of the drinking water, wastewater, telecommunications, and electrical infrastructure of the Geothermal-Based Greenhouse OSB is planned for the last quarter of 2025.
Just about a month ago, the decision was made to drill a total of seven production wells and two reinjection wells to support the proposed geothermal greenhouse operations in Simav. The new TDIOS carries on the legacy of Simav an one of the pioneering locations showcasing the use of geothermal resources for greenhouse cultivation.

The Prime Minister of the Republic of Croatia, Andrej Plenkovic, has officially awarded the license for the exploitation of geothermal waters at the Lunjkovec-Kutnjak geothermal field to Bukotermal. With this development, the company can start the design and construction of the geothermal power plant, which will also be the largest investment in the history of the Varazdin County.
Bukotermal is a public company jointly owned by the Varazdin County (85%) and the Municipality of Mali Bukovec (15%). The license will allow the company to harness energy from geothermal resources at the Lunjkovec-Kutnjak field for 25 years.
“Northern Croatia is rich in geothermal resources, and I believe that the company Bukotermal will achieve success in the areas of research and exploitation. This project will enable the use of thermal energy, especially in the Municipality of Mali Bukovec,”
“The entire project has been designed in a meaningful and economically sustainable way,
The Lunjkovec-Kutnjak field was one of four geothermal concessions offered by the Croatian Hydrocarbon Agency for exploration in a bid round back in 2020. Exploration by Bukotermal thus proceeded in 2022, eventually determining a 16-MW capacity target for the planned geothermal power project. The exploration work indicated a geothermal resource with temperature of about 142 °C at a depth of 2.4 kilometers.
According to the studies done by Bukotermal, the geothermal field can support a capacity of 16.5 MW of electricity and almost 90 MW of thermal energy. The plan is to use the energy for electricity production, and also use the thermal energy to support the agrothermal and tourist sectors.
Bukotermal Director Alen Pozgaj stated that work is already underway on designing the hot water pipeline that will connect the Kutnjak 1 exploration well with the Lunjkovec 1 exploration well. The drilling of a new production well is also being planned.

With growing demand and a positive experience thus far, the town of Bóly in Hungary is upgrading and expanding their geothermal district heating system.

The town of Bóly in Baranya County in southwest Hungary is set to upgrade and expand their existing district heating system which was first developed back in 2004. The upgrade will cost around HUF 189 million (approx. USD 509,000) and will be co-financed by the local government, the Hungarian government, and the Swiss-Hungarian Cooperation Program (Swiss Fund).
The first thermal well in Bóly was drilled in 2004 at the city center, which was soon followed up with several additional wells. Since 2008, public institutions in Bóly have been supplied by geothermal water for heating. From 13 TJ in 2008, the amount of geothermal energy sold from the system has increased to 20 TJ. Accordingly, the total flowrate has increased from 125 to almost 200 cubic meters per year.
Dávid Fehérvári, the independent mayor of Bóly, said that the town’s experience with geothermal has been very positive, but the existing geothermal system has also reached its upper limit. With this in mind, the local government drilled a new well in 2023 to increase thermal water production. The next step would be to upgrade the technology of the system, which is the goal of the newly funded project.
The upgrade will be funded by HUF 93 million from the local government, HUF 14 million, the Hungarian government, and another HUF 81 million from the Swiss Fund (Elsewhere in Hungary, the Swiss Fund is also supporting a geothermal project at the Bundzsák Dezso Urban Sports Center in Kiskunhalas).
According to the project description, the investment will make establish new heating centers, upgrade the current technology to be more efficient, and build an additional five kilometers of pipeline. The new pipeline will serve businesses operating in the local industrial park and will supply geothermal heat to agricultural facilities, including a greenhouse and crop drying facility.

Representatives from PT PLN (Persero) Nusa Tenggara Development Main Unit (Unit Induk Pembangunan Nusa Tenggara / UIP Nusra) held a meeting with officials of the Lembata Regency Government in Indonesia, who confirmed their support for the Atadei geothermal power project.
The Atadei geothermal prospect is located in the Lembata Regency, part of the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia. PLN’S development plan indicates a capacity of 10 MW for the future geothermal power facility. Despite the modest size, this will be more than enough for Lembata Island, which is currently supplied power from a diesel plant with a capacity of 6.5 MW and peak load of 5.7 MW.
“We do not want Lembata to depend on diesel power plants forever. A diesel supply crisis could happen at any time, and we must have a long-term solution. Atadei Geothermal Power Plant is the answer to the future of clean and sustainable energy in this area,”
#### Local government to support land acquisition
During the meeting, PLN UIP Nusra explained that they are in the process acquiring the land needed for the two planned wellpads, AT-1 in Nubahaereka Village and AT-2 in Atakore Village. Of the 18 plots needed for the wellpads for AT-1, 12 have already been acquired. The acquisition of land for AT-2 is still under negotiation.
Michael Marrung, Land and Certification Manager at PLN UIP Nusra, stated that direction and support is needed from the local government for land acquisition to proceed smoothly and according to the appropriate regulations and requirements for community deliberation.
Representatives of the Lembata Government responded that they will immediately hold mediation meetings with the landowners to facilitate the acquisition.
For their part, PLN UIP Nusra guarantees that all crucial permits related to the development, starting from the Geothermal Working Area (WKP) permit, the development permit, and environmental impact assessment.
Yasir, General Manager of PLN UIP Nusra, also recounted how they have continued intensive communication with local governments and other stakeholders through the years. “Every time a regional head changes, we always hold an audience so that there is continuity in the development process. This is the main key to the success of the project.”
PT PLN, through PLN East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), is aiming to develop more than 70 MW of geothermal power generation capacity in the islands of East Nusa Tenggara. Aside from Atadei, the state-owned developer is also working on the Ulumbu, Sokoria, and Mataloko sites.

A new study by Daniel Dichter of
The full paper was presented at the 50th Stanford Geothermal Workshop and can be accessed in full
Many studies have already been published citing the significant benefits, in terms of power output and efficiency, of tapping into superhot geothermal resources, or those with temperatures at above 375 °C. Considering that most geothermal power plants currently operate at temperatures between 100 to 250 °C, little is yet known about how a geothermal power plant should be designed for much higher temperatures.
The study examines the design parameters and efficiency of binary geothermal power plants using different working fluids under a production temperatures of 300 to 350 °C. The standard working fluids are considered in the study (isobutane, butane, isopentane, pentane, cyclopentane), and compared with water. A double-pressure cycle was used for the simulations, as it strikes a balance between higher utilization and lower costs and complexity.
The maximum utilization or exergetic efficiency was used as the primary metric in comparing the different scenarios.
Comparison of utilization indicates that hydrocarbons generally are better options for binary power plants at temperatures below 240 °C. However, water outperforms butane and pentane at temperatures above 300 °C. As production shifts to become more vapor-dominated, the advantage shifts over to water with only cyclopentane providing comparable utilization numbers.
The study presents different power plant design scenarios comparing water and cyclopentane. The conclusion is that the higher critical temperature of water allows for more design flexibility, such as more cycle stages thus resulting in higher utilization. It also had other advantages, such as needing fewer wells, a smaller heat exchanger, and a smaller condenser.

_TM_) technology into real-time capabilities.
The project aims to transform drilling operations by delivering instant insights into subsurface state of stress and mechanical properties, along with real-time risk assessment and mitigation, all without the need for logging data.
Drilling operations account for a signification portion of the costs of subsurface projects. Better understanding of geomechanical characteristics allows for safer and more cost-effective drilling. Conventional methods often rely on limited datasets (logs), leading to uncertainties and inefficiencies in wellbore stability analysis. Using AI-based methods, Teverra’s DDG technology offers a game-changing solution, leveraging drilling dynamics data acquired through vibration sensors.
The grant will help Teverra extend DDG’s to enable real-time evaluation of geomechanical characteristics and wellbore stability while drilling. The company aims to introduce an end-to-end automated data analytics pipeline, offering real-time insights and recommendations at the rig site.
“This grant underscores Teverra’s commitment to innovation and sustainability in the energy sector,”“We’re excited to advance our DDG technology, proven reliable via multiple field testing, to real-time applications. Our goal is to bolster safety, slash costs, and boost efficiency in drilling operations through enhanced technology.”

Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) are poised to play a critical role in the global geothermal energy sector. With an estimated geothermal potential of 55–70 GW, the region remains an untapped powerhouse, currently utilizing only 1,751 MW of its capacity—just 11% of the global total.
At the forefront of geothermal innovation, ThinkGeoEnergy has partnered with GEOLAC since its inception, and this year is no different. As we prepare for the 11th annual congress in San Salvador, we are proud to announce the upcoming release of our whitepaper, “Geothermal Power in Latin America & the Caribbean: State of Play and Opportunities.”
### Key Findings from the Whitepaper:
Regional Leaders and Growth Opportunities:
* Mexico leads the region, accounting for 56% of its geothermal capacity.
* Emerging players such as Dominica, Bolivia, and Colombia showcase the region’s untapped potential.
Challenges to Overcome:
* High exploration costs (often due to remoteness of projects) and and lack of regulatory frameworks continue to hinder growth.
* However, technical advancements on drilling e.g. through Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), and targeted policy reforms offer hope for a brighter future.
Notable Projects and Innovations:
* Mexico’s Cerro Prieto remains one of the largest geothermal complexes, while Chile’s Cerro Pabellón highlights South America’s high-altitude potential.
* Modular geothermal systems are gaining traction in the Caribbean and in Colombia, ideal for small-scale energy needs.

The HEAT4LANDAU Project comprises of infrastructure necessary for 255MW of geothermal heat generation, transport, and delivery for the city of Landau starting in 2026. It is part of Vulcan Energy’s Phase One Lionheart project, which aims to supply lithium hydroxide derived from geothermal brine, at a volume equivalent to about 500,000 electric vehicles per annum.
Landau is the location of Vulcan’s existing upstream optimization plant (LEOP) and recently acquired Geox geothermal wells and renewable energy generation assets.
The BEW Funding programme is one of several grants under the German national government and European Commission initiatives for which Vulcan has applied. Vulcan’s financing of Phase One Lionheart Project has been timed to coincide with the completion of the public grant funding process.
The Company’s Phase One Lionheart Project financing process continues, led by BNP Paribas, with a debt structuring group including the European Investment Bank, Export Credit Agencies from Australia, France, Italy, and Canada, as well as major European banks ING, Unicredit, ABN-AMRO, and Natixis.

The EU-funded GeoHEAT project seeks to improve the success rate of deep geothermal projects by deploying borehole radar technology for subsurface imaging.
![](

The Georadar-aided High-resolution Exploration to Advance deep geothermal energy consumption (deep geothermal project development.
GeoHEAT was officially kicked off in June 2024 with a meeting held in Airolo, Switzerland. The project will run for 48 months and will receive EUR 4.2 million in funding from the EU, with additional funding coming from the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation.
GeoHEAT will transform geothermal exploration through two key strategic shifts:
1. Minimising pre-drilling exploration costs while quantifying and communicating the risks; and
2. Maximising learning rates of exploration drilling while reducing the costs of characterisation.
As a first step, the high costs and shortsighted prospection are tackled with passive surface-based imaging methods and uncertainty encompassing modelling alternatives. In parallel to reducing measurement bias, this approach engages a larger population and stakeholder group in search for optimal locations for geothermal exploitation.
In the following step, GeoHEAT illuminates the subsurface to an unprecedented extent through a novel georadar probe. The georadar imaging is complemented with drilling-induced microseismicity monitoring and digital rock physics models to create a high-resolution understanding of the reservoir.
Development of the borehole radar prototype that can function at high temperatures and pressures is a core aspect of the GeoHEAT project. This tool is designed to enhance the detection and mapping of geothermal reservoirs, providing information on the geology and structures at up to 100 meters away from the borehole. No such borehole radar tool currently exists.
To maximize its impact and expediate its success, GeoHEAT consists of a complementary consortium with European leaders in the scientific, industrial, and public domain. Members of the project consortium include:
* Fraunhofer IEG
* ETH Zurcih
* University of Geneva
* GuidelineGeo
* University of Pisa
* Mignan Risk Analysis
* Seismix
* ALT
* RWTH Aachen
* TU Delft
* Bo-Ra-Tec
The GeoHEAT also proposes effective and inclusive tools for public engagement and two-way communication, as well as the introduction of advanced decision-making tools for policymakers based on probabilistic modelling and uncertainty quantification.

![](
The Municipality of Amsterdam,
The Market Consultation is an initial step for an official tender planned for 2025. The Market Consultation documents have been posted on the
This Market Consultation has several objectives:
* To inform the market of the intended tender for the expansion of the cooperation;
* To gauge interest in this collaboration;
* To gain insight into the possibilities and ambitions of market parties with regard to the specific requirements and objectives applicable to the tender.
The information obtained from this phase will be used to prepare the tender documents. The Market Consultation is without obligation for all the parties involved, and participation does not put market parties in a favoured or disfavored position when tendering.
#### Details of the project
The project concerns the Mining Permit Geothermal Search Area Amsterdam-Amstelveen 1 that was assigned to the partners effective January 2023 and has a term of 4(+1) years. The aim of the partners is to develop geothermal sources for the further sustainability of the heating networks in the Amsterdam region.
Based on the available subsurface data (seismic and well data) in combination with the heat demand, the initial focus of the feasibility study for this lies in the southeastern part of the permit area; the sub-area “Amstelland”. An initial rough plan has been drawn up for the “Amstelland” project with the objective of having the first geothermal source operational in 2030.

The cooperation between the municipality of Amsterdam, Vattenfall and EBN initially concerns the feasibility phase. This phase is expected to last until mid-2026. The next step for this phase of the project is the acquisition of seismic data in Amstelland, which is already in the planning phase and is expected to commence in the spring of 2025.

Three companies,
Each of the consortium members holds a surface exploration permit covering distinct areas in the Yverdon-les-Bains region. They also come with different specializations and experience. Y-CAD SA, based in Yverdon-les-Bains and specializing in district heating. MalmEnergie Naturelle SA offers its experience in a first project in Montagny-près-Yverdon. Orllati Real Estate SA is a company specializing in construction and real estate development and the development of geothermal energy through its company Orllati Géothermie SA.
The first phase of the project, called “GeothermY,” is a data acquisition campaign that will start by the fall of 2025. this will involve establishing a 3D map of the subsoil, over an area of nearly 100 square kilometers covering 29 municipalities in the North of Vaud. In concrete terms, a system of small sensors (geophones) will be placed on the ground, in order to grid each area to be measured. Then, for approximately 4 weeks during the night, vibrating trucks will be in operation simultaneously in different areas of the territory, emitting vibrations every 30 meters.
If successful, it will be followed by a subsurface research phase using, for example, prospecting drilling, to more precisely define the parameters and characteristics of the subsurface and size a future geothermal exploitation facility.
Several surface research campaigns have already been deployed in the canton of Vaud, particularly in the regions of La Côte and Morges and in the Lausanne metropolitan area.

the starts of operations of the Kolo heating plant earlier this year.
With this development, the city of Konin now has a third heating plant, complementing the biomass boilers of the Konin power plant and a municipal waste disposal plant. Based on its design, the Konin geothermal heating plant will generate approximately 8100 GJ per year. The city is also considering putting up recreational facilities around the heating plant, located in Pociejewo.
#### A huge but worthwhile investment
The construction of the heating plant, as well as the drilling of the Konin GT-3 injection well, was facilitated with funding from the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management (NFOSiGW). However, efforts to explore for geothermal in Konin had started much earlier, with drilling of the first well completed back in 2015. Even then, the geothermal potential in Konin had been ascertained, with the well tapping into temperatures of up to 90 °C.
Slawomir Lorek, president of MPEC Konin, provided some details on how funding for the project was raised.
Of the PLN 67 million total investment for the project, PLN 26 million in funding an another loan of PLN 18 million came from the NFOSiGW. The local government then contributed PLN 4 million. The rest of the money from MPEC Konin.
“It is an expensive investment if we translate the total cost into the amount of installed capacity,” remarked Lorek.
However, Lorek also said that the heating company considered the value of geothermal as an energy source that is independent of geopolitics. MPEC Konin directly experienced the rise in biomass prices as one of the effects of the Russian occupation of Ukraine
Lorek also expressed optimism that the geothermal heating industry in Poland will continue to grow. With ten geothermal heating plants now built, the eleventh, in Turek, is already on its way. “We will close the year 2024 with 10 operational geothermal heating plants, but we would very much like to see another ten built within this decade,”

The Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) reported that OECS and New Zealand
This collaboration builds on New Zealand’s decade-long support for geothermal energy development in the Caribbean. The OECS is entering its 2025-2035 Decade of Action for Sustainable Energy Development, with geothermal energy at the core of its long-term strategy.
Dr. Didacus Jules, Director General of the OECS, emphasized the importance of this partnership: “We [are] beyond exploration now. Dominica is well advanced in its efforts, and we have relied very heavily on your expertise to assist in that process.”
As part of the initiative, the OECS is developing a Geothermal Direct Use Strategy to 2035, aimed at integrating geothermal energy into agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing. The strategy includes feasibility studies, regulatory frameworks, and a cross-sector working group to advance geothermal development.
Key Areas of Collaboration will enhance technical expertise through a capacity-building gap analysis, support the OECS GEOBUILD Programme, which is conducting a six-month study on geothermal skills and training needs across the region, facilitate collaboration on a geothermal resource mapping exercise to guide future development, and provide technical assistance services to support geothermal power generation.
According to Ambassador Te Puni, New Zealand is committed to delivering “practical outcomes for small island developing states,” helping to strengthen the Caribbean’s renewable energy sector.
With Dominica’s first geothermal power plant set to launch in 2025, the agreement is timely. The country is poised to follow Guadeloupe, home to the long-operating Bouillante Geothermal Plant, in bringing geothermal electricity generation online.
Chamberlain Emmanuel, Head of the Environmental Sustainability Division at the OECS Commission, highlighted geothermal energy’s role in the region’s renewable energy transition:
“We are looking at at least 30% renewable energy penetration across the OECS region, with a minimum of 20% per Member State by 2035. But then again, there will be a range of percentages across Member States. We do have the potential for countries with geothermal resources to exceed these targets and position us in an excellent way, and it’s clear that geothermal is really the backbone behind that transformation.”
The OECS GEOBUILD Programme, backed by the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Caribbean Development Bank, and the European Union Caribbean Investment Facility, is playing a central role in ensuring the long-term success of geothermal energy in the Eastern Caribbean.
With technical support from New Zealand’s Aotearoa New Zealand-Caribbean Facility for Renewable Energy (FRENZ), this initiative will help the region overcome workforce challenges, build local expertise, and strengthen energy security.

The focus of municipal heat planning is almost always on the potential of a municipality and thus typically ends at its limits. “We want to change that quite consciously here,”
“Sometimes the municipal heat planning shows that an area should continue to be supplied with heat in a decentralized manner in the future – that is, with its own heating in the basement or a small local heating network. By looking beyond our own horizons, we want to examine, among other things, the extent to which synergy effects can be created in the network construction between the municipalities involved.”
The ARGE is an alliance of the eight municipalities Aying, Brunnthal, Grasbrunn, Hohenbrunn, Höhenkirchen-Siegertsbrunn, Neubiberg, Putzbrunn and Taufkirchen, as well as the district of Munich, that was founded in July 2023. The goal of the alliance is to advance the heat transition in the southeast of Munich, with a special focus on geothermal energy as a heat source.

The municipal heat planning project, funded by the
“Municipal heat planning is a very important tool for the strategic development of heat supply in our district, which is currently still heavily influenced by oil and gas. Heat planning can be used to identify areas that can later be supplied sustainably with heat networks fed by geothermal energy, for example,”
The first step of the process will be to examine the current situation in each of the eight member municipalities. The potential for future heat supply within and across the municipalities will then be analyzed. Finally, various development options will be highlighted and an action plan will be developed that the municipalities can implement, both individually and together.
“The fact that eight municipalities are taking the lead here is an important sign that the heat transition is being taken seriously in our region. Because we must act now and set the course for the future. This will help the climate and increase the quality of life here in our homeland,”

Danish geothermal developer
“Our goal is to provide residents with clean, stable heat that is resilient to the volatility of energy markets,”
“Veolia continuously strives to introduce green solutions and the geothermal project is a proof of our commitment to an efficient energy transition and aligns very well with our global GreenUp strategy. Geothermal is another project we want to carry out with the City of Lódz in the area of district heating and the environmental challenges facing both the energy industry and local governments.”
Innargi once again comes to the project with their “geothermal energy as a service” business model. This means that Veolia will not bear the high investment costs associated with exploration of the resource, infrastructure construction, and operations. By reducing financial and operational risks, Innargi seeks to make geothermal a more accessible and attractive alternative for district heating operators.
“There are many advantages of geothermal heating, but its use in European district heating systems has so far remained limited due to financial and geological barriers,”
“We see Lódz as a key location on the geothermal investment map. I am sure that our offered business model makes it possible to introduce geothermal into the transformation process of Veolia’s district heating systems.”
Lódz becomes the second Polish territory in Innargi’s portfolio after the signing of a similar agreement (also with Veolia Energia Polska) in Poznan in early 2023. The company is currently at the construction phase of a heating plant for their first geothermal heating project in Aarhus, Denmark.

The contract was signed on October 4 by Exergy International’s Managing Director Luca Pozzoni and Kipa? Holding’s Vice Chairman Ahmet Öksüz, in the presence of Exergy Türkiye’s General Manager Erdogan Arpaci. This collaboration aims to contribute to Turkey’s sustainable energy goals.
These two binary geothermal power plants will utilize Exergy’s advanced ORC technology based on the Radial Outflow Turbine. The Emir GPP will feature a configuration with three turbines and two generators, while the Nezihe Beren 2 GPP will have one turbine and one generator. Both power plants will use air cooled condensers. Exergy’s technology will harness Maren’s geothermal resources at maximum efficiency and deliver clean baseload power to the local grid.
The project involves the local manufacturing of the turbines, generators, and other related equipment at Exergy’s subsidiary in Izmir, allowing the customer to benefit from Made-in-Turkey incentives. Once in operation, the two power plants will enable saving approximately 134,000 tons of CO2 emission per year, avoiding an equivalent fossil fuel power generation.

As part of the regular Focus on Geothermal Webinar series – a partnership of“Unmanned Aerial Experience: Drone Use Cases in EDC Geothermal Operations.”
As we highlighted in a recent article, Philippine geothermal developer and operator EDC has been using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or “drones” as part of their geothermal operations. This has allowed EDC to better streamline their operations by collecting critical data remotely and doing more regular inspection of surface assets.

Speaker:
Erickson del Rosario (Eric) has been with EDC for 14 years. He is currently the lead of GIS and Mapping services under the Applied Geothermal Technology of Energy Development Corporation tasked in delivering maps, spatial data requirements and developing GIS solutions for renewable energy operation. He is one of the few licensed Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) controllers of the company and a certified RPA flight instructor.
The expansive and isolated locations of the geothermal project sites facilitated the acquisition of drones for EDC’s daily operations. EDC drone units, which were originally created as additional equipment for security surveillance, are now used for a wide range of applications, including site investigation, geohazard monitoring, facility and pipeline inspections, aerial photogrammetry, and forest patrols. The company’s drone use provides rapid, intelligent, and efficient decision-making options.

The project took 10 months of work and involved the installation of 3 kilometers of pipes, 12 air handling units, and 3 heat pumps. Aside from reducing CO2 emissions by 75%, the Caen site is now also benefitting from a 70% reduction in gas consumption and 15% reduction in water consumption. The project has benefited from the support of the
The project is a world-first for Stellantis. The Caen site is also one of the first industrial facilities to adopt this type of technology in France. The project is fully in line with the environmental roadmap of the automotive company, with a target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2028.
The Caen site plans to further expand the capacity of the geothermal installation with additional drilling.
This installation is essential for reducing the site’s CO2 emissions. It also constitutes a performance lever for our installations in Normandy. Thanks to it, we can reduce our energy expenditure and reduce our dependence on market fluctuations,”
Stellantis is also exploring the use of geothermal energy at their industrial facilities in Mulhouse, eastern France and in Rüsselsheim, Germany. These projects are being undertaken in partnership with geothermal and lithium extraction company Vulcan Energy Resources. Moreover, Stellantis has invested into Vulcan Energy Resources and Controlled Thermal Resources, two companies that are developing technologies and projects for the direct extraction of lithium from geothermal brine.

MAPEG's 2024 activity report revealed striking figures regarding initial applications, exploration licenses, and operating licenses for geothermal projects in Türkiye.
![](
![](
![](
As of 2024, Türkiye’s geothermal energy potential has seen notable progress. According to the 2024 Activity Report published by the
Throughout 2024, a total of 638 initial geothermal applications were submitted, with November recording the highest number at 105 applications. These figures indicate continued investor interest in geothermal energy. While fluctuations have occurred in exploration licenses over the years, 412 new exploration licenses were issued in 2024. After peaking at 1,378 licenses in 2019, exploration permits have gradually declined in recent years.
Compared to exploration licenses, geothermal operating licenses remained relatively limited. Only 28 new operating licenses were granted in 2024, marking a significant decrease from previous years. The number of operating licenses, which stood at 318 in 2018, has steadily declined, reaching its lowest point in 2024. This sharp drop is seen as a critical issue for sector stakeholders and requires careful evaluation.

#### Legislative efforts and digital transformation process
MAPEG’s activity report highlights the ongoing legislative efforts related to geothermal resources and natural mineral waters, with regulatory processes continuing toward completion. Additionally, the transition to the E-Geothermal system, which aims to digitize geothermal operations, has not yet begun. Industry representatives emphasize that implementing this system would streamline the monitoring and management of geothermal investments.
While Türkiye still holds significant potential for geothermal energy investments, the decline in exploration and operating licenses is considered a critical indicator for the sector. With legislative updates and digital transformation efforts, the industry is expected to regain momentum.

Geothermal power generation is widely recognized as a renewable and low-emission source of energy. However, many geothermal reservoirs contain naturally occurring greenhouse gases (GHGs), including carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), which are released during power production. With increasing global pressure to decarbonize energy systems, geothermal operators are prioritizing emissions reduction to align with environmental, societal, and financial imperatives.
A recent paper presented at the 2024 Geothermal Rising Conference (GRC)Ian Richardson of Contact Energy Simon Webbison of Ormat
Why reducing geothermal emissions matters
Three key factors are driving the focus on reducing emissions from geothermal power plants:
1. Carbon pricing regulations
2. Public and societal pressure
3. ESG and financial considerations
Technologies for emission reduction
The paper categorizes the primary technologies used for emissions reduction in geothermal power plants:
* Non-Condensable gas (NCG) reinjectionPuna, HawaiiTe Huka, New ZealandCarbfix in Iceland
* Pumped binary systemsMcGinness Hills and Steamboat, Nevada, USA
* Gas purification and reuseKizildere in Turkey
Benchmarking global efforts
Richardson and Webbison’s catalog provides a detailed overview of geothermal power plants actively reducing emissions. As of 2023, the database includes sites from the United States, New Zealand, Iceland, Türkiye, and Germany
Call for collaboration
Simon Webbison recently emphasized the importance of industry-wide collaboration in his LinkedIn post
> “Something I am very proud of was last year putting together a paper for GRC with Ian Richardson to catalog (as of the end of 2023) the geothermal power facilities that were actively reducing their Greenhouse Gas Emissions. This paper is intended to act as a resource to help inspire ideas and to allow for accurate benchmarking. We’re starting to put together the Catalog as of the end of 2024, so if you know of any changes since this paper (or issues with the data we collated) then please get in touch and let us know.” – engage with Simon
Industry professionals are encouraged to contribute by sharing updates, corrections, or new case studies to ensure the catalog remains accurate and useful.
Conclusion
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from geothermal power plants is critical for the industry’s role in global decarbonization. As carbon regulations tighten and financial markets increasingly favor ESG-compliant projects, the implementation of emissions reduction technologies will shape the future of geothermal development.
